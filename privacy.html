        <p>We understand that your privacy is important to you and are committed to being transparent about the technologies we use. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Site.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Do we use Cookies?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Yes. We and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use cookies, web beacons, or pixels and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Site has the best possible experience.</p>
        <p><strong><em>What is a Cookie?</em></strong></p>
        <p>A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Why do we use Cookies?</em></strong></p>
        <p>We generally use Cookies for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>To recognize new or past customers.</li>
          <li>To store your password if you are registered on our Site.</li>
          <li>To improve our Site and to better understand your visits on our platforms and Site.</li>
          <li>To integrate with third party social media websites.</li>
          <li>To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising.</li>
          <li>To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.</li>
          <li>To better understand the interests of our customers and our website visitors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some Cookies are necessary for certain uses of the Site, and without such Cookies, we would not be able to provide many services that you need to properly use the Site. These Cookies, for example, allow us to operate our Site so you may access it as you have requested and let us recognize that you have created an account and have logged into that account to access Site content. They also include Cookies that enable us to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.  </p>
        <p>We also use functional Cookies and Cookies from third parties for analysis and marketing purposes.  Functional Cookies enable certain parts of the site to work properly and your user preferences to remain known.  Analysis Cookies, among other things, collect information on how visitors use our Site, the content and products that users view most frequently, and the effectiveness of our third party advertising. Advertising Cookies assist in delivering ads to relevant audiences and having our ads appear at the top of search results. Cookies are either “session” Cookies which are deleted when you end your browser session, or “persistent,” which remain until their deletion by you (discussed below) or the party who served the cookie.  Full details on all of the Cookies used on the Site are available at our Cookie Disclosure table below.</p>
