You are a trendsetter, trailblazer, creator, and builder, defining and shaping the culture and the systems that will define the next age of the decentralized internet.</p>\n<p>Over the years, we’ve built MetaMask to be a wallet without limits, designed for anyone who wants to do more with their crypto, engage with more dapps, and do it more safely. With MetaMask, there are no dead ends, no corner of web3 you can't explore, no dapp you can't connect with. And thanks to its best-in-class security, infinite extensibility, and powerful aggregation and curation in <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">Portfolio</a>, there's never been a better time for you to do more with MetaMask.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore further.</p>\n<h3>MetaMask Makes You More Powerful in Web3</h3>\n<p>MetaMask is your gateway to the decentralized web, offering unmatched connectivity to thousands of dapps across networks and devices. It enables users to self-custody their assets, securely manage their digital authority and confidently sign transactions on the web, on the go or natively in a dapp.</p>\n<p>MetaMask also brings the best of web3 to you. Instead of building “one size fits all” tools, we aggregate the best <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge\">web3 bridges</a>, DEXs, <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/metamask-portfolio/move-crypto/buy/how-to-buy-crypto-in-metamask/\">onramp providers</a> and staking protocols so you can choose the best tool for the job and manage your assets, without ever leaving the wallet.</p>\n<p>Users can effortlessly <a href=\"https://metamask.io/buy-crypto/\">buy</a>, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/sell-crypto/\">sell</a>, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/swaps/\">swap</a>, <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/send\">send</a>, <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">trade</a> and <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake\">stake</a> tokens, knowing they’re getting the best rates from dozens of trusted providers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6dHRywNHJJiA8QSTjMrYmA/65b8d3547dbfa9e80766090527df79ed/image2.png\" alt=\"MM UI 4\"></p>\n<h3>Configurability, Privacy, and Extensibility: More Control with MetaMask</h3>\n<p>MetaMask is also pushing the boundaries of user control, offering  unmatched configurability. We didn’t build a “take it or leave it” wallet, instead shaping MetaMask as a customizable extension of you. MetaMask, allows users to set the terms for how applications can interact with their  self-custodied data and digital assets.</p>\n<p>Nowhere is this configurability more important than with our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\">privacy features</a> that allow users to control even the most basic functionality of the MetaMask wallet - from RPC configuration and token management to custom security warnings and IP tracking. The default settings built into MetaMask to protect users are all configurable, because there is no one size fits all approach to privacy.</p>\n<p>Customize your privacy settings:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1dzDU2qvjGTBgel1Dawrzv/93e13b82e4b8dbf94ab4711099335fc0/image4.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p>Extend to any network:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1MqEAuFepQY4YxGCNWUuEm/b71f1d6c7aa6c68584bc76ede4f7f64c/image5.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p>Set your terms:</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6meGmGkI2K6Qhsm1tuKHN4/282e93d7cedea353b88d31bf1eb11cd2/image1.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p>Configurability is not limited to just what the MetaMask team has built. With MetaMask Snaps, users can tailor their experience, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/breaking-the-evm-barrier-with-interoperability-snaps/\">extend MetaMask to new networks</a> and even build their own extensions and customizations, without permission - that's permissionless innovation.</p>\n<h3>Do Everything in Web3 More Securely with MetaMask</h3>\n<p>None of this matters if users do not feel secure exploring the frontiers of web3.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security MetaMask offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. MetaMask offers Yooldo gamers the tools they need to protect against digital threats of every kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to begin your web3 gaming journey.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
