While crypto- and blockchain-related jobs were not specifically mentioned, MetMask’s Threat Intelligence and User Safety teams have heard many stories that indicate our community is particularly targeted. Any unsolicited job offers should be treated with extra suspicion, and you should never click links, download files, or view attachments from these untrusted messages. Definitely do not engage if “you are directed to make cryptocurrency payments to your employer as part of a job.”</p>\n<p>Evidence indicates that a significant number of these scams are related to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups that are often state-sponsored.

These researchers uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before bad actors are able to exploit them. However, as the Security Alliance (SEAL) <a href=\"https://securityalliance.notion.site/Introducing-the-First-Legal-Defense-Fund-to-Support-Crypto-Whitehats-e6792614a5b34c9f9f3f529caf975750\">recently explained</a>, web2’s history shows that “this important work can sometimes lead to significant legal risks and subsequent costs, particularly when their research and disclosures are unwelcome or misunderstood.” Therefore, SEAL has launched an initiative with the Security Research Legal Defense Fund to provide legal resources to eligible researchers who use the <a href=\"https://github.com/security-alliance/safe-harbor\">Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement</a>.</p>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1804708942981091516\">User Loses $11M to Signature Phishing</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On June 22nd, a user signed multiple permit phishing signatures, which resulted in a loss of US$11 million worth of tokens. It was further revealed that the victim was a MakerDAO governance delegate. SEAL researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1795055077209579838\">Pcaversaccio believes signature phishing is the biggest problem in our industry</a>, stating users don’t care about the warnings and they consider the consequences of signing them. <a href=\"https://dune.com/tayvano/sha-zhu-pan\">MetaMask's @tayvano revealed a total estimate of $600M+ in damages from approval phishing scams since 2021.</a></p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users can protect themselves by following three primary steps. (1) Limit the assets of the wallet you browse daily with. If you sign a malicious signature, the impact will be minimized. (2) Validate the domain the signature request originates from and verify it matches the domain of the original project. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the project's official social media or blog page and check that the domains from these profiles match the request. (3) Validate the token and address contents of the request. The request will often involve a token you did not intend to send. The <code>spender</code> address and or the <code>to</code> address of the transactions will be different than the address you intended. These simple checks can save you from unintended fund loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/299099/attacker-sends-nearly-24000-phishing-emails-derived-from-compromised-coingecko-third-party-email-platform\"><strong>23K Phishing Emails Sent After CoinGeko's 3rd-Party Email Service is Compromised</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, experienced a data breach on June 5 due to a compromised account at their third-party email marketing platform, GetResponse. An attacker accessed nearly 2 million contacts and sent 23,723 phishing emails from another client's account within GetResponse. The breach exposed users' names, emails, IP addresses, and locations, but CoinGecko's user accounts and passwords remained secure. CoinGecko is investigating the breach with GetResponse, informing affected users, and reviewing security procedures to enhance protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It’s recommended that users use caution when approaching emails about claim airdrops or tokens. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Crypto projects should be aware of the security controls used by the third-party vendors they are collaborating with.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://slowmist.medium.com/unraveling-how-a-malicious-extension-stole-a-million-dollars-e847a83cc50e\">\nSlowMist Reveals How a Malicious Aggr Chrome Extension Stole $1M+ in Crypto</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Aggr, marketed as a trading data aggregator, is a Chrome extension. In early June, a Binance user reported a loss of US$1 million in cryptocurrency, which was traced back to the Aggr plugin as the attack vector. SlowMist uncovered that Aggr harvested the cookies of traders utilizing the extension, specifically targeting cookies associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. With these cookies, the malicious actors behind Aggr were able to gain entry to Centralized Exchange (CEX) portals and take control of the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It's crucial for users to be vigilant when downloading any software onto their computers, including applications from browser stores. Researching the developers of extensions is an important step in ensuring safety. A simple review of their personal profile or recent track record should give you a good gauge of whether you can trust them.

So this month, MetaMask unveiled Smart Transactions that can deliver a 99.5% transaction success rate, MEV protection, pre-simulation, and improved gas settings. As our Executive Product Director Gal Eldar put it:</p>\n<p><em>“At MetaMask, we believe that wallets are uniquely positioned—and in many ways responsible—for addressing these user pain points head-on. The creation of Smart Transactions serves as our commitment to take an even more active role in tackling some of these challenges and to continue innovating at new layers of the wallet experience as part of our efforts to make the process of submitting transactions not just easier and safer but also more efficient and predictable for everyone. Democratizing access to decentralized technologies is a long and winding journey, and Smart Transactions are an important and bold step toward this end.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys/\"><strong>User Guide: Secret Recovery Phrase, Password, and Private Keys</strong></a></p>\n<p>In our continuous quest to educate our users, this recent support article co-authored by Oliver Renwick and Joel Willmore is aimed at teaching newcomers tips to avoid getting themselves rekt.

Pink Drainer recently announced they are shutting down citing: “We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it's time for us to retire.” Despite Pink Drainer's end, the threat of similar operations looms. Pink Drainer wrote, “It is very likely that our retirement will have no major impact on the scene, people will move on to other drainers just as quickly as they moved to us.”</p>\n<p>Although Pink Drainer is retiring, there are still other popular active wallet drainers.

Initially focusing on government agencies to steal intelligence, it shifted in 2014 towards targeting global financial institutions and virtual currency trading venues, engaging in the theft of money and assets. The group has employed phishing attacks through fake social accounts that offer bogus job opportunities to individuals in specific industries. Recently, security researchers uncovered a series of attacks involving ZIP files with malicious JS code targeting blockchain developers through job postings on platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and Braintrust. These attacks, consistent with Lazarus's \"Contagious Interview\" campaign, involve tricking candidates into running malicious code that steals crypto-related information and implants malware.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against phishing and malware attacks like those executed by groups such as Lazarus, it's crucial to verify the legitimacy of unexpected job offers through independent research and to maintain robust digital hygiene. This includes using up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security, and exercising caution with email attachments and links from unknown sources. Additionally, keeping all software updated is essential to guard against exploitable vulnerabilities. By adopting these practices, individuals can significantly bolster their defenses against sophisticated cyber threats and safeguard their sensitive information</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/etherscan/status/1788550675993174409\">Address Poisoning Attacks on the Rise, leading a recent victim to a $68M Loss</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Address poisoning is a deceptive tactic where attackers manipulate victims' transaction histories to trick them into sending funds to the wrong address. This method involves creating fake tokens, using 'vanity' addresses that closely resemble the target's, and exploiting the ERC-20 token standard's \"transferFrom()\" function. Attackers employ these strategies to conduct zero-value token transfers and spoofed token transfers, making their fraudulent addresses appear legitimate. These attacks are designed to confuse users into copying the wrong address for their transactions, leading to financial losses. The sophistication of these methods highlights the evolving nature of cyber threats in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against address poisoning, users should avoid copying addresses directly from their transaction history and instead, copy them from a trusted source. Implementing domain names for addresses can enhance distinguishability, though users must be cautious of domain name spoofing. Utilizing an address book feature provided by wallet services or adding a private name tag on platforms like Etherscan to whitelist trusted addresses can help users easily identify and avoid spoofed addresses.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: May 2024","metaDescription":"2024 is flying by!

Security researcher ZachXBT shared a leaked message from an Inferno Drainer Customer group chat. It notified customers that the attacker had updated all customer addresses to the attacker's address. This means customers who performed a successful phishing attack on March 18 had the stolen funds redirected to the attacker's address instead of their customer's address.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Although this was related to an off-chain compromise, the original $2.5M came from victims of phishing attacks. Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">FTX and BlockFi users targeted in Email Phishing Campaign</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6BYDqB0JH0XweutJH4gsUy/3d91e6a33851bb1699815776f5d9f5d9/Screenshot_2024-04-01_at_12.45.45_PM.png\" alt=\"blockfi scam\"></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>FTX and BlockFi users lost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">more than US$ 7 million</a> on the Ethereum mainnet the week of March 18 as they were targeted in a phishing campaign.

Many users signed a malicious signature or interacted with a malicious contract, resulting in their wallets being drained of crypto assets. It’s reported that the email list used in this campaign likely came from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mailerlite-confirms-hack-crypto-phishing-email-3m-attacks\">the Mailerlite compromise</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when receiving emails asking them to connect their wallets and sign transactions. To prevent being scammed by impersonators, it is recommended that users check official communications from the organization. A simple search on BlockFi’s and FTX’s websites would have revealed that no official announcement allowed users to withdraw funds. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio’s MakerDao-Based Contract Exploited for $16M</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On the weekend of March 23rd <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio Ecosystem broke the news</a> that their MakerDao-based smart contracts on Ethereum were exploited. This resulted in a total loss of over $16M in crypto assets. All contracts on Polkadot and the Curio Chain itself remained secure. Curio recently posted its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1772354849029464278\">recovery strategy</a> roadmap, highlighting that 100% of funds will be restored to users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone who was a holder of Curio’s governance token was impacted. Unfortunately, this is a scenario where a user would not have been able to protect themselves from this attack, as it involved a vulnerability within Curios’ smart contracts. For those of you who are protocol developers, you can help prevent these attacks by ensuring your smart contracts are thoroughly audited. It's a best practice to have your smart contracts audited continuously with new releases. After completing an audit, projects should participate in a bug bounty program to incentivize researchers to find vulnerabilities in their contracts before threat actors do.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: March 2024","metaDescription":"Lots of exciting activity from ETHDenver and some new snaps additions are covered in this month’s installment.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/pcm-NG/news/security/page/2/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/download/","/news/","/swaps/","/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/security/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":4,"categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","category":"security","totalItems":34,"currentPage":2,"totalPages":9,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"e nor dey supported.
