Anytime an exchange is holding your crypto, they have full custody of how it can be handled. Always remember: “Not your keys, not your coins.”</p>\n<p>For developers, admins, and any parties responsible for managing the wallets of other users: It’s important to incorporate the use of multi-signature wallets. In order for an attacker to successfully compromise the multi-signature wallet, every key manager would have to be compromised significantly reducing the risk of an attack.</p>\n<h4><strong>Executives Lured on 'Business Trip' to Montenegro; Abducted and Forced to Empty Wallets.

Fantom initially broke the news in their Telegram channel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1714282750830928176\">claiming the fund loss was the result of a Chrome zero-day exploit</a>, but have not released any supporting evidence.

Since this fund loss incident impacted multiple wallets at the same date and time, we can determine that it was unlikely for each key holder to have fallen victim to a phishing attack on the same date and time. Fantom later disclosed in an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1714337765502992798\">official statement on X</a> saying that only 550K out of the total $7 million stolen belonged to Fantom Foundation, but never gave any new details shedding light on how the attack occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>How users can protect themselves</strong></p>\n<p>User’s funds are safe as this hack only affected employee wallets.

A solution created by the Yearn team that MetaMask is adopting involves creating an onchain calldata AllowList that prevents malicious actors from damaging crypto users in the event of a DNS hijack.</p>\n<p>Our developer relations team is now reaching out to third parties whose participation will be vital to the success of this initiative.

Gal from team LavaMoat, focuses in this document on the “same origin concern,” describing the lack of control apps have over new realms that rise under their own origin, as well as its implications on their safety, how current efforts to address it fail and what browsers can do to help ship a secure and performant solution for the problem, which was also presented to the W3C security work group this month.</p>\n<h1>In Other News…</h1>\n<br /> \n<h2>Taylor Monahan weighs in on losses possibly linked SRPs stored in LastPass</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>A string of high-value thefts totaling around $35 million worth of crypto from security-minded individuals in the tech industry may be linked to a breach disclosed by Last Pass almost a year ago. MetaMask’s Monahan has been following the clues since December 2022, and was quoted as saying “The victim profile remains the most striking thing. They truly all are reasonably secure. They are also deeply integrated into this ecosystem, [including] employees of reputable crypto orgs, VCs [venture capitalists], people who built DeFi protocols, deploy contracts, run full nodes.”</p>\n<p>The only major throughline Taylor has been able to find is that these <strong>victims used LastPass to store their secret recovery phrases</strong> at some point, and her tl;dr moral of the story is: <strong>“PLEASE DON’T KEEP ALL YOUR ASSETS IN A SINGLE KEY OR SECRET PHRASE FOR YEARS. THE END. Split up your assets. Get a [hardware] wallet. Migrate.
