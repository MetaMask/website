These catfishing schemes, which frequently involve a romantic angle, originated in China and have been dubbed shāz hū pán, or \"pig butchering,\" because the perpetrator will \"fatten\" up the target, stringing them along before the slaughter.</p>\n<p>Taylor put together a comprehensive overview in a Dune <a href=\"https://dune.com/tayvano/sha-zhu-pan\">dashboard</a> that “attempts to capture the magnitude of these scams via hard data pulled directly from the blockchain and people's stories, told in their own words.”</p>\n<p>From the dashboard: “These scammers are onboarding more people to crypto than any legitimate crypto organization.

Given the immutable nature of smart contracts, security should be prioritized, and any increase in functionality should be tested rigorously to prevent potential attack vectors. Gradually raising the limit of value locked within a new smart contract was suggested as a possible approach to enhance user protection.</p>\n<p>When asked about best practices for secure smart contract development, Harry suggested several key considerations, including prioritizing secure design principles, utilizing trusted libraries like OpenZeppelin, fostering a security-oriented mindset among developers, implementing comprehensive testing, and engaging professional code reviews.

Despite the inherent risks, he acknowledged that it's a practice that's regularly undertaken in the tech world. He explored the realm of JavaScript projects, particularly examining how they can proactively safeguard themselves from supply chain attacks. This proactive defense was discussed under the assumption that a downloaded dependency has already shipped with a malicious dependency. ZB suggested methods such as restricting access to globals for each package and controlling a package's ability to access the network or file system.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he addressed the important issue of eradicating prototype pollution, a common vulnerability in JavaScript projects. ZB also turned his attention to future JavaScript features, particularly those currently under discussion in TC39. He demonstrated how these emerging features can be harnessed to protect projects in the present. To provide a more practical understanding, ZB offered an engaging live demonstration, showing how to execute actual malware safely, thus emphasizing the importance and effectiveness of the defensive measures discussed.</p>\n<p><strong>Gal Weizman on LavaMoat</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MetaMask 🦊 is an amazing app for many reasons.<br><br>One reason I like especially is that even though it works just fine, the window object of the app is (almost) unusable!<br><br>If you&#39;re into Browser JavaScript security, come learn about what we call &quot;scuttling&quot; - by LavaMoat 🌋<br><br>Well.. <a href=\"https://t.co/uJ8oLxVizH\">pic.twitter.com/uJ8oLxVizH</a></p>&mdash; Gal Weizman (@WeizmanGal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeizmanGal/status/1674751159003914240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/weizmangal\">Gal Weizman</a> writes about the unique security feature implemented by MetaMask called \"<a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/360\">scuttling</a>\" via a homegrown tool named LavaMoat. The tool is designed to protect against supply chain attacks, a serious concern due to the complex graph of dependencies that MetaMask runs on. LavaMoat achieves this by creating a separate sandbox for each dependency using Secure ECMAScript (SES) by Agoric. Each sandboxed dependency is only granted access to the specific features it needs, preventing unexpected access to sensitive features.</p>\n<p>However, there's a chance that a dependency might manage to escape its sandbox using allowed APIs and reach the window object, potentially negating LavaMoat's protection. To counter this, MetaMask uses Compartments, also implemented in SES, to ensure that API instances provided to the sandboxes aren't the original ones from the global object. Consequently, unused original APIs can be removed from the global object, enhancing security by denying escaped dependencies access to unauthorized APIs.</p>\n<p>This process of removing APIs and properties from the global object is termed \"scuttling.\" It effectively makes the window object unusable but doesn't affect the app's functionality. Though theoretically sound, the application is challenging in practice, with certain properties still not scuttled. The MetaMask team provides further resources on scuttling and LavaMoat for those interested.</p>\n<h3>Security Laboratory</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>LavaMoat Update</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More LavaMoat awareness: In addition to the DevSecConf24 above, a video on the same topic will be available July 5 from <a href=\"https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/i-run-code-from-the-internet\">React Summit 2023 on Git Nation</a>, also presented by Zbyszek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a deep-dive into RN iOS native animation source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/docs/issues/9\">previous</a> investigation, the cause of assertion macros failing on parent and child nodes (thrown as exceptions executing the UI block) stems from failed WebView page loads upon navigation (also triggered by @babel/plugin-transform-runtime’s regenerator).
