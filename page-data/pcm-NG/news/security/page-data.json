The session, titled \"DPRK – all grown up\", highlighted North Korea's decade-long development of advanced cyber capabilities, enabling significant cryptocurrency thefts, and targeting organizations linked to satellites and weapons systems. Additionally, a presentation called \"China’s evolving cyber operations\" examined China's adoption of new tactics to enhance operational security, including the exploitation of vulnerable small office/home office (SOHO) devices to obscure their activities. These insights underscore the increasing sophistication and adaptability of cyber threats from these nation-states.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h2>\n<h3>ZachXBT: scammer stole over $6.5 Million by impersonating Coinbase Support</h3>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Crypto investigator, SEAL member, and all-around <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=A%20really%20hoopy%20frood&#x26;utm_source=owned-metamask&#x26;utm_medium=content&#x26;utm_campaign=cmp-852281-afbf08\">hoopy frood</a>, ZachXBT has uncovered a sophisticated phishing operation led by scammer Ronald Spektor, who impersonated Coinbase support to steal over $6.5 million in October 2024. Spektor lured victims by posing as official support, then laundered the stolen funds through TON-linked wallets, and deleted his social media accounts to evade detection. Despite these efforts, ZachXBT's investigation has identified untraced funds and potential accomplices, raising hopes that further leads may emerge to assist victims and authorities in recovering the stolen assets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Protecting yourself against scammers posing as customer support in the crypto space requires vigilance and proactive security measures. Here are some key strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify sources: only use official websites or apps to contact support. Avoid links in emails or social media.</li>\n<li>Ignore unsolicited contacts: legitimate companies don’t reach out unprompted or ask for urgent action.</li>\n<li>Protect sensitive info: never share private keys, recovery phrases, or passwords.

The incident occurred near University Avenue and Richmond Street West just before 6 p.m. The kidnappers forced Skurka into a vehicle and demanded the ransom, which was paid electronically. Skurka was later found uninjured in Centennial Park, Etobicoke. He assured the public that WonderFi's client funds and data remained secure and unaffected by the incident. Experts note that such attacks, though rare, can coincide with surges in cryptocurrency values, as criminals may perceive high-profile figures in the crypto industry as lucrative targets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Never underestimate <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/538/?utm_source=owned-metamask&#x26;utm_medium=content&#x26;utm_campaign=cmp-854281-afbf08\">the $5 wrench attack</a>, by which physical coercion (like threats or violence) is used to force someone to reveal private keys or access their crypto funds. If at all possible, keep a low profile and avoid flaunting your holdings in public. Diversify your storage by spreading funds across multiple software and hardware wallets, keeping the majority of your holdings in cold storage. Consider utilizing multi-sig wallets and time-locked transactions. And remember that if you are ever faced with this scenario, your life is more important than your crypto.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7KcxVQ1N9bizK9Yg0VhK1U/90b3501065495747dffc228493b686cd/A_crypto_nerd-s_imagination.png\" alt=\"A crypto nerds imagination\"></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Our MetaMask Security Report for November 2024 dives into safety news across crypto – featuring kidnapping, pig butchering, AI grandma, and more.

These schemes, documented in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, involve various deceptive practices, including reluctance to appear on camera. Part of a broader campaign to generate revenue for North Korea, these activities have been associated with the NICKEL TAPESTRY threat group, and contribute to the country's weapons programs. Recent operations, such as the Contagious Interview campaign, involve elaborate fake interview processes delivering malware to job candidates in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. The U.S. Justice Department has also highlighted a multi-year IT worker fraud scheme generating significant revenue for North Korea and evading sanctions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations can protect themselves from these sophisticated fraud schemes by implementing thorough verification processes for candidate identities, including checks on documentation and conducting in-person or video interviews. Monitoring for unusual behavior during interviews can also help identify potential fraud. Employers should be cautious of requests to change addresses or route payments to money transfer services during onboarding. Additionally, IT staff should limit unauthorized remote access tools, and restrict access to non-essential systems, mitigating the risk of intellectual property theft and unauthorized revenue generation for North Korea.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/angel-drainer-takes-over-infernos-tools/\">Inferno drainer hands over reigns to Angel Drainer</a></h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The crypto security landscape faces a potential escalation as Inferno Drainer, a notorious service known for facilitating crypto wallet thefts, has transferred its operations to Angel Drainer. This move could mark a new, more dangerous phase in crypto-draining activities. Inferno's decision to hand over its platform, including its extensive code base and features, to Angel Drainer is based on confidence in Angel's capability to manage and maintain the service. This transition is expected to keep clients' existing functionalities intact. Still, it raises concerns about the strengthened capabilities of wallet drainers, which have already contributed to significant losses in the crypto community.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Given the growing threats in the crypto-draining ecosystem, individuals should exercise increased caution. Protecting oneself involves being vigilant about phishing attempts, often through fake social media accounts and websites. Users should double-check the authenticity of any crypto-related communication, and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Implementing robust security measures for crypto wallets, such as using hardware wallets and enabling multi-factor authentication, can provide additional layers of protection. Staying informed about the latest security threats and following best practices recommended by crypto security experts can help mitigate the risk of falling victim to sophisticated drainers.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"MetaMask’s October 2024 security update uncovers DPKR workers hiding among web3 companies, what we’re doing to keep you safe from dangers like this, and more.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"31mn9FAWi6ZVyAwrV109y3","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: September 2024","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-september-2024","subtitle":"Our September security update dives into the $243M heist brought down by hubris, the quarterly MetaMask x Wallet Guard: State of Security, and more.","image":{"title":"MetaMask Security Report: September 2024","description":"MetaMask's September 2024 Security Report.

Developed as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), it disguises itself as legitimate software through an Apple disk image, prompting users for their password and MetaMask password upon execution. The malware then steals a variety of sensitive information, including cryptocurrency wallets and browser cookies, storing them in a directory for exfiltration. Cthulhu Stealer, similar in functionality to the Atomic Stealer malware, is part of a growing trend of macOS-targeted malware, underscoring the need for vigilance among Apple users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against threats like the Cthulhu Stealer, macOS users should only download software from trusted sources such as the Apple App Store or official developer websites. Enabling built-in security features like Gatekeeper, which blocks unverified apps, and keeping the system and applications updated with the latest security patches are critical steps. Additionally, using reputable antivirus software can provide an extra layer of protection. By staying informed about potential threats and adopting these proactive security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk of malware infections and safeguard their sensitive information.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://blog.phylum.io/smuggling-malware-in-test-code/\">Fake Developer Jobs Laced with Malware</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The sophisticated malware campaign that has been targeting developers with fake job advertisements for months shows no sign of letting up The malware, disguised as a legitimate npm package named \"execution-time-async,\" installs malicious scripts that steal cryptocurrency and credentials from the victims. The attackers cleverly hid the malware within a test file, exploiting social engineering techniques to lure developers into downloading and executing the compromised package. The malware may be part of a larger social engineering campaign, with ties to North Korean state-sponsored activities.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against such software supply chain attacks, developers should exercise caution when downloading packages, especially from unofficial sources. Always verify the authenticity of job offers and be wary of requests to download software as part of the application process. By staying informed about the latest threats and adopting a cautious approach to software installation, developers can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated malware campaigns.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580\">ZackXBT Uncovers DPRK Developers Working for 25+ Crypto Projects</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>A team recently discovered 1.3 million missing from their treasury, leading them to seek ZachXBT's expertise. The investigation revealed that the team unknowingly employed DPRK IT workers posing under fake identities as developers. This breach led to the laundering of the stolen funds through a complex path of exchanges, bridges, and mixers. ZachXBT then uncovered 25+ additional crypto projects that had hired DPRK developers.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>This incident underscores the critical importance of thorough vetting and monitoring of team members, especially in roles with access to sensitive operations. Teams should implement rigorous background checks, utilize secure code practices, and maintain strict oversight of treasury transactions.
