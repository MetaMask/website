Macroeconomic and geopolitical events, along with what’s been happening within the DeFi ecosystem have led to a lot of uncertainties. Nevertheless, MetaMask Institutional (MMI) continues to deliver new and important features. In the first six months of the year, we have launched:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-introduces-multichain-capabilities/\">Multi-chain capabilities</a> for custodian accounts</li>\n<li>The first iteration of the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI Portfolio Dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">Partnerships</a> with four new custodians</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-nft-tracking-within-its-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">NFT tracking capabilities</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>What’s next? MetaMask Institutional now has new reporting features available within its Portfolio Dashboard and browser extension.</p>\n<p>Typically, organizations spend well over 10 hours a month to capture data across various portfolios and protocols. Funds set reminders to take screenshots of balances across different protocols, then use these to provide valuations to their administrators. To help organizations save time, decrease the likelihood of error, and make monitoring and reporting of holdings easier, MMI is introducing Snapshots and Transaction Notes.</p>\n<h2>MMI Snapshots</h2>\n<p>Snapshots allows organizations to generate a read-only view of their trades over a given timeframe on the MMI Portfolio Dashboard. This read-only view highlights the organization’s  positions at a point in time, along with the transactions for that time period. This new feature takes daily snapshots of an organization’s holdings, which are consolidated into reports viewable by time period, and allow them to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View by time period; weekly, monthly, and quarterly</li>\n<li>View all portfolio items including, all assets, assets allocated to lending, borrowing, yield farming, staking, NFTs, rewards, and transaction history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these Snapshots generates a unique link, which can then be exported and shared with the fund admins, LPs, or any third-party provider. Organizations can collaborate, get detailed reports, track internally, and share them easily with different teams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/23275AqrzJv6YctYDZuTiP/1cc4852c80d166470aef4df07592f92e/4100-Portfolio-snapshot.png\" alt=\"4100-Portfolio-snapshot\"></p>\n<p>Snapshots works by taking daily snapshots. Therefore, to view these reports by time period, say weekly, monthly or quarterly, it will take time to populate with the first weekly snapshot available in users’ portfolio dashboards on July 8. MMI’s Snapshots feature is currently only available on the Portfolio Dashboard dapp.</p>\n<h2>MMI Transaction Notes</h2>\n<p>Transaction Notes allows initiators to include ‘reference notes’ or comments they would like to include for each trade. These notes are stored as transaction details, which will be sent to the custodian so other transaction approvers can see the text when they receive the notification. Think of it as a way of letting other users know what this transaction is about – making for easy viewing, and letting users keep track of all the ins and outs. This eliminates the additional time users need to spend to provide context and details of their trades to their fund admins.</p>\n<p>Organizations can now find a new “Note” tab on the confirmation dialog within the MMI Extension. This allows the user to add transaction details in the text box. When the transaction is submitted, the custodian receives all details including this note for approval or rejection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/JIM95o0vy2YuoOc45HBMH/12ba74ce70cb95ae0711bf68b1722d87/Screenshot-2022-07-01-at-15.11.28.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2022-07-01-at-15.11.28\"></p>\n<p>The Transaction Notes feature is currently only available within the “transaction details” in the MMI extension, and in the browser extension, but will soon be available on the Portfolio Dashboard.</p>\n<p>MMI Snapshots and Transaction Notes are live, and users will gain access as custodians roll out support for these features.</p>\n<p><strong>Eager to learn more?

With this partnership, MMI expands its cryptocurrency custody offerings to integrate custody options for Web3-native organizations such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>\n<p>Gnosis Safe is one of the most popular digital asset management platforms for DAOs, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">over $90B</a> worth of assets stored in self custody. Many DAOs, including Uniswap, Maker DAO, Aave, and Bit DAO use Gnosis Safe for their custody needs.</p>\n<p>DAOs prefer Gnosis Safe for its multi-sig security feature, which provides them with additional security to deploy funds. Using this feature, DAOs can ensure that multiple stakeholders sign off on a transaction before funds are released.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a deeper look into Gnosis’ multi-sig security, and why DAOs need it.</p>\n<h2>DAOs and their Unique Custody Needs</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/\">DAO</a> is a community-led organization that is designed to decentralize control. There is no central decision-making authority, and all important matters are decided on by all members of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Individual DAO members create a proposal such as those related to functioning, treasury allocations, even the future of the DAO. All members of the DAO can then vote on these proposals using their governance tokens. When a pre-decided consensus is reached on a proposal, then it is accepted and enforced by the rules coded within a smart contract.</p>\n<p>Since there is no central authority that is signing off on decisions, DAOs require multiple members to be signatories to their transactions. This is imperative to maintain the decentralization that is core to the structure of DAOs. This is where Gnosis Safe’s multi-sig feature is best suited for DAOs to manage their crypto transactions since it  requires multiple members to confirm the transaction before it is executed. This adds an extra layer of security to the DAO treasury and prevents unauthorized use of DAO funds.</p>\n<h2>MMI and Gnosis Safe Give DAOs Unrivaled Access to DeFi</h2>\n<p>Currently, DAOs can use Gnosis Safe to manage their funds in two ways. First, they can transact directly with the Gnosis Safe wallet and their ecosystem of apps called <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-gnosis-safe-apps-faef908f69c6\">Safe apps</a>. Second, they can connect their wallet of choice with Gnosis Safe using <a href=\"https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4356253-walletconnect-safe-app\">WalletConnect</a>. To do so, they have to scan a QR code to connect WalletConnect with the dapp they wish to use. This process is cumbersome, and also limits the DAOs access to the DeFi ecosystem to the dapps and protocols that WalletConnect supports.</p>\n<p>With MMI’s partnership with Gnosis, DAOs have a third, more convenient way to connect with DeFi. This gives them unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem because MMI connects to over 17,000 dapps. MMI also allows DAOs to join MetaMask’s 20M monthly active users across the globe in accessing Web3. In addition, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI’s DeFi and Web3 portfolio dashboard</a>, DAOs can get a holistic overview of their portfolio, its performance, individual assets, and historical transactions.</p>\n<p>“Gnosis Safe is a foundational cornerstone of our ecosystem—an unmatched and trusted platform on which most DAOs rely to secure and manage their digital assets. This integration, therefore, brings together these two important elements</p>\n<p>for organisations; unrivaled access and trusted security. We are, therefore, thrilled by this partnership and the further collaboration between Gnosis Safe and ConsenSys,” <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/metamask-institutional-x-gnosis-safe-45fc852b4186\">says Johann Bornman</a>, Global Product Lead for MMI.</p>\n<h2>MMI and Decentralization</h2>\n<p>The partnership between MMI and Gnosis Safe also strengthens ConsenSys’ commitment towards Web3-native organizations, and towards Ethereum’s goal of decentralization.</p>\n<p>A decentralized web is a cornerstone of ConsenSys’ product philosophy. For example, the company has been enabling wider participation in ecosystem governance through <a href=\"https://consensys.net/solutions/daos-and-web3-governance/\">DAO creation and participation</a>. There currently are three DAOs – Village DAO, Education DAO, and Sandbox DAO – that are powered by ConsenSys.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, ConsenSys promotes decentralization through its products. Metamask is the first wallet to offer extensibility to users, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-metamask-flask-enables-developers-to-build-the-latest-technical-innovations-in-web3/\">Metamask Flask</a>. Flask is a proving ground for developers to roll out experimental features in Metamask. The first feature to be released through Flask was Snaps, which allows developers to expand the functionality of Metamask at runtime, without any involvement from us. Snaps is poised to accelerate the rate of innovation not just in Ethereum, but the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>MMI and its Custody Offerings</h2>\n<p>MMI’s Gnosis integration comes as part of its <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">expansion of custody solutions</a> to cater to the needs of a wide range of organizations, across different geographies and with different tech stack requirements.</p>\n<p>MMI has partnered with <a href=\"https://hextrust.com/\">Hex Trust</a> to expand its institutional-grade custody offerings into Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Asia. Its partnership with <a href=\"https://www.parfin.io/\">Parfin</a> brings its custody features to banks, exchanges, family offices and hedge funds in  Latin America. Meanwhile, MMI’s has also partnered with <a href=\"https://www.gk8.io/differentiating-factors/\">GK8</a> to bring general support for any Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer-1 networks as well as instant integrations with level-2 protocols.</p>\n<p>The latest partnerships build on MMI’s <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">previous integrations</a> with BitGo, Qredo, and Cactus Custody.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Get in Touch with MetaMask Institutional</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Important places","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2dZDTfdM1GRSDxjWBOaNMp","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Q1.2022 Review from MetaMask Institutional","slug":"q-1-2022-review-from-metamask-institutional","subtitle":"An end-of-quarter message from Johann Bornman, Product Lead of MetaMask Institutional | Q1.2022","image":{"title":"MMI-Q1-2022-Review","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=285&h=189&q=80&fm=webp 285w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=570&h=378&q=80&fm=webp 570w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=webp 1140w","sizes":"(min-width: 1140px) 1140px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=285&h=189&q=80&fm=png 285w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=570&h=378&q=80&fm=png 570w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4svJqXQkJGiKXeaBliZsMH/f86dca8ce865aa849213ac09bf33deba/MMI-Q1-2022-Review.png?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=png 1140w","sizes":"(min-width: 1140px) 1140px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1272}},"publishDate":"April 22, 2022","authors":[{"name":"Johann Bornman","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<blockquote>\n<h2>“Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come” – Victor Hugo</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hello Friends, Funds, and DAOs,</p>\n<p>As many if not most of you would know, Institutional Crypto is all-consuming. However, as my previous update denoted, my aim is to pause and provide a reflection on a quarterly basis, noting the features released and product milestones achieved within MetaMask Institutional (MMI).</p>\n<p>Since the ICO days of 2017, there has often been a continued narrative of institutions investing in what is now called Web3. Yet, institutional capital was relatively elusive for the first few years. The DeFi summer proved that this time was different, and what we have seen over the last two years is an avalanche of VC, Crypto Fund and Hedge Fund capital flooding into Web3 and DeFi. Also, we have started to see more and more traditional organisations allocating to NFTs. As the great Marc Andreessen noted, software is eating the world. Perhaps, we would add a modifier: Web3 is eating the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” – Charles Dickens</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This first quarter of this year marked another profound period—Sadly, mired in international conflict. Geopolitical uncertainty, threats of high inflation, and stagnant economic growth impacted digital assets over January and February. Yet, despite these extreme conditions, we continue to see robust institutional flows into our ecosystem. New <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/pantera-capitals-blockchain-fund-has-1b-in-commitments/\">funds are being raised</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/galaxy-digital-facilitates-goldman-sachs-s-first-otc-crypto-options-trade-830533375.html\">traditional finance is starting to invest more</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/09/24/british-museum-to-sell-nfts-of-200-hokusai-worksincluding-the-great-wave\">organisations of all stripes</a> are taking steps into Web3. From MMI’s purview, we experienced record growth across all regions in Q1 along with record assets invested into DeFi by TVL.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed” – William Gibson</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Web3 is a paradigm shift. A better way to organise society. DeFi, for example, offers capital markets that are interoperable and transparent with near-zero costs and instant settlement. NFTs are a profound way to create and store value. Underlying these products are smart contracts and ERC standards and the first principled value and philosophy of decentralisation. An idea whose time has come. Given this wave of innovation, our goal within MetaMask Institutional is to bridge every organisation on planet earth into Web3.</p>\n<p>To create a mental model, we see Web3 as the Southbank of London or the island of Manhattan—With most institutions living in Web2 on the Northbank, or other islands metaphorically speaking. In order to ferry institutional traffic from Web2 to Web3, we build more bridges (i.e. integrations with world-class custodians) to connect these two worlds. We fortify our bridges with features to serve the needs of institutional traffic (i.e. our Portfolio Dashboard, KYT risk management, and detailed reporting). We are also seeing an explosion of new organisations (DAOs) born in Web3, with similar institutional needs—And we also look to offer our bridges to these entities to connect them to the ever-increasing opportunities that DeFi provides.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“We need a product that our customers love” – Marty Cagan</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the quarter we delivered on <strong>three key initiatives</strong>; All with the aim to increase the number of bridges and fortify them with institutional features.</p>\n<h2>Unrivaled EVM access and bridging for custodial accounts</h2>\n<p>MMI—like the original non-custodial MetaMask wallet—offers its users access to DeFi and Web3 across all EMV-compatible chains. MMI differs from the original MetaMask in that it is a custodial wallet. This means that custodians and custody technology providers facilitate key storage, key management, transaction signatures, and transaction broadcasting for MMI users, in line with institutional regulations.</p>\n<p>Given that it is the custodians who broadcast the transactions—the actual EVM chain access of MMI users is determined by the chains supported by their custodian. In practice for example, if a custodian only supports transactions on the Ethereum mainnet and Polygon network, then an MMI user would be limited to transacting across these two chains. Accordingly, we rolled out our multi-chain feature that will support our custodian partners in rolling out more EVM chain access. This will give custodians the capabilities to add, sign, and broadcast any custom RPC URL specified by the user—making the rollout of new EVM chain support much easier.</p>\n<p>The ability to bridge assets is a fundamental institutional need within DeFi. This entails performing a cross-chain swap by depositing an asset into a bridge contract in one chain and then receiving minted assets on another chain. Bridging allows the ability to move assets to APY and unlocks yield farming opportunities across EVM chains.</p>\n<p>Based on the way many custodians are architected meant that MMI, historically, has connected one account to one network. This means that institutions would set up an account at a custodian and then have that account tied to a particular network, for example, Mainnet or Polygon. This one to one relationship, although providing access, prevents the bridging of assets. For assets to be bridged, the address used to deposit tokens into the bridge contract must be the same to receive the minted tokens.</p>\n<p>With our multichain feature, we removed the connection between accounts and networks historically held by custodial accounts. This means that similar to MetaMask, custodial accounts on MMI will be available across multiple networks. As our custodian partners roll out more EVM-chain support, users will automatically have access to accounts on these chains, with no additional work required from either party—allowing for the bridging of assets across chains.</p>\n<h2>Standardized custodian integration architecture</h2>\n<p>To address the different custody needs of all organisations seeking to enter the DeFi and Web3 space, MetaMask Institutional practises custodian-agnosticism. This means we work with multiple custodians that offer different custody technology stacks. It is our goal to ensure that the integration of any custodian is fast, seamless, and requires the lowest development effort possible.</p>\n<p>At the start of January, we launched our V2 JSON-RPC API Integration Architecture.</p>\n<p>This latest version allows us to compress integration steps and dramatically simplify the onboarding of new custodians by standardising our integration stack. We have also aligned the API custodians need to build with the JSON-RPC API, an open-source standard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aw5ILK0gAyyYvfJGT2CCd/89feb34616214bea720fffa375f11980/MMI-Custodian-Integration.png\" alt=\"MMI-Custodian-Integration\"></p>\n<p>While integration still requires minimal bespoke work from the MMI team, new custodians can now integrate with a standard API and client. This movement towards a “self-service” model has allowed for multiple custodians to integrate simultaneously during the last quarter.</p>\n<p>In addition, aligning our custodian API with an open-source JSON-RPC standard transforms our stack into a platform that developers can build and innovate on top of. It also aligns MMI’s architecture closely with that of MetaMask and Infura. With the JSON-RPC API, custodians could eventually write <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html\">snaps</a> for MMI and MetaMask while Infura developers can build and launch custodians and custodian services.</p>\n<h2>The Portfolio Dashboard</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png\" alt=\"MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch\"></p>\n<p>At the start of the quarter, we launched the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI Portfolio Dashboard</a>. A new canvas upon which we can build tailored institutional user experiences. We see this dashboard as another bridge and, eventually, an execution layer to Web3. The Portfolio Dashboard is a special privileged dapp. It recognises MMI wallets and then brings in all your accounts (Default, Hardware Wallet and Custodial) to provide a consolidated view of all your holdings across all EVMs. As Reid Hoffman noted, if you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. Standing on principles, our initial launch showed token holdings and historical balances across Mainnet, Polygon and BSC. A minimal viable product if you will.</p>\n<p>Over the quarter we rolled out a series of dramatic improvements to the Portfolio Dashboard. Today, we show pool balances and DeFi holdings across all EVMs with token, lending and borrowing LP, farming, leveraged farming, rewards tokens, governance, staked and yield and other positions. We also provide detailed lending and borrowing positions including APYs, APRs, health factors and interest earned and owned. Lastly, we rolled out CSV downloading of transaction history. We ended the quarter with a minimum lovable product. One that only contains a true consolidated view but offers great UX and design with minimal latency.</p>\n<p>Next, we will be rolling out detailed NFT views and LP positions, along with updating our CSV download with more granularity. We also have many features planned over the Q2 and Q3 as we build our Portfolio Dashboard into a product users can’t live without.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” – Albert Einstein</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted previously, we follow strict product and design principles within MMI, identifying what we define as tier-1 user needs. Painkillers over vitamins if you will. One of our product principles is to get outside of the building (thus many of you have been on calls with us). We thank you for your dedicated time. We follow the principles of continuous discovery and pay close attention to your voice. Our goal is to be of service and value to you and to build products and experiences that you can’t live without. This coming quarter you will see a series of features in service of your voice. Along with a few important public announcements. As we further entrench our mission of being a bridge for all organisations, while further adhering to our decentralisation values.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,\n<strong>Johann Bornman</strong></p>\n<p>Global Product Lead, MetaMask Institutional</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Important places","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"1lxnaZkOoxcl4NR1u9bxGq","node_locale":"pcm-NG","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional Launches DeFi and Web3-focused Dashboard for Organizations","slug":"metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web-3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations","subtitle":"The MMI DeFi and web3 portfolio dashboard is an expanded investor interface that provides a holistic overview of an organization’s portfolio, portfolio performance, individual assets, and historical transactions.","image":{"title":"MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=375&h=250&q=80&fm=webp 375w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=750&h=500&q=80&fm=webp 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=1500&h=1000&q=80&fm=webp 1500w","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=1500&h=1000&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=375&h=250&q=80&fm=png 375w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=750&h=500&q=80&fm=png 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png?w=1500&h=1000&q=80&fm=png 1500w","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1280}},"publishDate":"February 3, 2022","authors":[{"name":"Johann Bornman and Simran Jagdev","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Since launching in December 2020, MetaMask Institutional (MMI) has offered unrivaled access to decentralized finance (DeFi), integrated digital asset custody solutions, and unmatched pre- and post-trade compliance capabilities to cryptofunds, market makers, and trading desks.

While today, there are dashboards that cater to retail and high net worth users, and advanced portfolio management systems for institutional centralized finance traders—MMI’s dashboard has been uniquely designed to cater to organizations engaging in DeFi and web3.</p>\n<p>We accomplish this by providing a consolidated view of DeFi assets across the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, and BSC chains, with more EVMs to follow. We break down an organization’s DeFi portfolio and portray the data on one dashboard with time-weighted portfolio returns.</p>\n<p>In addition, through the Portfolio Dashboard decentralized application (dapp), the MMI team is able to create smart contracts to further expand DeFi functionalities—something impossible to do on the browser extension. So really, the launch of the dapp is only the beginning.</p>\n<p>The MMI team is building the features that organizations demand with a path to merging some of these features into the core MetaMask wallet—while the core MetaMask team continues to ensure the best decentralized experience for the broadest audience.</p>\n<h2>What is the MetaMask Institutional Portfolio Dashboard?</h2>\n<p>The Portfolio Dashboard is an expanded investor interface that provides a holistic overview of an organization’s portfolio, portfolio performance, individual assets, and historical transactions.</p>\n<p>It is accessible as a dapp with permissioned privileges for MMI’s clients, hence, it will only work with MMI wallets.
