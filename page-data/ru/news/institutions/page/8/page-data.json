Jagdev","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"simran-jagdev"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) is thrilled to announce that it has partnered with MPCVault, providing organizations of any size with the tools necessary to gain secure, efficient, and compliant access to the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).</p>\n<p>As we launch our Early Adopter Program, we are excited to see the integration of MMI and MPCVault bring benefits such as comprehensive blockchain support across 12 chains, institutional grade policy settings, programmatic access and bank-like transaction history to crypto hedge funds, venture capitalists and builders venturing into DeFi.</p>\n<p>Let us get more insight into this partnership from two key figures, Rizvi Haider, Product Manager at MetaMask Institutional, and Jason Li, Co-Founder and CEO at MPCVault, who discuss this exciting development.</p>\n<p><strong>Rizvi Haider: Jason, can you tell us why you created MPCVault, and how it stands out in the market?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jason Li:</strong> MPCVault was created to provide multi-signature crypto wallets as a service, much like an enterprise bank for traditional businesses. The major selling point is our non-custodial approach that lets users, rather than MPCVault or any other centralized party, retain complete control over their wallet keys. This is a feature increasingly sought after as centralized wallets lose credibility. The user experience of MPCVault is best-in-class and we have <a href=\"https://github.com/mpcvault/mpcvaultapis/wiki/MPCVault-API-Documentation\">robust APIs</a> our customers can build with.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What specific features or functionalities does MPCVault bring to MMI users?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault is designed to provide a versatile set of key features to help clients better manage their assets. It offers a completely self-driven platform that does not need us for operational management. Users can securely create vaults, wallets, multi-sig policies, new users, API keys, and more through user authentication without interacting with MPCVault.</p>\n<p>MPCVault supports all token types without whitelisting. If a user is minting the latest hot NFT or their own brand-new token, they can see and interact with the token in MPCVault immediately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most attractive is our bank-like transaction history. This feature tracks all your asset movements and breaks out each transaction into its parts in a consolidated view. In a DEX swap, for example, users can view both legs of the swap and the gas payment individually. Users can also add transaction notes pre- and post-transaction to provide context around the transaction across their team. All of this is, of course, exportable to excel and queryable using our API.</p>\n<p>We also provide comprehensive blockchain support, with support for <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/supported-assets\">12 blockchains</a> currently. And we are always looking to support more to align with our customer’s needs. We can support new blockchains more easily than our competitors due to early design decisions. Lastly, but probably most importantly, we have designed the product to be intuitive and reliable. Users reliably receive signing requests and our system processes requests quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What security measures does MPCVault have in place?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault’s architecture eliminates any single point of vulnerability and empowers users to secure their assets in self-custody. any consumer and custodial wallets require just one private, encrypted key to authorize transactions. However, business decisions often involve approvals from multiple parties for internal control, which is exactly what MPCVault allows.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the only wallet solution that utilizes all three major cloud platforms – AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Our multi-cloud approach further reduces the potential for compromises that could occur with a single-cloud provider. The runtime environments are secured with Trusted Execution Environments. MPCVault utilizes AMD's SEV and Intel's SGX to create an orthogonal risk profile and enhance protection for users’ assets by employing encrypted memory, ephemeral cryptography, and remote attestation. To reduce the trust base, all critical components and communications within MPCVault are end-to-end secured using public key pinning.</p>\n<p>Aside from safeguarding keys, an enterprise-facing wallet should also protect client assets in a manner that web2 antivirus software works to protect users from attacks. To that end, MPCVault’s wallet solution comes with a security layer that scans for phishing URLs, detects suspicious behaviour, checks for interacted addresses, and performs semantic analysis and transaction simulation to help users understand what transactions they are signing.</p>\n<p>Finally, MPCVault is SOC 2 Type 2 certified as a vendor for enterprise software. We also undergo regular penetration testing to proactively identify potential risks and implement mitigation measures.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: Now let’s look at how the integration between MMI and MPCVault will bring added advantages and facilitate scalability for users.</strong></p>\n<p>Aligning with MPCVault will offer our users access to an MPC provider, which provides an extensive suite of features at a <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/pricing\">competitive price point</a>. Moreover, MPCVault makes it very simple for users to get started with their free tier.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the first custodian to implement our updated integration standard that now supports broadcasting facilitated by MMI. This fundamental upgrade lets users choose and broadcast through any RPC provider, enabling them to transact on EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<p>In one of the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/unveiling-the-power-of-metamask-snaps-on-mmi/\">latest releases</a>, MMI introduced support for Snaps. With Snaps, the functionalities of the MMI extension can be further enhanced with transaction insight Snaps and notification Snaps. With MPCVault, we take the first step to enable our customers to transact on non-EVM chains. We have initiated the work with MPCVault to build a Cosmos Snap which is a much-requested non-EVM chain support that we are receiving.</p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about MMI and MPCVault’s integration? <strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Click here</a> to schedule a demo!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> is an institution-compliant version of the world’s leading web3 wallet, MetaMask.

The fact that anyone should be able to create new use cases based on blockchain is fundamental to the ethos of web3, and thereby to MetaMask Institutional (MMI). As a result, a core belief in our work is to always enable our users to innovate freely, without any constraints.</p>\n<p>To further this permissionless innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem, MetaMask launched MetaMask Snaps last month, features that extend the capabilities of the world’s most popular web3 wallet. Today, we are thrilled to announce that we are now bringing the power of Snaps to MMI.</p>\n<p>The integration of MetaMask Snaps into MMI is a significant milestone for institutions participating in decentralized finance (DeFi). MMI is a platform tailored specifically for crypto hedge funds, venture capitalists and builders, and incorporating Snaps into MMI provides them with additional security and compliance functionality when interacting with DeFi.</p>\n<h1>What are Snaps?</h1>\n<p>Snaps are features and functionalities, built by third parties, that allow users to customize their MetaMask wallet. Third-party developers can now build individual Snaps to enable specialized features that can then be installed by users directly into their MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<p>Snaps is how MetaMask aims to achieve its goal of permissionless innovation. By allowing third-party developers to create custom features and functionality in the MetaMask wallet, Snaps enables web3 to innovate at a faster rate. The first step on the journey, MetaMask Snaps Open Beta, enables users to connect to non-Ethereum blockchains, enhance security, and stay informed with notifications directly in the wallet.</p>\n<p>Snaps are currently available for everyone to try out on MetaMask Extension v11.0 and up and MMI Extension v11.4 and up (available on Chrome and Firefox). In its initial version, MetaMask Snaps Open Beta will be a curated list of available features that have undergone third-party security audits and whose code is publicly available for community review. In the future, our goal is to empower anyone to create and publish a Snap that any user can safely install.</p>\n<h1>MetaMask Snaps Now on MetaMask Institutional</h1>\n<p>The latest version of MetaMask Institutional, Extension 11.4 and up, allows users to select from a range of Transaction Insights Snaps and Notification Snaps to extend the capabilities of their MMI wallet. For instance, when executing trades on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), users can now access comprehensive data that spans from potential smart contract vulnerabilities to projected input and output amounts using transaction simulation. This enhancement substantially aids crypto hedge funds by providing an in-depth understanding of the risks involved prior to submitting the transaction for signing.\nWe are working together with custodial and non-custodial technology providers to build custom Snaps that will allow institutional users in the future to transact on non-EVM chains such as the Bitcoin or Cosmos ecosystem, whilst using the key management solution of their preference.</p>\n<h1>How to use Snaps on MMI?</h1>\n<p>Installing Snaps for the MetaMask Institutional wallet is straightforward.

Time can and should be considered a powerful ally that product teams have. Like wind within sails, it can be harnessed to create focus and urgency. It can be used for continuous discovery, learning and iteration. Within product experiences, time is also a crucial element. Reducing latency is one (of many) critical components in delighting users. Time, therefore, is ever-present.</p>\n<p>Within MMI, our focus is always to lean into this power of time. We focus on building features and products as fast as humanly possible. We focus on reducing latency to delight our users. The third quarter was mostly dedicated to this theme – a quarter where we increased the speed of our products, allowed our users to harness the power of crypto rails for payments and reduced the time (engineering hours) it takes to make our products great.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe” – Simon Sinek</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MMI’s vision is to bridge every organisation into web3. We believe web3 will have colossal influence on the world, especially finance, and we focus on providing unrivalled access to this technology. Empowering organisations to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets across three core product experiences (i) via the MMI Extension, which facilitates access to the long tail of permissionless innovation (ii) via the Portfolio Dashboard, a curated web3 read-and-write tool (iii) programmatically via our SDK and APIs. We build these experiences for our core users who are on-chain traders, inventors and builders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Move fast. Speed is one of your main advantages over large competitors.”  – Sam Altman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Growth</h1>\n<p>Despite the muted institutional on-chain activity in the last quarter, we saw meaningful assets deployed using MMI. The average monthly valuation of accounts connected to MMI increased 41.79% in Q3 compared with Q2, while our revenue increased 8% quarter-over-quarter. A trend that we are incredibly excited by is the increased on-chain activity we are seeing within Latin America. Historically, this region made up a small amount of our new onboarded organisations. However, since Q2, we have seen a meaningful increase in signed organisations. Today, some of the largest organisations in the region are using MMI to access web3.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<p>Historically, MMI was a fork of MetaMask, meaning we updated the MMI Extension with the latest changes in MetaMask. In Q3, we completed an initiative we had been working on for the last six months, of merging MMI’s codebase into MetaMask. MMI and MetaMask are now one and the same. With this merge, we rolled out a new and improved user interface (UI). MMI’s user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) will continue to change materially in the quarter ahead as we build tailored experiences for our users. The MMI Extension continues to see exceptionally high engagement and retention. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">Mixpanel’s benchmark and data</a> show average web and mobile applications average eight-week retention rates below 20%. The MMI Extension retention rates are consistently more than 3X these rates.</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<p>Our quarter was dedicated to latency and dependency. We re-architected the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, removed APIs and built new ones. We improved our user onboarding experience, reducing onboarding times six-fold. We also reduced latency across the product 16X, making the experience faster and more delightful for our users. Lastly, we rolled our Crypto Payments as the default payment method, removing dependency on traditional, inefficient, slow payment rails.</p>\n<h1>DeFi Services</h1>\n<p>Our DeFi services teams build rich data services to power the MMI Portfolio Dashboard and other Consensys experiences. Historically, we have built DeFi adapters to provide in-depth DeFi data, from valuations to profit and loss, performance, total value locked, annual percentage rate and annual percentage yield. In Q3, we moved to open-source this work to benefit the broader ecosystem. The team has focused on making the developer experience exceptional. This means any DeFi Protocol engineer can spend less than four hours building a DeFi adapter that will power the MMI portfolio dashboard (or any client that uses the open-source adapters library).</p>\n<h1>Execution</h1>\n<p>In Q3, we enabled tiered fees and withdrawals in the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\">MMI Staking marketplace</a>. We also added <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-partners-with-figment-on-institutional-staking/\">Figment to our list of partners</a> in providing staking infrastructure. The MMI marketplace now offers the most choice, the lowest fees and (we would say) the very best reporting compared to any institutional staking platform.</p>\n<h1>Q4</h1>\n<p>Our focus in Q4 will be to launch a suite of updated features. We believe reporting remains an essential and underserved need within institutional crypto. We have a range of advanced features that we will ship over the next 90 days. We will also empower our users with more APIs. Lastly, we have some exciting public announcements coming out throughout the quarter. As always, we’ll continue to focus on delighting our users by shipping the best features as fast as we possibly can.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MMI</a></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Учреждения","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2ySuwmVCggpvZH6ep4TVNp","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional | Q2 2023 Review","slug":"metamask-institutional-q-2-2023-review","subtitle":"Q2 was clearly a time for building for the ecosystem and within MetaMask Institutional it is and was no different.","image":{"title":"MMI Q1 2023 Review","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=webp 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2j2WKGVlCa9knBxdfN2aWT/adc7edf85edd8847471c00c396676c8f/Add_a_heading.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"August 4, 2023","authors":[{"name":"Johann Bornman","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“It is only perfection in the foundations that can lead to mastery of the whole”</strong> – Galina Ulanova</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GM.</p>\n<p>Volatility has been a unifying theme over the last several quarterly updates. I have reflected on volatile crypto markets, impacted by macroeconomics, geopolitics, monetary policy and market conditions. And while crypto markets were relatively robust throughout Q2, with bullish altcoin speculation in April and May, this quarter was the period of volatility in regulatory policy.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, I have also often reflected on our industry's optimism, mission-driven focus and second-to-none innovation cycles. It is also a cliche that bear markets are times to build. Hence, seeing the excitement, optimism and innovation across the ecosystem at EthCC a couple of weeks ago was not surprising. Q2 was a time for building for the ecosystem, and within MetaMask Institutional, it is and was no different.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Se tan bueno que no puedan ignorarte.\"</strong> — Cal Newport</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within MMI, our first principal focus is on providing unrivalled access across three core clients. The MMI Extension allows access to the long tail of permissionless innovation. Our Portfolio Dashboard offers a curated web3 experience, while Programmatic Access provides APIs for our users. However, we know institutional users have essential needs beyond transacting. Hence, we also focus on building experiences that empower organisations to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\"</strong> — Helen Keller</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A fantastic and exceptional partnership and announcement marked the year's second quarter. MetaMask Institutional and Fireblocks announced our joint integration. The integration brought together two prominent web3 powerhouses to provide the most complete enterprise-grade wallet security and portfolio management solution for institutional investors and builders. Over 1,800 organizations using Fireblocks will now be able to access MetaMask Institutional's (MMI) extensive suite of portfolio management solutions and leading DeFi connectivity to invest, trade, lend, and borrow on to 17,000+ dApps.

They make the product. The connections, the connections, the connections. It will in the end be these details that give the product its life.\"</strong> — Charles Eames</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within the Portfolio Dashboard, we dedicated the quarter to the foundations of the product. Looking across our architecture and APIs to dramatically improve and scale our experiences. This work lies below the surface and might not appear as a new and exciting feature. Yet, we have strict metrics and goals around the latency of our user experiences. It also means we have the highest standards for test coverage, monitoring and observability to ensure our APIs have the highest uptime. We prioritised this work in Q2 as it strengthens the foundations of our curated experience and will allow us to ship new features for our users much faster in the quarters ahead. In terms of new features, we added user management within the Portfolio Dashboard. Empowering administrators to add and delete users along with setting different user permissions. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/changelog/\">Please see our changelog</a> for updates on all the new features we ship.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3De0EAHXHhCqHEcXr6eZCw/09009f77f9abdc4f210f2571595bff48/e08959b6-f1d2-4484-b2fb-74553296cfcb.png\" alt=\"MMI Changelog\"></p>\n<p>Within our DeFi Services team, we offer detailed DeFi position views that entail valuations, claimed and unclaimed rewards details, profit, loss, and performance. We aim to provide DeFi valuation of any asset anywhere and offer an exceptional user experience with the lowest latency possible. In Q2, we expanded the range of DeFi protocols that we cover. While hardening our infrastructure. We have also conducted foundational work over the quarter and will launch a few exciting new features in Q3 of this year. Lastly, within our Web3 primitives team, we rolled out a series of improvements for our users. Namely, ensuring they always are given the lowest fee quoted by a Staking Service Provider within the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\">MMI Staking marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of growth, the number of signed organisations grew by 19.62% and the accounts they deployed by 13.70%. We are also seeing tremendously exciting growth in LATAM, with the region opening up crypto markets for users and organisations. Lastly, MMI achieved our SOC2 Type 1 certification in April. We are currently working towards SOC2 Type 2.</p>\n<p>We will ship important updates across all our core product experiences as we look ahead to the next quarter. Our users will be able to better monitor, manage, risk control, distribute and report on their web3 assets. Our focus is not only to give our users access to any asset anywhere but ensuring our product experiences are safe, secure, reliant and performant. Q3 will also be conference-heavy, with Token 2049 and Permissionless occurring during the same week in September. For any readers that will be in attendance, do come to our booths and planned events.
