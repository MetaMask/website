The fact that anyone should be able to create new use cases based on blockchain is fundamental to the ethos of web3, and thereby to MetaMask Institutional (MMI). As a result, a core belief in our work is to always enable our users to innovate freely, without any constraints.</p>\n<p>To further this permissionless innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem, MetaMask launched MetaMask Snaps last month, features that extend the capabilities of the world’s most popular web3 wallet. Today, we are thrilled to announce that we are now bringing the power of Snaps to MMI.</p>\n<p>The integration of MetaMask Snaps into MMI is a significant milestone for institutions participating in decentralized finance (DeFi). MMI is a platform tailored specifically for crypto hedge funds, venture capitalists and builders, and incorporating Snaps into MMI provides them with additional security and compliance functionality when interacting with DeFi.</p>\n<h1>What are Snaps?</h1>\n<p>Snaps are features and functionalities, built by third parties, that allow users to customize their MetaMask wallet. Third-party developers can now build individual Snaps to enable specialized features that can then be installed by users directly into their MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<p>Snaps is how MetaMask aims to achieve its goal of permissionless innovation. By allowing third-party developers to create custom features and functionality in the MetaMask wallet, Snaps enables web3 to innovate at a faster rate. The first step on the journey, MetaMask Snaps Open Beta, enables users to connect to non-Ethereum blockchains, enhance security, and stay informed with notifications directly in the wallet.</p>\n<p>Snaps are currently available for everyone to try out on MetaMask Extension v11.0 and up and MMI Extension v11.4 and up (available on Chrome and Firefox). In its initial version, MetaMask Snaps Open Beta will be a curated list of available features that have undergone third-party security audits and whose code is publicly available for community review. In the future, our goal is to empower anyone to create and publish a Snap that any user can safely install.</p>\n<h1>MetaMask Snaps Now on MetaMask Institutional</h1>\n<p>The latest version of MetaMask Institutional, Extension 11.4 and up, allows users to select from a range of Transaction Insights Snaps and Notification Snaps to extend the capabilities of their MMI wallet. For instance, when executing trades on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), users can now access comprehensive data that spans from potential smart contract vulnerabilities to projected input and output amounts using transaction simulation. This enhancement substantially aids crypto hedge funds by providing an in-depth understanding of the risks involved prior to submitting the transaction for signing.\nWe are working together with custodial and non-custodial technology providers to build custom Snaps that will allow institutional users in the future to transact on non-EVM chains such as the Bitcoin or Cosmos ecosystem, whilst using the key management solution of their preference.</p>\n<h1>How to use Snaps on MMI?</h1>\n<p>Installing Snaps for the MetaMask Institutional wallet is straightforward. Visit snaps.metamask.io and browse through dozens of Snaps. To install a Snap you can simply click on “Add to MetaMask” for the selected Snap. For all Transaction Insights Snaps you will find an additional tab on the transaction confirmation screen where you can view additional information of the associated transaction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3twWDFj7esDRvGJuFGHJaU/d32379ea182775cc860ca1dd3de1c890/Install.gif\" alt=\"MMI GIF 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//downloads.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/403D22TvQIa6olffHmWG9Z/776dd812b1c7e36a45aa0d95b5473847/action.gif\" alt=\"MMI GIF 2\"></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The integration of MetaMask Snaps into MMI is another step in our continuing journey to provide unrivaled access to web3 and DeFi to our users. By offering crypto hedge funds, venture capitalists and builders a more customizable wallet, MMI is helping to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MMI</a></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Учреждения","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"MetaMask Snaps are now available on MetaMask Institutional, offering customization to institutional DeFi.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"32U2H4N688rpwzDyh0p0LX","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional | Q3 2023 Review","slug":"metamask-institutional-or-q3-2023-review","subtitle":"MMI's efforts were firmly placed on reducing latency and expanding product speed in Q3 2023.

Time can and should be considered a powerful ally that product teams have. Like wind within sails, it can be harnessed to create focus and urgency. It can be used for continuous discovery, learning and iteration. Within product experiences, time is also a crucial element. Reducing latency is one (of many) critical components in delighting users. Time, therefore, is ever-present.</p>\n<p>Within MMI, our focus is always to lean into this power of time. We focus on building features and products as fast as humanly possible. We focus on reducing latency to delight our users. The third quarter was mostly dedicated to this theme – a quarter where we increased the speed of our products, allowed our users to harness the power of crypto rails for payments and reduced the time (engineering hours) it takes to make our products great.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe” – Simon Sinek</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MMI’s vision is to bridge every organisation into web3. We believe web3 will have colossal influence on the world, especially finance, and we focus on providing unrivalled access to this technology. Empowering organisations to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets across three core product experiences (i) via the MMI Extension, which facilitates access to the long tail of permissionless innovation (ii) via the Portfolio Dashboard, a curated web3 read-and-write tool (iii) programmatically via our SDK and APIs. We build these experiences for our core users who are on-chain traders, inventors and builders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Move fast. Speed is one of your main advantages over large competitors.”  – Sam Altman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Growth</h1>\n<p>Despite the muted institutional on-chain activity in the last quarter, we saw meaningful assets deployed using MMI. The average monthly valuation of accounts connected to MMI increased 41.79% in Q3 compared with Q2, while our revenue increased 8% quarter-over-quarter. A trend that we are incredibly excited by is the increased on-chain activity we are seeing within Latin America. Historically, this region made up a small amount of our new onboarded organisations. However, since Q2, we have seen a meaningful increase in signed organisations. Today, some of the largest organisations in the region are using MMI to access web3.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<p>Historically, MMI was a fork of MetaMask, meaning we updated the MMI Extension with the latest changes in MetaMask. In Q3, we completed an initiative we had been working on for the last six months, of merging MMI’s codebase into MetaMask. MMI and MetaMask are now one and the same. With this merge, we rolled out a new and improved user interface (UI). MMI’s user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) will continue to change materially in the quarter ahead as we build tailored experiences for our users. The MMI Extension continues to see exceptionally high engagement and retention. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">Mixpanel’s benchmark and data</a> show average web and mobile applications average eight-week retention rates below 20%. The MMI Extension retention rates are consistently more than 3X these rates.</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<p>Our quarter was dedicated to latency and dependency. We re-architected the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, removed APIs and built new ones. We improved our user onboarding experience, reducing onboarding times six-fold. We also reduced latency across the product 16X, making the experience faster and more delightful for our users. Lastly, we rolled our Crypto Payments as the default payment method, removing dependency on traditional, inefficient, slow payment rails.</p>\n<h1>DeFi Services</h1>\n<p>Our DeFi services teams build rich data services to power the MMI Portfolio Dashboard and other Consensys experiences. Historically, we have built DeFi adapters to provide in-depth DeFi data, from valuations to profit and loss, performance, total value locked, annual percentage rate and annual percentage yield. In Q3, we moved to open-source this work to benefit the broader ecosystem. The team has focused on making the developer experience exceptional. This means any DeFi Protocol engineer can spend less than four hours building a DeFi adapter that will power the MMI portfolio dashboard (or any client that uses the open-source adapters library).</p>\n<h1>Execution</h1>\n<p>In Q3, we enabled tiered fees and withdrawals in the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\">MMI Staking marketplace</a>. We also added <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-partners-with-figment-on-institutional-staking/\">Figment to our list of partners</a> in providing staking infrastructure. The MMI marketplace now offers the most choice, the lowest fees and (we would say) the very best reporting compared to any institutional staking platform.</p>\n<h1>Q4</h1>\n<p>Our focus in Q4 will be to launch a suite of updated features.

I have reflected on volatile crypto markets, impacted by macroeconomics, geopolitics, monetary policy and market conditions. And while crypto markets were relatively robust throughout Q2, with bullish altcoin speculation in April and May, this quarter was the period of volatility in regulatory policy.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, I have also often reflected on our industry's optimism, mission-driven focus and second-to-none innovation cycles. It is also a cliche that bear markets are times to build. Hence, seeing the excitement, optimism and innovation across the ecosystem at EthCC a couple of weeks ago was not surprising. Q2 was a time for building for the ecosystem, and within MetaMask Institutional, it is and was no different.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Se tan bueno que no puedan ignorarte.\"</strong> — Cal Newport</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within MMI, our first principal focus is on providing unrivalled access across three core clients. The MMI Extension allows access to the long tail of permissionless innovation. Our Portfolio Dashboard offers a curated web3 experience, while Programmatic Access provides APIs for our users. However, we know institutional users have essential needs beyond transacting. Hence, we also focus on building experiences that empower organisations to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\"</strong> — Helen Keller</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A fantastic and exceptional partnership and announcement marked the year's second quarter. MetaMask Institutional and Fireblocks announced our joint integration. The integration brought together two prominent web3 powerhouses to provide the most complete enterprise-grade wallet security and portfolio management solution for institutional investors and builders. Over 1,800 organizations using Fireblocks will now be able to access MetaMask Institutional's (MMI) extensive suite of portfolio management solutions and leading DeFi connectivity to invest, trade, lend, and borrow on to 17,000+ dApps.

Looking across our architecture and APIs to dramatically improve and scale our experiences. This work lies below the surface and might not appear as a new and exciting feature. Yet, we have strict metrics and goals around the latency of our user experiences. It also means we have the highest standards for test coverage, monitoring and observability to ensure our APIs have the highest uptime. We prioritised this work in Q2 as it strengthens the foundations of our curated experience and will allow us to ship new features for our users much faster in the quarters ahead. In terms of new features, we added user management within the Portfolio Dashboard. Empowering administrators to add and delete users along with setting different user permissions. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/changelog/\">Please see our changelog</a> for updates on all the new features we ship.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3De0EAHXHhCqHEcXr6eZCw/09009f77f9abdc4f210f2571595bff48/e08959b6-f1d2-4484-b2fb-74553296cfcb.png\" alt=\"MMI Changelog\"></p>\n<p>Within our DeFi Services team, we offer detailed DeFi position views that entail valuations, claimed and unclaimed rewards details, profit, loss, and performance. We aim to provide DeFi valuation of any asset anywhere and offer an exceptional user experience with the lowest latency possible. In Q2, we expanded the range of DeFi protocols that we cover. While hardening our infrastructure. We have also conducted foundational work over the quarter and will launch a few exciting new features in Q3 of this year. Lastly, within our Web3 primitives team, we rolled out a series of improvements for our users. Namely, ensuring they always are given the lowest fee quoted by a Staking Service Provider within the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\">MMI Staking marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of growth, the number of signed organisations grew by 19.62% and the accounts they deployed by 13.70%. We are also seeing tremendously exciting growth in LATAM, with the region opening up crypto markets for users and organisations. Lastly, MMI achieved our SOC2 Type 1 certification in April. We are currently working towards SOC2 Type 2.</p>\n<p>We will ship important updates across all our core product experiences as we look ahead to the next quarter. Our users will be able to better monitor, manage, risk control, distribute and report on their web3 assets. Our focus is not only to give our users access to any asset anywhere but ensuring our product experiences are safe, secure, reliant and performant. Q3 will also be conference-heavy, with Token 2049 and Permissionless occurring during the same week in September. For any readers that will be in attendance, do come to our booths and planned events.

This partnership will expand MMI’s institutional staking marketplace, which launched in March 2023.</p>\n<p>The addition of Figment to MMI’s staking marketplace brings MMI’s offering to five aggregated institutional staking providers, alongside Consensys Staking, and three others. With this decentralized approach, MMI offers institutions the choice among the industry's top tier providers, together with standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting, and a simplified staking experience. MMI’s institutional staking marketplace brings a unique and enhanced staking experience to all kinds of organizations seeking to engage in Web3.</p>\n<p>Before we dive deeper into the Figment-MMI partnership, let’s recap why staking is crucial for Ethereum, and how institutions stake.</p>\n<h2>Institutions and Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking was a core component of Ethereum’s move to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, away from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, in September last year.</p>\n<p>Staking entails depositing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toghrulmaharram/status/1530708903440302082\">32 ETH</a> to activate another validator, or node, to the network. These validators play a crucial role in achieving consensus by proposing new blocks, and verifying and attesting to the validity of other proposed blocks. As the number of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md\">honest validators</a> increases, the cost of attacking the network rises, significantly enhancing Ethereum's economic security.</p>\n<p>Ethereum’s upgrade to PoS brought numerous advantages, enhancing settlement <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#finality\">finality</a> guarantees, enabling <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/\">sharding</a>, and significantly reducing <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/\">ETH issuance</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/\">energy usage</a>. From the standpoint of an Ethereum user, this transition also opened up a fresh avenue for earning additional token rewards through <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#:~:text=Further%20reading-,What%20is%20staking%3F,new%20ETH%20in%20the%20process\">staking</a>.</p>\n<p>Staking can be an integral part of an institution’s digital asset strategy, especially since the Shanghai/Capella upgrade earlier this year. This upgrade enabled withdrawals of the ETH that had been locked on Ethereum’s consensus layer since December 2020, when staking was first enabled on the Beacon chain.</p>\n<p>However, the nuances and complexity of institutional staking can deter companies looking to participate. Choosing the right vendor for institutional staking can be complicated due to the differences in the fees charged, slashing coverage, infrastructure, terms and conditions,  and reporting standards. In addition, various staking providers offer different benefits to institutions, ranging from differences in infrastructure (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client) to certifications (SOC2 Type 2 and ISO 27001).</p>\n<p>Institutions often want to select their node locations too. This can help them comply with the regulations of the jurisdiction their nodes are in, and ensure the network is decentralized by choosing diverse node locations, among other things.</p>\n<p>MMI’s institutional staking marketplace is aimed at streamlining this complex staking experience for institutions and leveling the playing field by bringing together best-in-class partners to provide institutions with a simple one-click staking experience.</p>\n<h2>MMI Staking Marketplace</h2>\n<p>MMI’s staking marketplace provides access to top-tier staking providers; offers standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting; and a simplified staking experience—to facilitate broader institutional web3 participation.</p>\n<p>Institutions often require multiple custodial integrations to engage in web3, depending on their regulatory requirements, and security and privacy needs. It also means institutions are bound by the provider their custodian has chosen. However, MetaMask Institutional today <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">is integrated</a> with 12 custody and self-custody platforms globally. This allows institutions seamless and unrivaled access to staking providers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">MMI</a>, the web3 wallet for organizations developed by Consensys, and the first multi-custodial institutional web3 offering on the market, is excited to include <a href=\"http://figment.io\">Figment</a> in our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">institutional staking marketplace</a>.</p>\n<h2>Figment and MMI</h2>\n<p>Figment is the leading provider of staking infrastructure with over $3B in total assets staked. On Ethereum, Figment is the largest non-custodial staking provider with almost 5% of staked ETH on Figment validators. It provides the most comprehensive staking solution for over 250 institutional clients, including asset managers, exchanges, wallets, foundations, custodians, and large token holders, to earn rewards on their digital assets. These clients rely on Figment’s institutional staking service, including rapid API development, rewards reporting, partner integrations, and slashing protection.</p>\n<p>Figment is backed by industry experts, financial institutions, and our global team across twenty-three countries.
