Bornman","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h3><em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em></h3>\n<p>Moore's Law, Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns, Wright's Law, and Gilder's Law all point to rapidly increasing technology and innovation cycles. In the world of crypto, we add the principles of permissionless innovation, open-source technology, and <a href=\"https://www.christenseninstitute.org/interdependence-modularity/\">modularity theory</a> (to name only a few), resulting in innovation cycles that are arguably second to none. These tides, currents and waves come to mind as I reflect on the first quarter of the year.</p>\n<p>In a recent conversation with a famous VC and crypto fund, they expressed their amazement at how quickly exuberant valuations had returned and how ebullient the ecosystem was from a mere quarter ago. \"We are so back\" was an often observed phrase across the ecosystem in Q1. As a perfect testament to this acceleration, memecoins have undergone a \"tik-tok'ifcation\" this cycle, compressing into lasting only a few days, hours or even minutes. Yet <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/hedge-funds-lured-by-returns-of-memecoins-like-dogwifhat-wif?embedded-checkout=true\">attracting seasoned investors who need and want to participate</a>.</p>\n<p>It's not surprising that this abundance of innovation presents remarkable opportunities. Given tokenomics and values and principles that rebuke inflationary assets (in distribution, not in price), being early in crypto can be rewarding. This is why, since the Cambrian explosion started during the DeFi summer, organisations have needed and wanted access. First slowly, then all at once, each cycle draws more adoption from consumers and institutions alike. Hence, organisations don't just need access; they need unrivalled access.</p>\n<p>At MetaMask Institutional, our core belief is centred around this concept of unrivalled access. We are convinced that organisations, regardless of their structure or location, will need to engage with the new internet, web3, through various product experiences. This could be at the forefront of web3 innovation, a curated interface, or programmatically.</p>\n<p>At MMI, we adhere to stringent product principles that guide us in creating experiences from zero to one and from one to many. Our first principles revolve around providing unrivalled web3 access and empowering institutions to oversee, manage, control, and report on their web3 assets, regardless of their required interface. These principles drive the three value streams we have established: the MMI Extension, which enables secure access to the long tail of permissionless innovation within web3; the Portfolio Dashboard, a curated web3 read-and-write institutional experience; and our SDK and APIs for unrivalled programmatic access. With these products and first principles, we shape our product strategies to address the most critical user needs (tier-1) for our users. Our strategies encompass many areas, from creating delightful user experiences and seamless control to unrivalled reporting on any asset, anywhere.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on Q1, perhaps one strategy perfectly summarises our focus to solve the fundamental user need for unrivalled access: \"Any asset, anywhere\". To stand in accord with the rapid innovation within the ecosystem, Q1 was a prodigious quarter for the MMI team.</p>\n<h1>Growth</h1>\n<h3><em>“Much effort, much prosperity.”— Euripedes</em></h3>\n<p>In Q2, MMI grew 70.83% quarter-over-quarter with newly signed and activated organisations. This growth was driven by 81.82% in North America and Europe, 88.89% in APAC and MENA and 59.17% in LATAM.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<h3><em>“The value is in what gets used, not in what gets built”. – Kris Gale</em></h3>\n<p>The MMI extension provides connectivity to all of web3, most notably the frontier of web3. In Q1 2024, our strategy was focused on delighting our users with improved user experience. Our goal is to give users access to the long tail of permissionless innovation with an experience that offers enterprise-grade security and stability.  Our goal has been to build a valuable product for our users as measured by engagement and retention. The MMI extension has an 8-week retention rate of 63.68% and a weekly over-monthly transacting user engagement ratio of 0.616. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">Mixpanel’s benchmark data</a> shows that the average retention rates of web and mobile applications are eight weeks below 20%. At the same time, Sequoia Capital <a href=\"https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/selecting-the-right-user-metric-de95015aa38\">indicates just how high our engagement metric is</a>.</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<h3><em>“I want it all and I want it now” — Queen</em></h3>\n<p>A product principle within our team is to spend time with our users daily. From these sessions, we have consistently heard a repeating pain point. That no product in the market today shows them everything. Given the fast innovation cycles in new Layer 1 and Layer 2’s across EVM and Non-EVM networks, users are still required to track and report on their positions manually. Accordingly, our Q1 strategy was focused on any asset anywhere, layering in different initiatives and epics to empower users to consolidate all their holdings. Within our tactics, we first shipped account management within the Portfolio Dashboard, focusing on offering a delightful user experience. Firstly, we automatically detect any accounts any user in an organisation has transacted with and then automatically add it to their organisation. Secondly, if we detect a new account in the MMI extension that is not already part of an organisation, we ask the user if they would like to add any of these accounts to their organisation. Lastly, users can now enter any account for their organisation by navigating to the Accounts section in the portfolio dashboard. Any EVM accounts added to an organisation will be shown within the transaction history view. We show the transaction history from the inception of an address. Lastly, any accounts added to an organisation will be snapshot daily, providing detailed validation statements. Our strategy here is to offer seamless control.</p>\n<p>Our next tactic was to integrate Solana support, a process that now allows users to add a Solana account with just a few clicks. Solana accounts and tokens are seamlessly integrated into the Assets section of the Portfolio Dashboard and added to Snapshots. Our last tactic focused on implementing support for Centralised Exchange data. With our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/your-cefi-data-and-positions-now-available-on-metamask-institutional-in/\">Mesh integration</a>, we launched with support for Coinbase Prime and will soon add more Prime and Institutional account support. Users can now connect their prime accounts, view their token balances within the Portfolio Dashboard, and get snapshot valuations of all their on-chain and off-chain holdings.</p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to build a curated, institutional product that our users can’t live without. We measure the value we provide through engagement and retention metrics. Our 8-week retention for the portfolio dashboard since inception is 49.63%, more than double the average for mobile and web applications. This success is a testament to our shared vision and the value we deliver to our users.</p>\n<h1>DeFi open source adapter</h1>\n<h3><em>“Thunderbolts and lightning” — Queen</em></h3>\n<p>As permissionless innovation has expanded the depth and breadth of DeFi protocols, our users have increasingly needed accurate DeFi data. Over the last two years, we have spent 10,000 hours in the DeFi data trenches, building simulators to simulate closing positions and the value of the underlying tokens, and speaking with the consumers and producers of DeFi data. From this, we have consistently heard the same repeating challenges. Namely, users who need accurate DeFi positions and those with DeFi protocols who need and want users to interact with their protocols. In conjunction with this race for data in a world of permissionless innovation, we also found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DeFi protocols were not being connected with users at scale</li>\n<li>There is no standard for both read and write DeFi access</li>\n<li>Few scaled approaches benefit the wider ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, we set out to build a DeFi adapter standard that is focused on achieving the following goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a standardised adapter implementation specification for both read and write data. We want to enable any protocol engineer to build an adapter in less than four hours.</li>\n<li>Provide rich and in-depth DeFi data. We resolve an LP token into the underlying token exposure to value a position. We also offer proper time-weighted profit &#x26; loss (P&#x26;L) and return data, therefore accounting for inflows and outflows, claimed and unclaimed rewards to arrive at the correct P&#x26;L and performance position.</li>\n<li>Benefit the wider ecosystem. We want to create an open-source standard that benefits consumers of the data, drives users to DeFi protocols and allows anyone to fork and use the repository.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This work ties in with our strategies of any asset anywhere and unrivalled programmatic access, and we delight our users with industry-leading rich and in-depth data.

Over the last two years, we have built out its capabilities and functionality to offer rich DeFi data, profit and loss, transaction history, and portfolio valuations through snapshots and account management. We built primitives like swaps and a staking marketplace. This all contributes to our goal, which is to create a product that offers unrivalled web3 access and allows an organisation to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets. Today, the product has an average 8-week retention of 49.63% and an average 4-week retention of 51.10%. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">The average web application has an 8-week retention of 23%.</a></p>\n<p>In our quest to build a product our users can’t live without, our product principles and values ensure that we spend time with our users daily to understand their product needs. One user need we have heard consistently is that no product they use or have seen can truly show them everything. Users can obtain views of their positions across EVMs but must do manual work to reconcile non-EVM allocations and Centralised Exchange data. Therefore, building a truly holistic portfolio requires many hours of manual work. To address this problem, we launched support for Solana last quarter. In Q2 and Q3, we will continue to add additional non-EVM support.

This initiative is poised to significantly enhance operational efficiency, data accuracy, and reporting capabilities for institutional users.</p>\n<h1>Understanding the Challenges</h1>\n<p>For institutional on-chain investors, much of their investment is directed towards DeFi opportunities. This makes access to detailed, reliable DeFi data critical to their operational success. Currently, institutional users are required to integrate with a variety of third-party APIs to obtain a comprehensive and accurate assessment of their portfolio's performance, as well as for effective monitoring and reporting. This reliance on multiple third-party APIs can lead to issues with data discrepancies, increased operational complexity, and challenges in data reconciliation. Additionally, those allocating capital to long-tail DeFi protocols frequently face challenges with unreliable or absent data, further complicating investment decisions and risk management.</p>\n<h1>Bridging the Gap with APIs and DeFi Adapters</h1>\n<p>Recognizing the necessity for a standardized, reliable means of accessing DeFi data, MMI has developed robust tools designed to empower users with comprehensive portfolio management, monitoring, and reporting:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>API Offerings</strong>: MMI’s suite of APIs includes Snapshots and Transaction History APIs, and DeFi read and Write APIs. These tools are designed to create real-time portfolio dashboards, improve data indexing for efficient retrieval, and provide precise P&#x26;L and performance data on DeFi positions</li>\n<li><strong>DeFi Adapters</strong>: MMI’s open-source DeFi adapter standard represents a breakthrough in data acquisition and protocol interaction. They serve as connectors between MMI dashboards and various DeFi protocols, simplifying data access and enhancing information reliability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These tools aim to cater to MMI users’ essential needs: obtaining deep insights into their DeFi investments to make informed, strategic decisions for portfolio management. By reducing dependence on external data providers and offering a scalable, in-house solution, MMI is set to significantly enhance user experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Metamask Institutional delivers so much value to our fund's operations. Tools like their Snapshots, Defi Adapters, multichain support and Snaps really helped us to concentrate many of our needs into a single reliable partner. Having APIs to access these services has made these operations even simpler.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gean, Honey Island Capital</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Accurate P&#x26;L and Performance Data with DeFi Read API</h1>\n<p>The success of our open-source DeFi adapter standard enables us to extend our range of adapters, providing users with accurate DeFi data across an expanded array of protocols. Notably, our DeFi Read API is powered by our DeFi adapters, offering capabilities beyond the Snapshots and Transaction History API by providing detailed profit and loss (P&#x26;L), and performance analytics. Our adapters boast richer data content, with coverage currently extending to approximately 27 protocols.</p>\n<p>Through our open-source DeFi adapter standard, protocols can independently develop adapters, enabling MMI and MetaMask users to access protocol-specific data. With the increasing adoption of our open-source library, we foresee a future whereby any new protocol will immediately build an adapter next to integrating with MetaMask, hence ensuring availability of data upon launch of the protocol.

Since the advent of yield farming kicked off the DeFi summer, we have seen an explosion of innovation that is second to none. DeFi has rebuilt the financial system from first principles. It offers basic primitives for swapping, lending, borrowing, saving, investing, options and derivatives in a transparent, interoperable, permissionless way. DeFi democratises access to these primitives for anyone, anywhere.</p>\n<p>In the traditional world, one might think of these tools as simple building blocks. DeFi takes it a step further, creating complex strategies like self-repaying loans, recursive yield strategies, the yield farming of airdrops and the ability to connect all these primitives seamlessly to achieve the highest reward rate possible. This level of innovation is generating interest from professional traders and institutions, who are stepping into on-chain in a meaningful manner for the first time.</p>\n<p>DeFi, therefore, can and has profoundly and positively impacted the world. However, navigating this complex world becomes difficult, especially when it comes to access toDeFi data. Users can stake into a decentralised exchange (DEX) to receive yield and rewards and an LP token to reflect their position. They can then lock that LP token into a vesting contract to boost their reward rate further and receive a Locked or Vested LP token. These staking, re-staking and recursive loops are common due to the interoperable nature of DeFi and can result in token exposure and claimed and unclaimed rewards several layers deep. In the world of institutions, having accurate valuations of these positions and rewards is profoundly crucial. Net Asset Values (NAV) and performance are tied to accurate marked-to-market valuations and the ability to make precise decisions based on profit, loss, and performance.</p>\n<p>Today, the challenges related to DeFi data are being solved by several players in the market, most notably through the indexing of data and tagging, labelling and categorising different smart contracts. This allows a data provider to determine the balance of a position in a pool and show the underlying token balances of a position. Despite these efforts, there is a constant race with cutting-edge users (like professional traders and DeFi Funds) to stay updated with the latest protocols.</p>\n<p>At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we have been deeply involved with solving these data challenges. We have a user-centric culture and our product principles denote that we speak with users every day. Over the last two years, we have spent 10,000 hours in the DeFi data trenches:first building with sub-graphs; then building simulators to simulate closing position and the value of the underlying tokens; and lastly, speaking with the consumers and producers of DeFi data. Namely users who need accurate DeFi positions, and with DeFi protocols that need and want users to interact with their protocols. In conjunction with this race for data in a world of permissionless innovation, we also found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DeFi protocols were not being connected with users at scale</li>\n<li>There is no standard for both read and write DeFi access</li>\n<li>Few scaled approaches benefit the wider ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, we set out to build a DeFi adapter standard that is focused on achieving the following goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provide a standardised adapter implementation specification for both read and write data.</strong> We want to enable any protocol engineer to build an adapter in less than four hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide Rich and in-depth DeFi data.</strong> We resolve an LP token into the underlying token exposure to value a position. We also offer proper time-weighted profit &#x26; loss (P&#x26;L) and return data, therefore accounting for inflows and outflows, claimed and unclaimed rewards to arrive at the correct P&#x26;L and performance position.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit the wider ecosystem</strong>. We want to create an open-source standard that benefits consumers of the data, drives users to DeFi protocols and allows anyone to fork and use the repository.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What Are MMI's DeFi Adapters?</h1>\n<p>The simplest way to think of our DeFi adapters (aptly named) is to think of DeFi as a new on-chain world with its own electricity, which is DeFi data. Our adapters are literally (and metaphorically) equivalent to adapter plugs that can take this DeFi electricity (on-chain DeFi data) and convert it into DeFi views in an easily understandable user interface. The best example of the output of this data can be found in the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, where we show rich DeFi views of the underlying token exposure.</p>\n<p>We also show P&#x26;L and performance using accurate time-weighted return calculations. This means we account for the value of a position today, the deposits (inflows) and withdrawals (outflows), and both claimed and unclaimed rewards to determine the accurate return and performance of a position over the last day, seven days and one month. The DeFi adapters will also power MetaMask Portfolio in showing DeFi data to users.</p>\n<p>We have created this standard and repository to make the DeFi adapter building as seamless as possible. When a DeFi protocol is built and adopted, its LP tokens are immediately shown in the MMI Portfolio Dashboard,  followed by MetaMask portfolio. This ensures LP tokens and positions are visible to institutions and consumers and gives a DeFi protocol broad access to the most extensive user base in crypto. Users, therefore, benefit from seeing their position, and DeFi protocols benefit from users being able to interact with accurate data.</p>\n<p>Our eventual goal is to make the adapters a standard on par with MetaMask wallet support, ensuring depth and breadth, and long-tail access to any DeFi protocol. This means we foresee a future where as soon as a DeFi protocol is created, it will immediately add support for MetaMask and build an adapter so that MMI and MetaMask users can access the DeFi protocol and also have their LP tokens shown across MetaMask and MMI user experiences. This helps us to avoid having to race our users to provide data in cutting-edge protocols, as wallet access and LP tokens support will be there since inception.</p>\n<h1>Developer Experience</h1>\n<p>With our user-centric product principles, we have built a repository with several features to empower developers to build and consume DeFi adapters. Our explicit goal is to allow any protocol engineer to spend a maximum of four engineering hours to build a new DeFi adapter.</p>\n<p>We have also created communication channels to support engineers in creating adapters. We have a seamless command line interface (CLI) that guides developers through the primitive they are building and offers existing templates that provide most of the required code. Once an adapter is built, we offer a UI for developers to review and quality assure their output. We also offer a video tutorial and an FAQ section to guide through the process and make the developer experience as simple and seamless as possible.</p>\n<p>On the consumer side of the DeFi data, besides the open-source repository, we currently offer a DeFi API with all the necessary endpoints to value positions and get profits and performance. We also offer a write endpoint to seamlessly generate transaction parameters for a wide range of DeFi protocols, therefore offering programmatic trading. Lastly, we provide a DeFi SDK with automated prompted methods for each supported protocol to empower developers to build further with our adapters.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about MMI’s DeFi API, read <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-apis-for-institutions/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>Our goal is to scale the DeFi protocols that we support over the next two quarters. Our goal within MMI is to offer unrivalled access to any asset anywhere and empower institutions to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets.
