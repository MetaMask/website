MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet that grants you full ownership over your private key and ultimately, control over your assets.</li>\n<li><strong>Large token selection:</strong> Because it gathers data from a DEX, MetaMask Swaps allows you to access a large number of cryptocurrencies that may not be available on a centralized exchange, giving you more flexibility and choice when it comes to your investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z-SJV4ugHU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n<h3>Swap in one place</h3>\n<br>\n<p>Whether you choose to use Swaps in the desktop/mobile wallet, or dapp, it's super convenient and straightforward, drastically reduces the number of steps needed, and the amount of exposure to third-party smart contracts.

It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need. I don’t need to be run by a bank. I own my keys. I love [MetaMask] security and communication.”</p>\n<p>A strong preference for self-custody is a sentiment we feel will be adopted by more people. This is the silver lining during the recent insolvency of big CeFi players: more people are asking important questions and taking a closer look at the security of their assets to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>Where does one start with their self-custody journey? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1590121718009380867\">Education</a>. Whether you’re an artist, DeFi dabbler, or tech veteran—you can download MetaMask, the wallet that gives you the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=event-recap-miami_content\">freedom to exit</a> anytime, for any reason.</p>\n<p>We closed our conversations out on a fun note, asking each artist to describe the future of NFTs in three words:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7vjwSRJmknuLCpNEQZ1Zr4/4f8fd1ef6025bfe6605c3df6f424ba33/frases.gif?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"3 words only \"></p>\n<p>MetaMask’s inaugural Artist Potluck in Miami hearkened back to ages of old when brilliant minds would come together over dinner and drinks, and talk about their art and what inspires them. Only this time, the medium was enhanced with blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all the artists who showed up and continue sharing their creations with the world. This community wouldn’t be the same without you. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Izzyalright\">Faith Love</a> for hosting and curating such an electric evening.

Simply click the “Portfolio site” link in your Extension’s home screen to get started, or head on over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?utm_source=&#x26;utm_medium=&#x26;utm_campaign=metamask-bridges_announcement\">portfolio.metamask.io</a> in your MetaMask Mobile in-app browser.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzpRJzKtRSE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Increased bridging activity over the past year has led to multiple bridge solutions to accommodate users hopping across chains. While this introduced a slew of routes, it also added a layer of uncertainty around which one to pick. Now, MetaMask curates this for you and takes the extra guesswork out of the equation.</p>\n<p>Instead of having to find multiple bridges, you can just use MetaMask Bridges to source the best route depending on where you want to go and what you want to bring with you.</p>\n<p>This beta version currently supports 1:1 bridging of up to $10,000 per transfer of <strong>ETH/WETH, common stablecoins (eg: DAI), and native gas tokens (eg: MATIC)</strong> across these EVM networks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Avalanche</li>\n<li>Binance Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bridge providers are integrated in two layers: <strong>bridge aggregators</strong> and <strong>individual bridges</strong>.</p>\n<p>We integrate directly with two bridge aggregators: <a href=\"https://socket.tech/\">Socket</a> and <a href=\"https://li.fi/\">LI.FI</a>. These partners allow us to easily search routes from several bridges, as well as provide helpful utilities for a better user experience.

All in one window, and all in MetaMask Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=metamask-bridges_announcement\">Download MetaMask here.</a></p>\n<p>You just select your desired starting network <em>(where you’re bridging FROM)</em>, destination network <em>(where you’re bridging TO)</em>, and the token you want to port over for a list of bridging options. You can then use the <strong>recommended route</strong> we present to you or compare all the routes we found by price and time estimates.</p>\n<p>This beta period will include zero MetaMask fees and we are exploring support for more EVM networks like Arbitrum and Optimism along with additional tokens in the future.</p>\n<h3>Prioritizing Security</h3>\n<p>Just like you wouldn’t board an airplane that hasn’t been thoroughly inspected, you also wouldn’t want to move money across an unsafe bridge.</p>\n<p>This past year—falling short of many a crypto enthusiast’s <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-l222-means-for-the-ethereum-ecosystem/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=metamask-bridges_announcement\">L222</a> expectations—has been rife with bridge exploits. Your crypto needs a secure way to travel. The security question is always, “How can the other side be convinced in a secure way to release the correct token amount to the correct person?” and we take that into consideration every time we select a bridge aggregator and individual bridges.</p>\n<p>Our team is committed to <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/your-crypto-needs-a-secure-way-to-travel-heres-why/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=metamask-bridges_announcement\">deeply understanding the evolving bridging space</a> to provide the most secure experience possible so you feel confident when using MetaMask Bridges.</p>\n<h3>Facilitating A Delightful Journey</h3>\n<p>Using MetaMask Portfolio not only allows you to view all your assets in one place, it’s a single dapp experience to bridge across commonly-frequented chains.</p>\n<p>While connecting to the dapp only works for MetaMask users <em>(downloading MetaMask is <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=metamask-bridges_announcement\">easy, free, and open to all</a>)</em>, non-MetaMask users can still utilize Portfolio View by using the “watch any account” feature.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Bridges aims to facilitate a smooth transition when you hop from one chain to another. The experience is frictionless, intuitive, and convenient. You don’t have to leave the dapp to get from Ethereum to Binance, you can hop over and view all your assets in the same place.

These partners allow us to easily search routes from several bridges, as well as provide helpful utilities for a better user experience.</p>\n<p>Through Socket and LI.FI, we support a curated set of individual bridges: <a href=\"https://www.connext.network/\">Connext</a>, <a href=\"https://hop.exchange/\">Hop</a>, <a href=\"https://cbridge.celer.network/\">Celer cBridge</a>, and <a href=\"https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/\">Polygon Bridge</a>. We did extensive research to vet these bridges, with the goal of developing an objective framework to select those that met our high bar for security and decentralization. We’re not being paid by any of these bridges to be part of this product (though we may have other partnerships with them) and have selected them purely based on our evaluation of their design.</p>\n<h3>How We Picked These Bridges</h3>\n<p>Here’s our framework for deciding which third-party bridges to integrate. All bridging involves some level of risk, and we’ve done our best to find the most decentralized and usable bridges out there. Here’s what we looked for:</p>\n<p><strong>Network and token support</strong></p>\n<p>Usability is super important to us, so we looked for bridges that support MetaMask’s most-used networks and tokens. This meant providing robust support for native tokens and canonical stablecoins across Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and Avalanche.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust minimized design</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in bridging is how information is validated. When a user deposits tokens on one network, how does the bridge know for sure that this has occurred, so it can send them tokens on another network? Different bridges have different mechanisms to do this, and they differ significantly in their trust assumptions.</p>\n<p>We considered bridges in the following categories, with these criteria for each:</p>\n<p><strong>Atomic swap:</strong> We consider this model to be highly trust minimized, as it relies on contract code rather than external parties.</p>\n<p><strong>Canonical:</strong> This is the native bridge of a given destination network, such as the Polygon Bridge for the Polygon network. We include these bridges because we consider the trust assumptions to be comparable to the network itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimistic:</strong> In this model, each transfer goes through a challenge period during which challengers can report fraud. In general, we like this model because only one honest party is required to maintain the integrity of the bridge. However, trust assumptions may vary depending on whether the challenger set is permissioned (i.e. a limited set of parties can challenge) vs permissionless (anyone can challenge).</p>\n<p><strong>External validator:</strong> In this model, a threshold number of third-party validators attest that each transfer is valid. This is the most common model for bridge validation, and bridges in this category may be risky if the  validator set is not large enough. We may consider external validator bridges if validator addresses are public and a high threshold is required for validation.</p>\n<p><strong>Reliable and vetted</strong></p>\n<p>We like to see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recent and regular audits of the deployed contract code</li>\n<li>Battle testing with time/volume on mainnets</li>\n<li>High liquidity and reliability</li>\n<li>Robust handling of failure cases</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bridges we selected</h3>\n<p>Here are the bridges that we are integrating for our initial launch, and how we categorized them based on the framework above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Polygon Bridge - canonical</li>\n<li>Connext NXTP - atomic swap</li>\n<li>Hop Exchange - optimistic (uses canonical L2 bridges)</li>\n<li>Celer cBridge - external validator / optimistic hybrid</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We’ve scoped this to a short list for our initial launch but are continuing to evaluate other bridges and consider them for integration. We’re also actively monitoring the bridges we’ve selected, and will continue to analyze their security as they evolve.</p>\n<p>If you’re building a bridge that you think would meet our criteria, <a href=\"https://forms.gle/fZ46yea1Xok5Z9cE9\">please reach out</a> and let us know!</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this article and helped evaluate bridges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our partners Socket and LI.FI who shared their own frameworks for these bridges and worked with us to integrate them.</li>\n<li>The teams at Connext, Hop, Celer, and many others, who met with us and answered our numerous questions about their bridge.</li>\n<li>ConsenSys researchers who contributed to this framework: Dominik Schmid, Peter Robinson, Ermyas Abebe, and many others who supported along the way.</li>\n</ul>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Последние","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/ru/news/page/16/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/security/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":60,"categoryId":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","category":"","totalItems":69,"currentPage":16,"totalPages":18,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"не поддерживается.
