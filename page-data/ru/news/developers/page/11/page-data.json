consistently seek new ways to increase user engagement, democratize decision-making, and gain valuable insights from the people who use the apps they build on-chain. One method to collect user feedback is to integrate a  feedback or survey form into dapps. Feedback forms bridge the communication gap between users and developers and provide real-time feedback at scale to improve applications. They also foster an environment of active participation and collective decision-making.</p>\n<p>From Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) employing feedback forms for on-chain governance, to businesses leveraging them to gauge employee sentiment, the utility of feedback forms is infinite.</p>\n<p>This blog provides a step-by-step tutorial to integrate a feedback form into your application backend and start collecting user feedback. For this, we will use a feedback form we built in-house using the MetaMask SDK and other Consensys tools called, Form xChange.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/pFaNvxTSN7V4XX1EUsc6g/f0d4056dc33dcfd5f850c28bf3ce9e89/image3.png\" alt=\"image3\">\n<em><a href=\"http://form-x-change.vercel.app\">Form xChange</a></em></p>\n<p>Whether you're looking to improve your dapp’s UX, collect post-conference feedback, or a DAO member aiming to democratize decision-making, this tutorial will show you how to integrate a feedback form and open a new channel of communication within your application.</p>\n<h3>What is Form xChange and how does it work?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ConsenSys/Form-XChange\">Form xChange</a> is an open-sourced tool, developed for the creation and utilization of feedback forms on the blockchain. While the smart contract for Form xChange is currently deployed on <a href=\"http://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, its adaptable architecture allows for deployment on any EVM-compatible network.</p>\n<p>The platform enables participants to cast anonymous votes on the proposals incorporated within these forms and provides both participants and form creators access to view the results, reflecting the transparency ethos of web3.</p>\n<p>Form xChange utilizes a user-friendly interface built with Next.js and operates using two smart contracts, both written in Solidity: the <strong>FeedbackForm</strong> contract and the <strong>FeedbackFormFactory</strong> contract. The process is straightforward—every time a new form is created, a new FeedbackForm contract is deployed, a task handled efficiently by the FeedbackFormFactory contract.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5sXAlyRmpNTTZvcVyx2kf6/f80225e34395661e84b225fa8d5c8fdd/image1.png\" alt=\"image1\"></p>\n<p>To utilize Form xChange, users must first connect and sign into the application using their MetaMask wallet. Some of the supported roles and responsibilities are:</p>\n<p><strong>Form Author</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to create new forms containing multiple questions for feedback collection.</li>\n<li>Ability to view an average score derived from user responses to each section post-feedback collection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Participant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to submit responses to forms or proposals while preserving anonymity.</li>\n<li>Access to view the results post-response submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Integrate a feedback form into your dapp for user feedback at scale</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Users with less sophisticated use cases can simply rely on the already <a href=\"https://form-x-change.vercel.app/\">deployed instance</a> of Form xChange but if you have a unique use case and would like to host your own instance or control what the user interface looks like, then this part of the blog is for you.</p>\n<p>We’ll go through how to clone the repository to your local machine and get the backend running, we’ll deploy a new instance of the Form  xChange backend to Linea and finally, we’ll touch on the MetaMask SDK and how it makes it easy to connect users' MetaMask wallet clients from any platform.</p>\n<p>We’ll not be building out a user interface as it is beyond the scope of this tutorial but feel free to check out this <a href=\"https://github.com/ConsenSys/Form-XChange/tree/a63a3f482157d4d8325d1ca64852486a808086f1/apps/web\">repository</a> to get an idea of how you can approach building out your own user interface.</p>\n<h3>How to clone the Form xChange backend</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>This section assumes that you have node.js v16 or above installed on your computer, as well as the <a href=\"https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/\">Truffle development environment</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Clone the repository:\n<code>git clone git@github.com:ConsenSys/Form-XChange.git</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the contract directory:\n<code>cd Form-XChange/packages/form-XChange</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compile contract:\n<code>truffle compile</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run test:\n<code>truffle test</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to deploy your own instance of the Form xChange backend to Linea</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>What is Linea and why deploy on Linea? Well, <a href=\"https://docs.linea.build/users\">Linea</a> is a type 2 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) that replicates the Ethereum environment as a rollup, allowing developers to build on it with the experience and security of Ethereum but with lower transaction costs.</p>\n<p>Linea offers advantages like faster finality, compatibility with all development tools, default integration with MetaMask, and high throughput among other things, which makes it an excellent choice for deploying Form xChange backend.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand what Linea is and why it is a great choice, let's delve into how one can deploy to Linea. To follow through with this section, ensure you have the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet extension</a> installed as well as some Linea Eth. See <a href=\"https://docs.linea.build/users/move-funds/fund#linea-sepolia\">documentation</a> for more information on how to get some Linea Eth.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Run the Truffle dashboard: <code>truffle dashboard</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head to <code>localhost:24012</code> in your browser and connect your MetaMask wallet, then select Linea from the networks dropdown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run <code>truffle migrate --network dashboard</code> in a separate terminal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head back to <code>localhost:24012</code> and click confirm on the prompt asking you to confirm the deployment.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it, you should see the newly deployed contract address on the terminal window you ran the <code>truffle migrate --network dashboard command</code>. You can verify successful deployment by visiting the <a href=\"https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/\">Linea block explorer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Use MetaMask SDK to seamlessly connect your dapp to users’ wallets</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>With the Form XChange backend deployed to Linea, we want to make sure that users are not faced with any difficulties when they interact with our dapps. In other words, we want to make it seamless for users to connect their wallet client to our dapp without any hassle.</p>\n<p>MetaMask presents the most effective method to connect to any dapp deployed on Linea, as the MetaMask wallet extension now includes a Linea network option by default. Furthermore, to simplify the process for developers to add MetaMask support to their dapps, MetaMask recently released the MetaMask <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">SDK</a> that can be used with JavaScript, Mobile and Gaming platforms.</p>\n<p>To use the MetaMask SDK in your React frontend code base, here are some steps you can follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the MetaMask SDK using Yarn or NPM:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>yarn add @metamask/sdk or npm install @metamask sdk</code></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Import the MetaMask SDK into your React project:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>import { MetaMaskSDK } from '@metamask/sdk';</code></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Instantiate the MetaMask SDK using these options</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code> const sdk = new MetaMaskSDK(options);\n sdk.getProvider(); \n\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Access the MetaMask SDK anywhere in your React codebase:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts', params: [] });</code></p>\n<p>Calling <code>eth_requestAccounts</code> using <code>ethereum.request()</code> prompts the installation or connection popup to appear so it is advisable to always call this function first.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">MetaMask SDK documentation</a> for more information on how you can use the MetaMask SDK with Node.js, IOS, Unity and more.</p>\n<p>Form xChange enhances your dapp by facilitating valuable feedback collection and promoting increased user input and participatory decision-making.

More and more apps are using offchain resources (such as computation or data storage) verified in the contract logic due to blockchains technical limitations. Examples include order books, merkle trees of airdrops, sorted lists, token attributes etc.</p>\n<p>In each case valuable information is stored/computed off chain but can be used and has big effects on onchain interactions. To make this possible, contracts use different cryptographic techniques such as hashes or signatures to check validity. Dapps then require frontends/apis with specific logic that can come up with the relevant information for the contract. Sadly this pattern breaks composability, e.g a DeFi app relying on a proprietary order book served on AWS can’t be easily integrated by another smart contract.</p>\n<p>Fed up by those limitations we decided to come up with a standard and infrastructure to enable all apps to be easily integrated into anything. We strongly believe that making integrations easier again are opening many opportunities to the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n<p>The Composooor metamask snap is used to standardize and handle communication between a web client, one or multiple offchain arbitrary ressources, and an arbitrary number of smart-contracts implementing the composooor standard. All standard ressources are easily accessible on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@composooor/composooor\">an npm package</a> that makes using composooor’s superpowers a one liner in most cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Step by step</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When preparing a transaction, our metamask snap wallet will request an estimate gas call on the desired on chain contract.</li>\n<li>If the contract needs some data or computation made off chain to function, it will revert with a standardized error containing specs on how to find this missing data. The standardized error looks like this</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>error MissingOffchainDataError(\n    address registryAddress,\n    string url,\n    bytes abiArgs\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>this error is exposed by the <code>ComposooorRegister</code> that contracts must extend to access offchain ressouces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Metamask snap wallet can then decode this error and finds the missing data either by fetching it on a decentralized protocol, or on an API, or by executing some code it fetched from this sources to produce it. For the ETHDenver hackathon, we implemented the simplest option which is the API call.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>const responseData = await fetch(error.url + `?args=${error.abiArgs}`);\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The wallet will then estimate gas again, this time adding an instruction to store the fetched data in the standardized registry of the corresponding contract before calling the desired method.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>const callToRegisterData: Call = {\n    callee: error.registryAddress,\n    functionSelector: utils.id('recordParameter(bytes)').slice(0, 10) as PrefixedBy0x,\n    data: defaultAbiCoder.encode(['bytes'], [data]) as PrefixedBy0x,\n};\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>During the transaction execution, the same or another contract may need another off chain ressource to function. If it’s the case, the wallet loops on the transaction preparation steps until no offchain ressource is needed anymore. This enables endless composability <em>between protocols</em> accessing rich offchain ressources.</li>\n<li>When the gas estimation is successful, the user is prompted with the signature of the prepared transaction, to execute successfully with all necessary ressources included.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What integrating a composooor-enabled app / making your own looks like.</strong></p>\n<p>At ETHDenver we showed how composooor reduces code complexity of the usual hybrid app pattern by at least 80-90%.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart contract side</strong></p>\n<p>Import with import \"<code>@composooor/ComposooorRegister.sol</code>\";.\nExample usage :</p>\n<pre><code>contract Example is ComposooorRegister {\n    function action() public {\n        bytes memory data = consumeParameter(\"http://api.api/number\", abi.encode(arguments));\n        (uint256 offchainNumber) = abi.decode(data, (uint256));\n        (...)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ComposooorRegister</code> is made with solidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Front end side</strong></p>\n<p>The composooor snap yields the most returns on the front-end side: it reduces typically 200+ lines integrations to… 0 ! The snap logic handles everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo</strong></p>\n<p>We made a fully integrated demo in the form of a react-wagmi dapp. This dapp makes it possible to buy an NFT paying only a small fraction of the price upfront and taking a loan to repay later to finance the rest. Onchain, it is no less than 8 contracts which are involved in the transaction. In the middle of it, the NFT marketplace requires an offchain signature of the NFT seller. The composooor snap is able to pick up the error, decode it and provide the information onchain (after being fetched in an api) despite the complexity of the transaction. Composooor made this app way simpler to implement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5hvC8qYY3yAs7nSHVrACLr/77c690ce30608a5b893cf05e954c9dfc/Screenshot_2023-06-26_at_9.49.45_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-26 at 9.49.45 PM\"></p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>Part of such an innovation making developers gain considerable time and enabling new blockchain usecases is adoption. We would implement and deploy multiple user-facing apps using Composooor snap behind the scenes and working with the corresponding snap. If those apps gain traction, we would make some partnerships to compose them with other apps starting a flywheel of adoption fueled by the simplified dev experience. Along the way the snap and the standard would evolve into a more general and standardized product fitting the original vision: connecting blockchains synchronously to arbitrary resources, in an agnostic way regarding decentralization and usecases.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re a team building a lending protocol to use NFTs as collateral with a more capital efficient approach.  We decided to go with an architecture using off-chain components like an order book. This choice allows to improve capital efficiency and user experience but may limit interoperability with other protocols. This is why we developed the Composooor snap allowing easy integration with other protocols. We hope that this library will be used by other teams, opening new possibilities and making their work easier.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Wallets are one of the main unavoidable pillars/building blocks of web3 and  MetaMask is the defacto default wallet for most users. Enabling developers to leverage this for arbitrary new use cases seems crucial to me. The main point is that we can’t imagine or prepare for all innovations wallets will need to be a part of so giving some access to them is like the transition from bitcoin to ethereum: enable arbitrary use cases on top of your tech has unforeseen exponentially compounding upside. So its hard to answer this question but what I’m most excited about is apps making the wallet do more than just signing messages and optimizes the interactions is a context-rich way for the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Make use of the template provided and be careful to correctly ask for every user approval needed and use as few as possible.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

Decoding methods and arguments is a good first step, but if users interact with a malicious contract, the visible information can be misleading. To counterbalance this, I thought about showing quantitative data, in a very simple manner, using code colors 🟥 🟧 🟩. The idea is to show a trust score based on data that is easy to verify from multiple sources. I chose to start with 4 criterias:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many users have interacted with the smart-contract overall.</li>\n<li>How often the current account has interacted with this contract.</li>\n<li>How old this contract is.</li>\n<li>Has this contract code been verified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<h4>The insights main function</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The snap is very simple, and is easy to extend. Here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/Tbaut/template-snap-monorepo\">code</a> that we will go through.</p>\n<p>When the insights tab is clicked on MetaMask, the <code>onTransaction</code> function is called. Inide it, we call each function diving us the criteria that we decided to take into account.</p>\n<pre><code>type ScoreResult = {\n  score: number;\n  description: string;\n};\n\nconst onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({\n  transaction,\n  chainId,\n}) => {\n  // call all the insights criteria\n  // they all return a ScoreResult\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those functions generally call an api, and process the results. Let’s dig into one of these to understand.</p>\n<h4>Determine a trust score based on overall interactions</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Let’s dig in the function giving a score based on the total amount of transaction that a contract received. We use the Etherscan api here, but any other api could work to verify the same data.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Gets a trust score for a contract based on the overall tx count\n * 3 -> the contract had overall >=100 txs\n * 2 -> the contract had overall 50 &#x3C;= tx &#x3C; 99\n * 1 -> the contract had overall tx &#x3C; 50\n *\n *@param options0\n * @param options0.chainId - the chain id to call the api with\n * @param options0.contractAddress - the contract address to check\n * @returns the score and a description\n */\nexport async function getContractTransactionCountScore({\n  chainId,\n  contractAddress,\n}: IContractTransactionCountScore): Promise&#x3C;ScoreResult> {\n  // get the api url asking for the 100th transaction\n  // it will return undefined if there is none\n  const url100 = getEtherscanContractTxsUrl({\n    txNumber: 100,\n    chainId,\n    contractAddress,\n  });\n  const { result: result100 } = await fetchUrl&#x3C;EtherscanResponse>(url100);\n\n  // if there is a 100th tx it means the contract\n  // has received at least 100 txs. We have all we need\n  // we can return with the best score of 3\n  if (result100.length === 1) {\n    return {\n      score: 3,\n      description: 'more than 100 txs',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // this will be call if there are less than 100 txs\n  // we check if there is a 50th tx.\n  const url50 = getEtherscanContractTxsUrl({\n    txNumber: 50,\n    chainId,\n    contractAddress,\n  });\n  const { result: result50 } = await fetchUrl&#x3C;EtherscanResponse>(url50);\n\n  // if there is a 50th tx we can return with a score of 2\n  if (result50.length === 1) {\n    return {\n      score: 2,\n      description: 'more than 50 txs',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // otherwise, return with the lowest score\n  return {\n    score: 1,\n    description: 'fewer than 50 txs',\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Not all scores are equal</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Now that we have a <code>TrustResult</code> for each of our criteria, it is time to apply weights. Indeed, not all of our criterias trust score should have the same weight. For instance, the amount of past transactions with the contract has a cost. If a scammer was willing to game it, it would cost them some ETH for gas. As a result, this criteria is considered more costly to game, hence more important, I gave it a weight of 3.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the contract’s age cannot be circunvented by an attacker, they would have to deploy it, and then wait before launching their attack if they wanted to have a high trust score. I gave it a weight of 2.</p>\n<p>The other criterias are considered weaker and have a weight of 1.</p>\n<pre><code>// arbitrary weight for each score\nconst Weights = {\n  contractTransactionCountScore: 3,\n  contractAgeScore: 2,\n  contractVerificationScore: 1,\n  contractUserTransactionScore: 1,\n};\n\n// calculate the overall trust score after applying the weights\nconst calculateOverallScoreWithWeight = ({\n  contractTransactionCountScore,\n  contractUserTransactionScore,\n  contractAgeScore,\n  contractVerificationScore,\n}: CalculateOverallScoreWithWeightArgs) => {\n  const totalWeitght = Object.values(Weights).reduce(\n    (acc: number, curr: number) => acc + curr,\n    0,\n  );\n\n  const overallScoreWithWeight =\n    (contractUserTransactionScore.score * Weights.contractUserTransactionScore +\n      contractTransactionCountScore.score *\n        Weights.contractTransactionCountScore +\n      contractAgeScore.score * Weights.contractAgeScore +\n      contractVerificationScore.score * Weights.contractVerificationScore) /\n    totalWeitght;\n\n  return Math.floor(overallScoreWithWeight);\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Present the final score</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Finally, we now have the trust score of a smart contract, we need to show it in a simple manner. The MetaMask insights api only allows to show key value pairs. The keys are in bold, and the values have a reglar font weight. I figured that by using emojis, I could create an interface that is not intimidating to users, while still showing all the information gathered.</p>\n<p>The function transforming the trust score into emojis:</p>\n<pre><code>const getColor = (result: number) => {\n  switch (result) {\n    case 3:\n      return '🟩';\n    case 2:\n      return '🟧';\n    default:\n      return '🟥';\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the return part of the <code>onTransaction</code> function, with some hacks to show key values, in a nice way:</p>\n<pre><code>return {\n    insights: {\n      '': `Trust score: ${getColor(overallScore)}`,\n      ' ': '-----------------------------',\n      'Contract popularity': `${getColor(\n        contractTransactionCountScore.score,\n      )} ${contractTransactionCountScore.description}`,\n      'Previous interactions': `${getColor(\n        contractUserTransactionScore.score,\n      )} ${contractUserTransactionScore.description}`,\n      'Contract age': `${getColor(contractAgeScore.score)} ${\n        contractAgeScore.description\n      }`,\n      'Contract verification': `${getColor(contractVerificationScore.score)} ${\n        contractVerificationScore.description\n      }`,\n    },\n  };\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, I created a very simple interface to call 2 types of contracts, one very well known and used Uniswap contract, and one very recently deployed storage contract, the one presented by default on Remix. I you were to use this snap and interract with the <a href=\"https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45\">Uniswap router contract</a> you would see the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/aTUNnd3NE3KYsfkMIxEsE/6f79c40caed890a21e87de6a529f0e31/Screenshot_2023-05-25_at_6.24.47_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 6.24.47 PM\"></p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>This is only scratching the surface of what information could give user confidence, or prevent them from being phished. The obvious first step would be to use more sources for our data. The contract verification already use Sourcify and Etherscan, but it would be better to use multiple sources for each criteria.</p>\n<p>Then, we should apply more advanced algorithm to prevent scammers from being able to game the scores easiely. For instance, we should count the amount of unique accounts who transacted with a contract. We could do some anaysis on the accounts that interacted with it in the past as well, to make sure they are not all originating from one source. The down-side is that all this analysis is harder to make using multiple sources of truth.</p>\n<p>There are some interesting research as well done on scam detection for smart contract that could be integrated. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07220.pdf\">More info here</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, the overwelming amount of positive reactions I received for this hack shows that users are demending for some more information, and I believe that the fact that it is easy to digest played a key role.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>I am a software engineer at ChainSafe and I worked at Parity in the past. I love to build products with a focus on good UX. Web3 is a great playground for me because everything is so complex, trying to make it understandable to as many ppl as possible is a great challenge. I have been in the space for almost 5 years and although I have attended many hackathons, I am generally a volonteer, a mentor or a judge rather than a hacker. The main reason is that I am a perfectionist and generally don’t like quick and dirty solutions :).</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, my colleagues at ChainSafe have built one of the first ever snap, the one for Filecoin. I probably had a look at the code back then, but did not dig further.</p>\n<p>At the time of hacking, the insights api wasn’t actually available to developers. I was talking to the MetaMask team in Lisbon, I did not expect to be able to add a user interface to MetaMask. They told me that it was about to be released, and that I could build on it now. In fact this was only available with a custom build, and the documentation hadn’t been released yet.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>Having the ability to add custom code in a tab, while making sure that this code is safe to execute opens the doors to a huge range of enhancements. I’m very much looking forward to what will come out of this.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you?</strong></p>\n<p>The template monorepo made it a breath to get started. The fact that all my code could be written in one repo, with one command to launch both the test dapp and the snap, both with auto-refresh was a great developer experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What does Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s the extension to an extension. No product can fit all users. Adding this composable layer is a great opportunity for anyone asking for some feature to build it themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ll talk about the insights in particular that is unlocking infinite customability depending on the needs. I bet that many more safety related insights will be developped in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Clone the monorepo, and enjoy a very quick start.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Multi-resolver Snap</h3>\n<br /> \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-MF76pOw1Y\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver\">https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build multi-resolver snap?</strong></p>\n<p>The user experience in web3 has long been overlooked. One area in which we see progress is account abstraction. It feels like there is a new naming service almost every week. The goal of these is to simplify the way we interact with each other in this space: names are more recognizable than wallet addresses and therefore build a base layer for identity and reputation systems.</p>\n<p>Additionally, original (naming) standards can benefit the popularity of projects. For example, let us call a project “x”. The new naming standard this project proposes could be called x-domains or x-names. Success in the project would automatically help grow the naming service, while success in the naming service would do the same for the project - a win-win. Now, we are left with a fragmented picture of the namespace. Sure, there are people that try to use every naming service, which results in a race around names in the limited namespace we have in some (domain-based) naming services. Other naming services use more familiar handles, like emails, phone numbers, or more general social handles (Twitter username, IG handle) that people already possess, to eliminate potential markets around these identities.\nMost people end up with one, maybe two handles from different naming services. Because of the variety of choices, developers need to integrate multiple naming service resolvers into their applications.</p>\n<p>When a new naming service takes over a sizable percentage of the market, it should also be integrated into one’s application as to not exclude users of that naming service. From the user’s perspective, searching for alternative applications with similar functionality that also support the naming service of their choice is annoying. Why not let people use whatever they are familiar with AND provide a solution that helps developers focus on creating the best application possible?</p>\n<p>The Multi-resolver Snap does exactly that.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<h4>The gist</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The snap was built for <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/discussions/821#top\">MetaMask Flask 10.20</a>. The current version uses the permissions <code>endowment:network-access</code> and <code>snap_confirm</code>. The first is used in a <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver\">preliminary version</a> to request resolved addresses and translate Twitter IDs to Twitter usernames. The latter shows a confirmation screen to the user highlighting the resulting address before a transaction is created.</p>\n<p>Currently supported resolvers are IDriss and ENS. The Snap runs on localhost.</p>\n<h4>Integration from dApp side</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>For a developer to integrate this Snap, and therefore all available resolvers, one must connect to a wallet and the snap first:</p>\n<pre><code>const connectSnap = async (\n  snapId: string = defaultSnapOrigin,\n  params: Record&#x3C;'version' | string, unknown> = {},\n) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_enable',\n    params: [\n      {\n        wallet_snap: {\n          [snapId]: {\n            ...params,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Invoking happens through the method <code>resolve_send</code> and can be called through:</p>\n<pre><code>const resolveInput = async (id_?: string) => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'resolve_send',\n        identifier: id_,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>which returns the resolved address. Here, <code>id_</code> is the identifier that the user inputs into a sending field.</p>\n<p>Using the new <code>multiChainProvider</code>, connecting to the snap is as simple as connecting to the wallet with the required permissions:</p>\n<pre><code>import { MultiChainProvider } from \"@metamask/multichain-provider\";\n\nconst provider = new MultiChainProvider();\nconst { approval } = await provider.connect({\n  requiredNamespaces: {\n    eip155: {\n      chains: [chains],\n      methods: [\n        permissions\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n});\nconst session = await approval();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above-mentioned <code>resolve_send</code> method can be renamed to <code>eth_sendTransaction</code>, allowing apps to use the Multi-resolver Snap without needing to change any integrations. Whenever <code>eth_sendTransaction</code> is called, the Snap is interposed and resolves the input before creating the transaction. Applications should allow for inputs of type <code>String</code> instead of throwing an error whenever an user input does not match an address. The snap then takes care of the rest!</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>As a next step, this snap will be taken open-source to encourage other developers to hunt for bugs, improve the code, and even add their custom resolvers. Open-sourcing will unlock the true potential of this Snap: not a single developer or entity has to integrate all emerging naming services. A <code>contribute.md</code> file promotes this process. Additionally, further development from the MetaMask Snaps team will be tracked.</p>\n<p>Precisely, two specific things greatly benefit this snap:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>endowment:transaction-insight</code> permission for account-to-account transfers to remove the additional <code>snap_confirm</code> call before a transaction is triggered, and</li>\n<li>UI injections into MetaMask. The goal is to implement the snap into the sending field so users can utilize the multi-resolver without connecting to a website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, a complete integration with the <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/ts-library\">IDriss resolver</a> is sought. Full integration allows users to send crypto and NFTs to any email, phone number, and Twitter username without needing to be registered in the IDriss book.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/53ZvMx1js90Dskut5ygAm/dd6ca6050e755c22388b24edd1ea0eec/Screenshot_2023-05-24_at_9.37.23_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-24 at 9.37.23 AM\"></p>\n<p>My name is Lennard, and I have been interested in the blockchain space since 2017. For over a year, I have been building and co-founding <a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/\">IDriss</a>, a decentralized mapping of emails, phone numbers, and Twitter usernames to wallet addresses. More generally, I focus on building tools toward a more usable web3, which motivated me to build this snap.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>The Snaps team is very present at conferences this year (2022) , so I have been running into them a couple of times now. The first time I interacted with the code base was after one of their presentations at EthCC 2022 in Paris. While the features were still limited, the documentation was already promising, and I am very hopeful for the future of MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I have not seen a similar approach to including outside contributors in the development of wallets yet. While some other wallets have open-sourced their code, Snaps enable developers to expand the functionality of MetaMask directly. I am sure this approach will be adopted by other projects as well, as it can be better maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a great opportunity to build this snap during a hackathon. Having the MetaMask Snaps team around helped whenever questions came up. One thing that is still missing is the ability to customize MetaMask’s UI. Additionally, some dependency issues are hard to debug, which takes over most of the development time.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Snaps provide a playground for developers to integrate their projects or ideas directly into MetaMask in a permissionless way. For me, this means that the growth of any project can be accelerated, as users can suddenly enjoy more benefits using the tools (wallets) they already own.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Snaps can help prevent scams through transaction insights, create a more network-inclusive experience with keyrings, and allow for a more user-friendly web3 experience using custom resolvers paired with UI enhancements. Together, this will bring more people into the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Go to hackathons!
