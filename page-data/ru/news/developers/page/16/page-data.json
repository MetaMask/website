MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Web3Auth Snap</h3>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5oGyrgLzemC1JiaiuulAT/1148481c0dfb050066a088eba536cfbe/demo.gif?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"demo\"></p>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/\">https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>At Web3Auth, we’ve always believed that multi-factor authentication is the best way to secure crypto assets, and is much better than seed phrases. When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed MetaMask Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private key.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads / interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The rest of the process can be further split into two major tasks:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Getting the MPC SDKs running in the MetaMask Snaps SES environment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re familiar with how MetaMask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the MetaMask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers / byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the MetaMask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library / specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private keys.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows MetaMask Snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>I think MetaMask Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting overall.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through MetaMask Snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to Web3.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>In general, I think MetaMask Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for MetaMask Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping MetaMask Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

The process is time consuming as each approval needs to be addressed individually and manually confirmed. While this approach is secure it requires a lot of continuous, manual user interaction.</p>\n<p>This is what pointed us towards an unaddressed niche where we could leverage the MetaMask Snaps capabilities, to make things better.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>We decided to leverage the following benefits of MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to all accounts in Metamask</li>\n<li>Ability to perform complex operations using a single approval from a user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To propose a solution for this problem, which in the future should make it possible to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present only one user prompt to get access to all current and future accounts (with notable exception of hardware wallets)</li>\n<li>Revoke all approvals from all current accounts in batch, with no need for separate confirmations and accounts switching</li>\n<li>Actively monitor all user accounts (including those on hardware wallets) for new approvals and display notification to the user when detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On installing the Revoke Snap through the web UI, MetaMask will prompt for needed permissions.</p>\n<p>All permissions are specified in a <code>snap.manifest.json</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\"initialPermissions\": {\n    \"snap_confirm\": {},\n    \"snap_getBip44Entropy_60\": {},\n    \"snap_notify\": {},\n    \"endowment:long-running\": {}\n  },\n</code></pre>\n<p>Two permissions worth noting here are:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Control your “Ethereum” accounts and assets.</strong>\nThis means that to function, our snap requires users parent key (secret key) from MetaMask in order to be able to generate accounts and sign transactions on behalf of the user.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Run indefinitely</strong>\nWhile Revoke Snap is not an implementation that is meant to run in the background continuously, settling transactions on blockchain takes time and MetaMask Snaps do have a built in kill-switch after 60s, which can not be enough to finalize the transactions. This permission allows RevokeSnap to go around that security measure.</p>\n<p>After receiving the necessary permissions RevokeSnap will generate a number of accounts out of the user's private key:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n// Get chosen amount of wallets (signers) from provider (in this case Metamask)\nexport async function getSigners(provider: ethers.providers.Provider, amount: number): Promise&#x3C;Wallet[]> {\n    let wallets: Wallet[] = [];\n\n    for (let i=0; i&#x3C;amount; i++) {\n        wallets.push(await getSigner(provider, i));\n    }\n\n    return wallets;\n}\n\n// Exctract addresses out of wallets\nexport function getAddresses(wallets: Wallet[]): string[] {\n    let addresses: string[] = [];\n\n    for (let i=0; i&#x3C;wallets.length; i++) {\n        addresses.push(wallets[i].address);\n    }\n\n    return addresses;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n// Fetch parent key from Metamask and generate a wallet from it, base on the input index\nexport async function getSigner(provider: ethers.providers.Provider, index: number): Promise&#x3C;Wallet> {\n    // Metamask uses default HD derivation path\n    // https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/importing-a-seed-phrase-from-another-wallet-software-derivation-path/\n    const ethereumNode = (await wallet.request({\n      method: 'snap_getBip44Entropy_60',\n    })) as unknown as BIP44CoinTypeNode;\n    const deriveEthereumAccount = await getBIP44AddressKeyDeriver(ethereumNode);\n    // A bug:\n    // The current public version of @metamask/key-tree's derive function returns the private key and chain code in a single buffer\n    // Ether.js also accepts a 64 byte buffer without errors and returns wrong keys\n    // Related issue: https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/2926\n    // TODO(ritave): Update to newest key-tree when available and use deriveEthereumAccount(0).privateKey\n    const mainAccountKey = (await deriveEthereumAccount(index)).privateKey;\n    return new Wallet(mainAccountKey, provider);\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then perform a check for leftover approvals and, once the search is complete, expose a button to revoke all identified approvals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4eMGL5OTIo5lvvahzoJzBO/2edd3473ae0f0d836b33cd7f4ff97288/Screen_Shot_2022-11-07_at_3.54.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 3.54.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>On the click of the “Revoke All” button the Snap will issue a series of transactions corresponding to the leftover approval to zero them out one by one. As the Snap already is in possession of the generated wallets private keys this does not require any additional confirmation from the user, beyond the initial one.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>As during the hackathon there was only a limited amount of time to create the most optimum solutions, we utilized a number of functional implementations which have room for improvement.</p>\n<p>For starters, currently the number of accounts generated in the snap is passed as a function parameter and hard-coded as 3. A better option could be for the snap to use an external API (or a dedicated backend) to verify the next transaction nonce on each account for a given chosen chain(s) and only take into account addresses with the nonce number greater than 0.</p>\n<p>Moreover for approvals we used a short list of known addresses of tokens and actors to showcase the functionality, but optimally the approval check should be done more globally. This could be done, i.e. by using an RPC provider API (such as <a href=\"https://infura.io/\">Infura</a>) to find all approval transactions and parse them to display on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m Jedi, I work as a Lead Developer at Swix. I have been in crypto since 2017, and since 2019 I fell down the rabbit hole and started working with DeFi protocols, mostly on the Smart Contract side. With Swix I’m currently working on bridging the real estate yields on-chain and bringing new users into the crypto space.</p>\n<p>I’m Adrian, I’ve worked as a software developer and architect for small startups and big companies. Blockchain has been my main area of interest for many years, particularly the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>During the development of the Revoke Snap we split the work so that Jedi focused on working out how MetaMask Snaps work and setting up necessary basics for the Smart Contact interactions required within our Snap, while Adrian handled the web UI and bundling of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>We were first introduced to MetaMask Snaps during ETHWarsaw’s presentation, which was quite technical and encompassed more in-depth under the hood workings of the protocol. This triggered us to research the topic some more, and well, here we are.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I mean… the idea itself. MetaMask Snaps breaks out of the standard accepted within the non-custodial browser wallet extensions landscape which is that every transaction, while interacting with web3 applications, needs to be individually approved by the user. Also the functionality of wallets is limited to the functionality the team behind it decides to implement.</p>\n<p>What MetaMask Snaps brings to the table is a platform enabling the bottom-up creation of native wallet integrations for arbitrary blockchain interactions, which carries a lot of resemblance to the mobile app stores.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space? What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest value adds for the crypto space coming from MetaMask Snaps is smoothing of the UX in the crypto and DeFi protocols. Whether that would be enabling bundling transactions, 1-click approval for all transactions made within one dApp, allowing for direct contract interactions while executing credit card-to-crypto purchases or some other even more creative solution, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>It is our strong belief that, especially for the new crypto users, abstracting away the complexity and clunkiness of blockchain interactions can be a game changer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>A big motivator while building Revoke Snap was that MetaMask Snaps are still in development and thus the experimentation we do right now can have a tangible impact on where MetaMask, MetaMask Snaps and, through it to an extent, the crypto space will go. It was a good experience to be able to add our brick to the future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>For any devs looking to try MetaMask Snaps out — have a go at it. MetaMask Snaps are pretty straight forward to start with using the available github template repository and the MetaMask team is very helpful as well. The concept itself has a big potential and there isn’t so much that has been done with it already, so it’s easy to provide a value add.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

On the other hand, integrating with MetaMask Snaps could help onboard an existing population of web3 users to Aleph Zero network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Adapter</strong></p>\n<p>Our snap is composed from two parts. First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the snap is a server and the website is the client. To reflect this natural boundary we have extracted snap API to a separate package named <code>adapter</code>. It exposes all possible methods the website may use to interact with the snap. Such a layer of abstraction, ease usage of the Snap by other clients (websites). Our API can be described by four methods, which names are pretty self-explanatory. If u want to deep dive, here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">code</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const getAccountFromSeed = async (seed: string): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccountFromSeed\", [seed]);\n}\n\nexport const generateNewAccount = async (): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"generateNewAccount\", []);\n}\n\nexport const signTransaction = async (transaction: SignerPayloadJSON): Promise&#x3C;{ signature: string }> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"signTransaction\", [transaction as unknown as string]);\n}\n\nexport const getAccounts = async (): Promise&#x3C;string[]> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccounts\", []);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The app</strong></p>\n<p>So, we explained the glue between our layers, let’s move on to the first layer - website. We have forked the official browser based <a href=\"https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/apps\">polkadot app</a>. Then we had to replace core functionalites like signing transactions, creating accounts or recovering them, from browser based wallet to the Snap based. For example to sign transactions inside MetaMask we changed implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/blob/ed9f12e54c9c721685692f75b78e2f3e1d8b546b/polkadot-apps/packages/react-signer/src/signers/QrSigner.ts#L20\">QrSigner</a> to use Snap <code>signTransaction</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Integrating MetaMask Snap with the polkadot app introduced two improvments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, it allowed to inherit the security model from the MetaMask extension instead of using the polkadot app wallet, which is based on local storage.</li>\n<li>Secondly, we could use MetaMask seed to create a polkadot app in a deterministic way, so whenever we export our seed, the Aleph Zero key will be also exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The MetaMask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides API calls, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user. In this case we have levarged two of them:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MeteMask. For instance we use it to store created accounts. Interacting with state is very easy and can be simplified to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript{numberLines:\" data-meta=\"true}\">const request = async (method: 'clear' | 'get' | 'update', newState?: unknown): Promise&#x3C;any> => {\nif (['get', 'clear'].includes(method) &#x26;&#x26; newState) {\n    throw new Error(`Cannot ${method} with newState`);\n}\nif (method == 'update' &#x26;&#x26; !newState) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot call update without newState');\n}\n\nconst params = newState ? [method, newState] : [method];\nreturn await wallet.request({\n    method: `snap_manageState`,\n    params,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>snap_getBip44Entropy_</code> - to get entropy from MetaMask seed. <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snap-getbip44entropy\">docs</a></p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that there exists very cool MetaMask library <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/browser-passworder\">passworder</a>, which allow us to easily encrypt and decrypt state. In our case as a symmetric key to encrypt state we have used entropy from the MetaMask seed once again.</p>\n<p><strong>The SDK</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s recap, we have hacked polkadot app by injecting some javascript here and there enabling usage of the Snap. The Snap can get entropy from the seed inside MetaMask and manage encrypted state. So the last step would be to integrate with the SDK for the Aleph Zero - <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/\">polkadotjs</a>.</p>\n<p>That seems like a easy task, just run <code>npm install @polkadot/api</code> and import it. However importing dependencies to Snap can be challening. This difficulties appears, because Snap is not evaluated directly on javascript virtual machine, it first has to be sandboxed in Secure Ecma Script (SES). In short, code which normally compile without any problems could fail when loading in <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-development-guide.html#fixing-build-eval-issues\">SES</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">Code</a></p>\n<p>When working with most of the librariers we wont have any problems, but it wasn’t case for us. We had two issues with evaluating <code>polkadotjs SDK</code> inside SES, to mitigate them we have written two scripts which were run on bundled source code.</p>\n<p>First of them was caused by incorrectly formatted wasm code embedded inside javascript file. Here is the fixing script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst dirPath =\n  '../../../../node_modules/@substrate/smoldot-light/dist/cjs/instance/autogen';\n\n// SES doesn't like double slashes in strings so we need to replace them with single slashes\n// and string concatenation.\nasync function fixDoubleSlash() {\n  const files = ['wasm0.js', 'wasm1.js', 'wasm2.js'];\n  for (const file of files) {\n    console.log('Fixing ${file}');\n    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, dirPath, file);\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');\n    let fixedContents = contents;\n    while (fixedContents.includes('//')) {\n      fixedContents = fixedContents.split('//').join('/\"+\"/');\n    }\n    await fs.writeFile(filePath, fixedContents);\n  }\n}\n\nfixDoubleSlash();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second issue was also caused, by polkadot extension, which was trying to access <code>window.addEventListener</code> method, which is forbidden in SES. It was also trivally solved with simple</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst bundlePath = path.join(__dirname, '../dist/bundle.js');\n\nasync function fix() {\n  console.log(`Fixing ${bundlePath}`);\n  const contents = await fs.readFile(bundlePath, 'utf8');\n  const replaceMissingTypes = '\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener = function(){};\\n\\n';\n\n  // Looking for a first breakline after the first line of the file\n  // This is where we can safely inject our code\n  const fixed = contents.replace('\\n\\n', replaceMissingTypes);\n  await fs.writeFile(bundlePath, fixed);\n}\n\nfix();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>We’d love to make make our snap fully compatible with polkadot.js and viable as a web wallet in Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Michael is a programmer in a Polish bank working on a daily basis with blockchain technology. He loves programming and learning new stuff.</p>\n<p>Piotr is a software engineer working in NuCypher. He’s interested in privacy, data, and distributed systems.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Piotr - Initially learned about MetaMask Snaps during Devcon in Osaka. The topic resurfaced earlier this year, shortly before EthDenver hackathon.</p>\n<p>Michaeł - Piotr introduced me to MetaMask Snaps, shortly after EthDenver.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>An ability to access application-specific cryptography/private keys in your dapp—it enables building new user flows on top of a familiar browser-wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>The basics are there, but building more sophisticated MetaMask Snaps, especially ones that require custom UI elements, is tricky. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to fit our mental model of web developer experience into Snaps - things like deployment, testing, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a tool which gives real power to the community, everyone for themself decides what features their MetaMask should have. Plugins allows to democratize development and enable faster growth.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Access to more networks (especially non-EVM ones); An ability to tap into transaction lifecycle and add custom logic (like safety checks) or customize the UX; Encrypted storage in the browser for dapp-specific sensitive content, and also an ability to “bring your own cryptography” to your users with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Compiling JS libraries in SES could be difficult, but from our experience it’s not impossible. Feedback loop in developing MetaMask is pretty long, so be sure to write unit tests.</p>\n<p>There is a small but active developers community in MetaMask Snaps - visiting Discord, GitHub discussions etc. can be very rewarding, especially that the product is still new and there is little education avalible outside this bubble.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

We see it everywhere in web2 with PayPal and Venmo, but the fact that indexing makes it such a challenging feature for web3 is an interesting technical problem to think about. I wanted to try creating a proof of concept application that allows any user to set up their own custom notifications for on-chain activities. I used Metamask Snaps' implementation of notifications in order to build out my prototype.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>The technical implementation involved first setting up a notification snap by triggering an installation through a client-side application. Then, the user configures the snap to listen to the on-chain events of their preference. The vision here was that the user would be able to whitelist any contract address and their associated events such that they would prompt not only a notification but also automated on-chain actions such as sending a transaction or executing a DEX trade based on the trigger. The automated send was made possible by deriving the user’s private key from a BIP44 Address Key Deriver (shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ritave/\">Olaf</a> for his workshop using this library) such that the action would go through without an explicit confirmation from the user. My proof of concept was limited to an example of bidding on Opensea and was actualized using Opensea’s API on Rinkeby testnet.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The demo video was based on a proof of concept that only worked for a handful of pre-configured use cases (bidding on Opensea, automating a send of ether). Next steps to actualize this vision would be configuring some type of storage to be able to dynamically update the events that the snap listens to without having to re-install the notification snap. Also showcasing a dashboard for users to monitor their existing snaps and visualizing the events that were triggered in a single-view would be useful. Also, providing a much more customized range of automated trigger actions beyond just sends but enabling a set of more complex contract calls like setting limit orders or arbitraging.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask Snaps when I visited a Metam]Mask booth at the Miami Permissionless conference. The idea that this could become a plugin ecosystem for MetaMask made me really excited.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>No other wallet has customizable plugins tailored towards developers. I believe this is singular to Metamask in the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, building with MetaMask Snaps wasn’t a walk in the park. I think the lack of proper documentation was the biggest drawback. Thankfully, there were enough interesting examples to be able to derive my own innovation from those building blocks, so I could strongly recommend any developer interested in building with snaps to dive straight into the examples repo.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the obvious future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps could unlock a boundless world of possibilities in web3. Just like Chrome has now become the go-to browser with the extensions ecosystem and VSCode similarly with their own extension marketplace. I could totally see MetaMask Snaps taking MetaMask to the next level by allowing developers to onboard onto the tooling and wildly innovate to customize the wallet to their liking (and in turn, attract users who find those tools useful). An interesting tokenomics would be built around the developers who offer the most compelling MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d urge anyone interested in MetaMask Snaps to dive straight into the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">example repo</a>, fork it, and play around with it!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!
