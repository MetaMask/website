\n<p><strong>MetaMask’s HackerOne Bug Bounty Program Takes the Cake!</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask's bug bounty program (BBP) got a shout-out from both HackerOne founders for setting a great example to others. This was due to our quick adoption of new policy improvements like Open Scope, which rewards reports for all our assets based on impact, and Fast Payment, ensuring we pay out within a month of receiving a vulnerability report. Our program has been going from strength to strength, with some impressive stats over the last 90 days: 120 reports received, an average time from submission to bounty of 3 days and 15 hours, and a total of $266,000 paid out to date. This showcases the incredible success we’ve been having, and we would like to thank our community of talented hackers such as <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/pkkr?type=user\">pkkr</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/imnarendrabhati\">imnarendrabhati</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BkankitBk**\">p1security</a>, <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/nicocha30?type=user\">Nicocha30</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/T41nk_\">T41nk**</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/T41nk_\">René Kroka</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/renniepak**\">renniepak</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackerOn2Wheels**\">hackerOnTwoWheels</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redyetidev**\">redyetihacks</a>.

In this scam, the victim is tricked into sending funds to a fake address that closely resembles a legitimate one. MistTrack, a cryptocurrency compliance firm, reported the incident, noting the irony of scammers being targeted by other scammers.

The attacker sent an email posing as a collaboration with Lido DAO, directing recipients to a website that promised high returns on staked Ethereum, but in reality was a drainer site. The Ethereum security team quickly blocked the attack, alerted the community, and submitted the malicious link to blocklists. No losses were reported, and Ethereum is now migrating some email services to enhance security.</p>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/A-Squarespace-Retrospective-or-How-to-Coordinate-an-Industry-Wide-Incident-Response-fead693b66c14543a48283d85aec19ad?pvs=4\"><strong>Threat Actor Exploits Vulnerability in Squarespace to Conduct Account Takeovers</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Researchers discovered that weak security defaults in Squarespace's domain registration process <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/researchers-weak-security-defaults-enabled-squarespace-domains-hijacks/\">allowed attackers to hijack domains.</a> The vulnerabilities included insufficient verification steps and the ability to change domain settings without proper authentication. These flaws enabled attackers to take control of domains, redirect traffic, and potentially steal sensitive information.

This month, the agency followed up with a more in-depth look into how these scams work and what to look out for. They often involve convincing victims to set up cryptocurrency accounts or transfer funds, ultimately stealing their money. The FBI advises job seekers to be cautious of unsolicited job offers, verify the legitimacy of employers, and avoid sharing personal or financial information with unverified sources. Victims of such scams are encouraged to report the incidents to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should express increased scrutiny of financial opportunities, such as jobs requiring them to provide initial funds, jobs that cannot be verified independently, or jobs that appear randomly.

(1) Limit the assets of the wallet you browse daily with. If you sign a malicious signature, the impact will be minimized. (2) Validate the domain the signature request originates from and verify it matches the domain of the original project. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the project's official social media or blog page and check that the domains from these profiles match the request. (3) Validate the token and address contents of the request. The request will often involve a token you did not intend to send. The <code>spender</code> address and or the <code>to</code> address of the transactions will be different than the address you intended. These simple checks can save you from unintended fund loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/299099/attacker-sends-nearly-24000-phishing-emails-derived-from-compromised-coingecko-third-party-email-platform\"><strong>23K Phishing Emails Sent After CoinGeko's 3rd-Party Email Service is Compromised</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, experienced a data breach on June 5 due to a compromised account at their third-party email marketing platform, GetResponse.

CoinGecko is investigating the breach with GetResponse, informing affected users, and reviewing security procedures to enhance protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It’s recommended that users use caution when approaching emails about claim airdrops or tokens. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Crypto projects should be aware of the security controls used by the third-party vendors they are collaborating with.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://slowmist.medium.com/unraveling-how-a-malicious-extension-stole-a-million-dollars-e847a83cc50e\">\nSlowMist Reveals How a Malicious Aggr Chrome Extension Stole $1M+ in Crypto</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Aggr, marketed as a trading data aggregator, is a Chrome extension. In early June, a Binance user reported a loss of US$1 million in cryptocurrency, which was traced back to the Aggr plugin as the attack vector. SlowMist uncovered that Aggr harvested the cookies of traders utilizing the extension, specifically targeting cookies associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. With these cookies, the malicious actors behind Aggr were able to gain entry to Centralized Exchange (CEX) portals and take control of the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It's crucial for users to be vigilant when downloading any software onto their computers, including applications from browser stores. Researching the developers of extensions is an important step in ensuring safety. A simple review of their personal profile or recent track record should give you a good gauge of whether you can trust them. Developers who are anonymous or have no previous history available should be avoided in favor of those who are verified and reputable. Additionally, reviewing the app may give you more insight into its credibility.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Безопасность","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: June 2024","metaDescription":"Lots going on with our privacy policy update, new installment of the State of Security, and big news that Wallet Guard is joining Consensys!","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"6TtJpzJ2SXRg0vfryYpZqw","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: May 2024","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-may-2024","subtitle":"2024 is flying by!

Pink Drainer recently announced they are shutting down citing: “We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it's time for us to retire.” Despite Pink Drainer's end, the threat of similar operations looms. Pink Drainer wrote, “It is very likely that our retirement will have no major impact on the scene, people will move on to other drainers just as quickly as they moved to us.”</p>\n<p>Although Pink Drainer is retiring, there are still other popular active wallet drainers.

Initially focusing on government agencies to steal intelligence, it shifted in 2014 towards targeting global financial institutions and virtual currency trading venues, engaging in the theft of money and assets. The group has employed phishing attacks through fake social accounts that offer bogus job opportunities to individuals in specific industries. Recently, security researchers uncovered a series of attacks involving ZIP files with malicious JS code targeting blockchain developers through job postings on platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and Braintrust. These attacks, consistent with Lazarus's \"Contagious Interview\" campaign, involve tricking candidates into running malicious code that steals crypto-related information and implants malware.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against phishing and malware attacks like those executed by groups such as Lazarus, it's crucial to verify the legitimacy of unexpected job offers through independent research and to maintain robust digital hygiene. This includes using up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security, and exercising caution with email attachments and links from unknown sources. Additionally, keeping all software updated is essential to guard against exploitable vulnerabilities. By adopting these practices, individuals can significantly bolster their defenses against sophisticated cyber threats and safeguard their sensitive information</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/etherscan/status/1788550675993174409\">Address Poisoning Attacks on the Rise, leading a recent victim to a $68M Loss</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Address poisoning is a deceptive tactic where attackers manipulate victims' transaction histories to trick them into sending funds to the wrong address. This method involves creating fake tokens, using 'vanity' addresses that closely resemble the target's, and exploiting the ERC-20 token standard's \"transferFrom()\" function. Attackers employ these strategies to conduct zero-value token transfers and spoofed token transfers, making their fraudulent addresses appear legitimate. These attacks are designed to confuse users into copying the wrong address for their transactions, leading to financial losses. The sophistication of these methods highlights the evolving nature of cyber threats in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against address poisoning, users should avoid copying addresses directly from their transaction history and instead, copy them from a trusted source. Implementing domain names for addresses can enhance distinguishability, though users must be cautious of domain name spoofing. Utilizing an address book feature provided by wallet services or adding a private name tag on platforms like Etherscan to whitelist trusted addresses can help users easily identify and avoid spoofed addresses.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"ru","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Безопасность","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: May 2024","metaDescription":"2024 is flying by!

This enhancement allows us to generate policies for files using ESM syntax, both for the webpack plugin and for our new tool that's being developed on top of Endo.</p>\n<p>Support for target: 'node' is coming to the LavaMoat Webpack Plugin in the next release. We've made it handle the concept of built-in modules.</p>\n<p>Lockdown has now been permanently released on MetaMask mobile for iOS.</p>\n<p>We're also in the process of enhancing our docs to streamline the LavaMoat onboarding experience for the wider ecosystem. We're putting together educational videos to demystify LavaMoat's mechanics and showcase optimal usage practices for applications.
