infrastructure, and the largest non-custodial ETH staking provider. This partnership will expand MMI’s institutional staking marketplace, which launched in March 2023.</p>\n<p>The addition of Figment to MMI’s staking marketplace brings MMI’s offering to five aggregated institutional staking providers, alongside Consensys Staking, and three others. With this decentralized approach, MMI offers institutions the choice among the industry's top tier providers, together with standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting, and a simplified staking experience. MMI’s institutional staking marketplace brings a unique and enhanced staking experience to all kinds of organizations seeking to engage in Web3.</p>\n<p>Before we dive deeper into the Figment-MMI partnership, let’s recap why staking is crucial for Ethereum, and how institutions stake.</p>\n<h2>Institutions and Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking was a core component of Ethereum’s move to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, away from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, in September last year.</p>\n<p>Staking entails depositing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toghrulmaharram/status/1530708903440302082\">32 ETH</a> to activate another validator, or node, to the network. These validators play a crucial role in achieving consensus by proposing new blocks, and verifying and attesting to the validity of other proposed blocks. As the number of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md\">honest validators</a> increases, the cost of attacking the network rises, significantly enhancing Ethereum's economic security.</p>\n<p>Ethereum’s upgrade to PoS brought numerous advantages, enhancing settlement <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#finality\">finality</a> guarantees, enabling <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/\">sharding</a>, and significantly reducing <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/\">ETH issuance</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/\">energy usage</a>. From the standpoint of an Ethereum user, this transition also opened up a fresh avenue for earning additional token rewards through <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#:~:text=Further%20reading-,What%20is%20staking%3F,new%20ETH%20in%20the%20process\">staking</a>.</p>\n<p>Staking can be an integral part of an institution’s digital asset strategy, especially since the Shanghai/Capella upgrade earlier this year. This upgrade enabled withdrawals of the ETH that had been locked on Ethereum’s consensus layer since December 2020, when staking was first enabled on the Beacon chain.</p>\n<p>However, the nuances and complexity of institutional staking can deter companies looking to participate. Choosing the right vendor for institutional staking can be complicated due to the differences in the fees charged, slashing coverage, infrastructure, terms and conditions,  and reporting standards. In addition, various staking providers offer different benefits to institutions, ranging from differences in infrastructure (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client) to certifications (SOC2 Type 2 and ISO 27001).</p>\n<p>Institutions often want to select their node locations too. This can help them comply with the regulations of the jurisdiction their nodes are in, and ensure the network is decentralized by choosing diverse node locations, among other things.</p>\n<p>MMI’s institutional staking marketplace is aimed at streamlining this complex staking experience for institutions and leveling the playing field by bringing together best-in-class partners to provide institutions with a simple one-click staking experience.</p>\n<h2>MMI Staking Marketplace</h2>\n<p>MMI’s staking marketplace provides access to top-tier staking providers; offers standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting; and a simplified staking experience—to facilitate broader institutional web3 participation.</p>\n<p>Institutions often require multiple custodial integrations to engage in web3, depending on their regulatory requirements, and security and privacy needs. It also means institutions are bound by the provider their custodian has chosen. However, MetaMask Institutional today <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">is integrated</a> with 12 custody and self-custody platforms globally.

In TradFi, custodians, such as banks, keep assets safe from loss, theft, and unauthorized use; they facilitate settlement and clearing of transactions; comply with necessary regulations; and maintain a record of transactions and report them to investors.</p>\n<p>Similarly, custody in the institutional crypto world refers to the mechanisms in place to ensure the safety and security of an institution’s crypto assets. A third-party, also called a custodian, manages the institutional customer’s private keys, along with creating processes to approve and sign transactions. Custodians deploy various key management solutions including hardware security modules, multi-party computation, and multi-signature (multi-sig) to provide privacy, data integrity, identification and authentication.</p>\n<p>They also interact directly with broker/dealers and exchanges to facilitate transactions for fund managers. They are paramount to safely acquiring and holding crypto assets.</p>\n<p>A financial institution that wishes to engage with web3 needs a custodian to ensure that it is compliant with regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>MMI partners with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">12 custodians</a>, providing a choice of unparalleled institutional key management solutions to customers. In addition, MetaMask serves over 30M monthly active users and is connected to almost every web3 dapp. We thus offer unrivaled access to web3. We pair this ecosystem access with crucial features that organizations need to engage in the space– making MMI the best way for organizations to transact on-chain with institution-required security and operational efficiency.</p>\n<p>Now let’s look at some pros and cons for organizations using a custodian to access web3.</p>\n<h3>Pros of Crypto Custody</h3>\n<h4>Security and Risk Mitigation</h4>\n<p>Storing crypto carries the risk of losing one’s private keys and in turn, losing access to all digital assets. For this reason, organizations trust custodians to safely store their private keys so that they don’t bear the risks of self-storage.</p>\n<p>Custodians also often provide insurance against third-party hacks, theft of private keys, and other such risky scenarios. This provides an additional layer of safety to institutional investors. Most times it is also a regulatory requirement for organizations to use a custodian when interacting with web3.</p>\n<h4>Expertise and Enhanced Support Services</h4>\n<p>Apart from securing a customer’s digital assets, custodians provide knowledge on other services that organizations can tap into to expand their web3 understanding. For example, custodians can offer brokerage services to organizations.</p>\n<p>Custodians also have extensive knowledge of asset custody that can help organizations navigate complex custody requirements and industry best practices.</p>\n<h4>Regulatory Compliance</h4>\n<p>Licensed custodians offer regulatory compliance to institutional investors. They are regularly audited and are required to comply with know-your-customer/ anti-money laundering (KYC/ AML) procedures, and other compliance measures based on their jurisdiction. They are allowed to hold digital assets on behalf of a customer, much like a bank. An example of a licensed custodian is BitGo, which is also an MMI partner.</p>\n<h3>Cons of Crypto Custody</h3>\n<h4>High Costs</h4>\n<p>Engaging a custodian means paying a fee, along with account maintenance and asset storage costs. These fees can be expensive, and may eventually not justify the returns on investment, especially for smaller institutional investors or those with limited resources.</p>\n<h4>Limited Control over Assets</h4>\n<p>By allowing a custodian to control their digital assets and transactions, organizations can relinquish some decision-making authority. Many times, custodians have to set governance standards and approval policies for the custodian in order to comply with regulations. The custodian holds an investor’s assets, therefore, the investor may not be able to respond to lucrative market situations quickly enough to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>Since a custodian holds the investor’s private keys, they become a single point of failure. Any disruptions or failures on the part of the custodian can negatively impact the organization's investments and assets.</p>\n<h4>Limited Asset Choices</h4>\n<p>Custodians may only provide support for certain digital assets to institutional investors. This can be a challenging situation for investors as it can lead to lack of diversity in their web3 portfolio. It can also limit them from exploring alternative assets such as tokens linked to emerging blockchain technology and prohibit investors from gaining access to the latest on-chain market opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Rise of Self-Custody</h2>\n<p>Due to the strict regulatory requirements that institutional investors need to comply with, self-custody is often a tricky option. This is where custody tech providers come in. They help create the technology for custodial services that can be managed by the customer themselves. In this case, the private keys are managed by an organization themselves.</p>\n<p>The implosion of FTX, one of the largest centralized exchanges in web3, and the subsequent liquidity crisis at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank have brought the idea of self-custody into much sharper focus. These instances underlined the age-old crypto adage of “not your keys, not your crypto”.</p>\n<p>The collapse of SVB drove nearly <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-control-from-traditional-web3-custody-rita-martins/?trk=public_post_main-feed-card_feed-article-content\">$70K worth of Bitcoin into self-custody wallets</a>. While this is an expected outcome of extreme market volatility, the one trend that stood out in the recent market exodus was that the charge was led by institutional money, according to <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/personal-wallets-institutional-crypto-adoption-self-custody-defi/\">a Chainalysis report</a>.</p>\n<p>A custody tech provider gives the nuts and bolts, i.e the security infrastructure, technology to set up own governance rules, and different custody options to organizations to build their own custody solutions. Unlike custodians, custody tech providers do not have permission to execute transactions on behalf of an institution, or have access or control over their digital assets.</p>\n<p>Users of MMI can access self-custody options through <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/consensys-and-gnosis-safe-partner-to-introduce-self-custodial-digital-asset-solutions-for-enterprises-looking-for-web3-adoption/\">Safe</a>, a leading on-chain multi-sig contract wallet provider and digital asset management platform, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">Qredo</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">GK8</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-and-fireblocks-integrate-to-offer-unrivaled-defi-and-web3-access/\">Fireblocks</a>, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">Parfin</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s explore the pros and cons of self-custody for institutional investors.</p>\n<h3>Pros of Self-Custody</h3>\n<h4>Enhanced Control</h4>\n<p>Self-custody gives institutional investors direct control over their crypto assets, and includes managing their private keys. By directly interacting with blockchain networks, investors can reduce the risk of third-party interference and unauthorized access. This allows institutions to create their own security processes and use cold storage solutions for increased security.</p>\n<p>Direct control over their digital assets also allows institutions to interact with their choice of decentralized applications and DeFi protocols supported by the custody tech provider, without relying on intermediaries.</p>\n<h4>Improved Privacy</h4>\n<p>Having control over their private keys and transactions with self-custody ensures that institutional investors have greater privacy and confidentiality. Since investors have direct control over their transactions, they do not need to disclose their transactions and holdings to third-parties, thereby reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information about their investments.</p>\n<h4>Access to Diverse Assets</h4>\n<p>As we read above, custodians are often unable to provide access to a wide range of digital assets in web3 due to the strict regulatory requirements they have to comply with. These assets may include various cryptocurrencies, tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By choosing to self-custody their assets, institutional investors can take an independent call on the kinds of digital assets they want to invest in, depending on their investment objectives.</p>\n<h3>Cons of Self-Custody</h3>\n<h4>Security Risks</h4>\n<p>Institutional investors have full responsibility for the security of their private keys and digital assets when they choose self-custody. Any lapses in security or mishandling of private keys can have dire consequences, including permanent loss of their digital assets. Self-custody often does not provide backup services and the complexity of setting up robust security mechanisms to ensure protection against phishing attacks and theft can be challenging for institutions new to web3.</p>\n<h4>Lack of Institutional Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>Self-custody may not be a feasible option for all institutional investors. Without the expertise of a custodian, institutions may find it challenging to meet regulatory obligations, internal governance requirements, and shareholder expectations about investment returns.</p>\n<p>In addition, establishing the necessary security infrastructure for safely storing digital assets, creating auditing mechanisms and other compliance procedures can lead to operational complexities and may be resource intensive.</p>\n<h4>Regulatory Challenges</h4>\n<p>Self-custody for institutions in web3 is still in its nascent stage, and it operates in a regulatory landscape that is rapidly evolving. Institutional investors need to ensure that they comply with the regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions, especially those that deal with KYC/ AML. In such cases, choosing self-custody can increase the burden of compliance on institutions and can also lead to potential risk of non-compliance.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>As we have seen above, each of the two approaches to custody of digital assets for institutional investors have their benefits and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>While some organizations may want to take advantage of increased control over their assets with self-custody, others may want to work with a custodian that can provide them enhanced features such as staking and lending.</p>\n<p>As such, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach that can work for all institutions. This is why MMI offers the widest range of top-tier custody and self-custody solutions to institutional investors. MMI is the only multi-custodial institutional web3 wallet, and its custody options aim to meet all variations of institutional-grade custody requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MMI</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"इंस्टीट्यूशंस","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2AIRt8MBePwdwcrsG8sR7r","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional Launches a More Powerful Web3 Portfolio Dashboard for Organizations","slug":"metamask-institutional-launches-a-more-powerful-web3-portfolio-dashboard-for","subtitle":"MMI’s upgraded portfolio dashboard offers a range of cutting-edge tools—including portfolio management, digital asset monitoring, in-depth transaction reporting, and institutional controls.","image":{"title":"MMIPD","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=128&h=72&q=80&fm=webp 128w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=128&h=72&q=80&fm=png 128w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"March 23, 2023","authors":[{"name":"Johann Bornman","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we seek to drastically improve how organizations access and engage with web3. Over the last two years, we have built features in service of our goal to bridge all organizations into the web3 ecosystem.

These tools include institutional controls, portfolio management, digital asset monitoring, and in-depth transaction reporting, all in one place.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we dive into what’s new, how these features impact users, and how they redefine the institutional web3 experience.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://youtu.be/6duEdFALQR0\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/portfolio/\">Explore the Web3 Portfolio Dashboard\n</a></strong></p>\n<h1>Portfolio Management</h1>\n<p>On our web3 portfolio dashboard, organizations are now able to swap crypto and stake ETH seamlessly within the dashboard interface.</p>\n<h2>Swap Crypto</h2>\n<p>The MMI dashboard allows users to identify the best priced quote for their swap by pooling liquidity data from multiple aggregators, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs). This allows organizations to take advantage of optimal gas prices, and transact with some of the lowest failure rates.</p>\n<p>MMI’s swap feature provides users with a simplified experience, enabling them to swap any ERC-20 token across multiple DEXs. This feature was previously only accessible through the MMI browser extension.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2iu3OwffKc\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Stake ETH</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most significant upgrade within the MMI portfolio dashboard is the launch of the first institutional ETH staking marketplace. Previously, choosing the right staking service provider could be challenging for organizations due to the complexities between different providers’ infrastructure configurations (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client), certifications, reporting standards, fee structures, and terms and conditions (T&#x26;C).</p>\n<p>MMI addresses this complexity by simplifying vendor selection and streamlining access to four top-tier institutional staking providers with standardized T&#x26;Cs, comprehensive reporting templates, and a significantly simplified staking experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/632mmsR7BJgfZO8cIolYlV/36cc36dbc0d8f3e7e0243f7c659e5ae9/Staking-marketing-screen.png\" alt=\"Staking-marketing-screen\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-launches-the-first-marketplace-for-institutional-staking-on-metamask-institutional-in-partnership-with-allnodes-blockdaemon-and-kiln\">Read the press release</a></strong></p>\n<p>Today, organizations can choose to stake their ETH with Allnodes, Blockdaemon, Consensys, and Kiln from within the MMI portfolio dashboard, and earn rewards for securing the Ethereum blockchain. Once withdrawals are activated by the Shanghai/Capella Upgrade in April, organizations will be able to withdraw from within the dashboard as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\"><strong>Explore the Institutional Marketplace</strong></a></p>\n<h1>Digital Asset Monitoring</h1>\n<p>Digital asset monitoring on the MMI portfolio dashboard allows organizations to see a consolidated view of their web3 assets across all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains in one place.</p>\n<h2>See Performance and P&#x26;L Attribution</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows organizations to see their portfolio’s performance and profit &#x26; loss attribution for all ERC-20 tokens and 10 of the largest DeFi protocols—a feature that is uniquely offered by MMI.</p>\n<p>We do this by using our transaction simulator and DeFi adapters to simulate the selling of the token of a liquidity provider (LP), to break up the LP token into its underlying supplied tokens within a position. We also determine the claimed and unclaimed rewards of the positions. This allows organizations to understand the value of their DeFi positions, including the profit or loss and performance of their positions at all times.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3kT4g33ZcjARN94P0w7iXS/9ef5c79191822606582008d288ea3fb6/bwzcky6fhRg7WQ-Xiep4YcryohZr2U6PMEX7dkEcbs36eBlIMQUnrrXaXrq3gT7w0ggVSR17dw8dlbuS4bQMH3YmpioJzn2o6lDitGbHJon_vNruoFhuYUvBA29Z.png\" alt=\"bwzcky6fhRg7WQ-Xiep4YcryohZr2U6PMEX7dkEcbs36eBlIMQUnrrXaXrq3gT7w0ggVSR17dw8dlbuS4bQMH3YmpioJzn2o6lDitGbHJon vNruoFhuYUvBA29ZiqcC\"></p>\n<h2>Track NFTs</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows users to view detailed metrics for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) held across different custodians, wallets, accounts, and marketplaces. It provides organizations with improved capability around their NFT holdings, with metrics including average sale price, aggregate floor price data from different marketplaces, price estimates, collection price history, historical price charts, rarity rank, and traits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/CgcXcxcreKbra3kVuUlBq/bc52db0e1dc596a2efb2489643144621/MDaNFV2R75l1rH2L3KyMBudtwR-1AWkikv4yCsVOzFSnyg0n7ORN8O_-zZcvGc4zncLpaV7mtpH1duYnZQ4crQ14gxB9O5LeHvPs40755U6rJmsvM6gyVjUEqHZd.png\" alt=\"MDaNFV2R75l1rH2L3KyMBudtwR-1AWkikv4yCsVOzFSnyg0n7ORN8O -zZcvGc4zncLpaV7mtpH1duYnZQ4crQ14gxB9O5LeHvPs40755U6rJmsvM6gyVjUEqHZdRECX\"></p>\n<h2>Bundle Accounts</h2>\n<p>The dashboard enables organizations to group accounts into portfolio bundles across their team or organization. The MMI dashboard and browser extension allows users to have up to 100 accounts. By bundling these accounts, they can better manage and monitor account and portfolio activity</p>\n<h2>Manage Assets with a Web3 Focus</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows organizations to monitor their web3 assets across all EVM chains. They can see a breakdown of their organization’s portfolio, including digital asset holdings, sector allocation, protocol allocation, performance, and historical transactions. They can also add smart contract addresses and valuations that they wish to monitor.</p>\n<h1>Transaction Reporting</h1>\n<p>Comprehensive transaction reporting is crucial for organizations that are required to share transaction history and details with stakeholders such as fund admins, LPs, and other third parties.</p>\n<h2>Classify Transactions</h2>\n<p>Users can now see transactions classified as a transfer, bridge, fee, yield, or the supply or removal of liquidity. This in-depth reporting and labeling will save hours in transaction history reconciliation with fund admins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4IykaVFGVGR8cMAS1zLc9u/4a8eae9b70e9f9416e9daad14c4ad577/IoO5_Q7SsjbEaNqBKaDL_0TPngkVn-clPW5BAguQ9U1EAGe2Eub2W5DT2DJPxx3tMOk7oqdWTug9dyBboEtt-V2Y0ZKsI0HjY0SLV5czIHz7kNWqQKvDkoSKW8be.png\" alt=\"IoO5 Q7SsjbEaNqBKaDL 0TPngkVn-clPW5BAguQ9U1EAGe2Eub2W5DT2DJPxx3tMOk7oqdWTug9dyBboEtt-V2Y0ZKsI0HjY0SLV5czIHz7kNWqQKvDkoSKW8beGmPU\"></p>\n<h2>Take Snapshots</h2>\n<p>Users can also generate a read-only view of their organization’s holdings and transactions over a given timeframe.

And while Q3 continued the trend, Crypto’s volatility appears to have been matched and outdone by many G8 bond markets and currencies. “May you live in interesting times”, the apocryphal saying goes. Interesting times indeed. While the traditional world repeats its old boom and bust, inflation and deflation cycles, we within Crypto aim to build a new and better system. Arguably, one of the most significant steps to bring this new system to fruition occurred in Q3, as <a href=\"https://consensys.net/merge/\">Ethereum moved from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake</a>. The upgrade was one of the many bright lights in Web3, another reason to be profoundly confident about the future of our ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Bear markets are essential periods to build, and MetaMask Institutional’s (MMI) goal has been to stand on ceremony. Hence, our focus for the quarter was to lay the necessary foundations that allow us to be and continue to be a bright light within Web3. For those reading this circular for the first time, it is MMI’s mission to bridge every organization on earth into Web3. We believe Web3 is eating the world; therefore, we provide and will continue to provide unrivaled access to it. Regardless of the interface, API or key management solution an institution needs. Hence, we think deeply about the infrastructure, tools, features and products required to achieve this. Our quarter, in summary, is a reflection of these values.</p>\n<h2>Acquisition, Engagement and Retention</h2>\n<p>In Q3, we announced our next <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-onboards-four-new-institutional-custodians-consolidating-its-leadership-as-the-go-to-solution-for-organizations-entering-web3/\">set of custodian partners</a>, bringing our total custodian partners to 11 globally. We now offer the most expansive suite of custodial integrations on the market, ensuring unrivaled access to custody and different key management solutions in <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">different jurisdictions</a>. Thus, regardless of the allocation strategy, crypto asset, or network an organization has or needs access to, we can cater to an organization’s needs. In Q3, we grew our onboarded organizations by 26%, the assets deployed using MMI by 85% and our annual recurring revenue by 400%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/lIrjlaLDrufbSXG27Bd8a/fe9a0df889516a08adb9f7a66e2c5f0c/3rd-Custodian-Announcement-Ft.png\" alt=\"3rd-Custodian-Announcement-Ft\"></p>\n<h3>Extension and Custodian Integrations</h3>\n<p>The MMI extension is the frontier experience that provides unrivaled access to all of Web3. And despite the bear market, we continue to see incredibly healthy engagement and more than double industry standard retention metrics. We have been deeply fortunate to see double-digit week-on-week assets deployed growth throughout this year. Hence, we took the time within the last 90 days to lay <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/changelog/\">more extensive infrastructure</a> to cater to the continued wave of users.</p>\n<p>We’ve started to document milestones within MMI’s product development on our change log. Take a look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/changelog/\">Explore Change Log</a></p>\n<h2>Portfolio Dashboard</h2>\n<p>Throughout the quarter, we shipped a range of updates and essential features. We rolled out improved versions of our <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/mmi-introduces-new-reporting-features-for-organizations/\">reporting capabilities, portfolio snapshots</a>, and <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/nft/\">NFT views</a>. Within an organization’s NFT holding, we now provide a variety of historical and real-time valuation data points for an NFT. As I have written in past updates, we follow strict product and design principles within MMI and focus on identifying Tier-1 user needs. Hence, prioritizing building painkillers over vitamins. In product vocabulary, the latter are small features that can and should delight a user. In contrast, the former solves the most critical and pressing needs. We also do a lot of work to strategically layer our features to ensure they build on top of one another and open up adjacent capabilities. Hence, our vitamin features often lead to painkillers. Throughout the quarter, we implemented a few vitamins throughout the portfolio dashboard. From improved visual layouts and charts to allowing filtering for dust tokens, currency settings, and a general settings sections. These vitamins are laying the foundation for two crucial initiatives (and painkillers) that we aim to ship in Q4 and Q1. In Q3, we saw our portfolio dashboard engagement metrics increase by 160% and 8-week retention metrics by 51%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2mvT3J6oiXtWG9wi0xoOGJ/df80b7170520e9bd6f3da04137807ebf/MMI-Snapshots.webp\" alt=\"MMI-Snapshots\"></p>\n<p>We believe the standard for an organization dashboard is incredibly high, and there are so many essential updates we still want to release to meet these standards. However, we are excited about the significant features rolling out in the quarters ahead. Our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/portfolio/\">portfolio dashboard</a> offers a curated institutional experience—the dashboard connects all custodians, accounts, networks, and assets in one place—seamlessly working with the MMI wallet. Hence, we are doing a lot of work to define what we think the institutional user experience should be—both in viewing portfolios and allocating to different digital assets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/56HVuiBgYDnhDkZHlSFx9N/f104fe0706d1b8a82bace7ec54dc9ca7/MMI-Portfolio-Dashboard.webp\" alt=\"MMI-Portfolio-Dashboard\"></p>\n<h2>Programmatic Access</h2>\n<p>As more diverse organizations access Web3, API access (over UI) is often a fundamental demand. As we work towards being the unrivaled bridge into Web3, we have been doing a lot of work to ensure that regardless of the execution method of an organization, we can cater to their needs. Within Q3, we open-sourced a Python version of MMI’s SDK. The MMI SDK is effectively the connector to which all our custodian partners integrate. Clients of MMI and our custodian partners can now quickly build programmatic python scripts and connect to our SDK. Allowing for programmatic transaction creations. This capability will enable organizations to execute programmatically across multiple different custodians. We have many plans for this feature and will build out this library to make crafting different execution strategies as simple as possible. With Programmatic Access, we extend MMI’s access to Web3 through an additional interface.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The quarter saw many vital milestones for MMI. From our custodian announcement, integrations, and continued growth to new and improved features—We have laid essential foundations to deliver, what we believe, will be game-changing features in the quarters ahead. We live for our users and are building a product they not only love, but also can’t live without. For those on this circular that are users of MMI, we no doubt have spoken with you, and we look forward to speaking with you again. To all, we can’t wait to show you what MMI has in-store over the quarters ahead.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>__Johann Bornman</p>\n<p>Global Product Lead, MetaMask Institutional</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"इंस्टीट्यूशंस","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Ensuring MetaMask is safe, secure, and stable enough for continued viral growth | Q3.2022","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/hi-IN/news/institutions/page/9/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/","/news/security/"],"limit":4,"skip":32,"categoryId":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","category":"institutions","totalItems":50,"currentPage":9,"totalPages":13,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"सपोर्ट नहीं करता है। कृपया ऐसा ब्राउज़र डाउनलोड करें जो MetaMask को सपोर्ट करता हो।","by":"के द्वारा","copyLink":"लिंक कॉपी करें","copied":"कॉपी किया गया!"},"slug":"/news/institutions/page/9/","translation":true,"locale":"hi-IN","node_locale":"hi-IN","newsCategories":[{"name":"institutions","categoryId":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","total":50},{"name":"developers","categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","total":67},{"name":"","categoryId":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","total":72},{"name":"security","categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","total":34}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2087975078","2272059946","3000541721","3155062165"],"slicesMap":{}}
