Over the last two years, we have built out its capabilities and functionality to offer rich DeFi data, profit and loss, transaction history, and portfolio valuations through snapshots and account management. We built primitives like swaps and a staking marketplace. This all contributes to our goal, which is to create a product that offers unrivalled web3 access and allows an organisation to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets. Today, the product has an average 8-week retention of 49.63% and an average 4-week retention of 51.10%. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">The average web application has an 8-week retention of 23%.</a></p>\n<p>In our quest to build a product our users can’t live without, our product principles and values ensure that we spend time with our users daily to understand their product needs. One user need we have heard consistently is that no product they use or have seen can truly show them everything. Users can obtain views of their positions across EVMs but must do manual work to reconcile non-EVM allocations and Centralised Exchange data. Therefore, building a truly holistic portfolio requires many hours of manual work. To address this problem, we launched support for Solana last quarter. In Q2 and Q3, we will continue to add additional non-EVM support. However, an area we thought was incredibly important to address was ensuring users could see their Centralised Exchange data and their on-chain positions.</p>\n<h2>DeFi and CeFi</h2>\n<p>We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Mesh, a step towards our mission of providing access to any asset anywhere. This collaboration will enable us to aggregate Prime Accounts from Centralised Exchanges, offering our users a truly consolidated view of their positions. While our initial launch will feature Coinbase Prime data, we're committed to allowing users to link their accounts from a wide range of Prime account providers, ensuring a comprehensive view of their assets.</p>\n<p>Mesh is an embedded finance startup enabling digital asset transfers, crypto payments, account aggregation, and trading within a unified platform. The secure API connects with over 300 major brokerages, centralised exchanges, and self-custody wallets. This partnership is a key step to simplifying account management for institutional users—eventually facilitating seamless asset transfers from exchanges directly to their MMI wallet with a one-click experience using the Mesh API.</p>\n<p>Users can navigate to the accounts section within the Portfolio Dashboard and now, with a few clicks of a button, connect their Coinbase Prime accounts. The accounts will be added to the holdings Section of the Portfolio Dashboard, where accounts can be filtered or added to bundles. These accounts will also be Snapshot to ensure users get a truly holistic valuation of their holdings.</p>\n<p>Over the next quarter, we'll add an extensive list of Centralised Exchanges to ensure the MMI Portfolio Dashboard shows its users everything. Our goal is to ensure our users have unrivalled access and are empowered to monitor, manage, control and report on all their web3 assets, and our partnership with Mesh is a step closer to reaching this goal.</p>\n<p>Add your Prime account to the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, or <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">contact us</a> if you'd like a demo and to learn more.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"इंस्टीट्यूशंस","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"6wM2YEgbUCv3noGozJ5hyI","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional launches DeFi APIs for Institutions","slug":"metamask-institutional-launches-defi-apis-for-institutions","subtitle":"MMI's comprehensive suite of APIs is poised to significantly enhance operational efficiency, data accuracy, and reporting capabilities for institutional users.

This initiative is poised to significantly enhance operational efficiency, data accuracy, and reporting capabilities for institutional users.</p>\n<h1>Understanding the Challenges</h1>\n<p>For institutional on-chain investors, much of their investment is directed towards DeFi opportunities. This makes access to detailed, reliable DeFi data critical to their operational success. Currently, institutional users are required to integrate with a variety of third-party APIs to obtain a comprehensive and accurate assessment of their portfolio's performance, as well as for effective monitoring and reporting. This reliance on multiple third-party APIs can lead to issues with data discrepancies, increased operational complexity, and challenges in data reconciliation. Additionally, those allocating capital to long-tail DeFi protocols frequently face challenges with unreliable or absent data, further complicating investment decisions and risk management.</p>\n<h1>Bridging the Gap with APIs and DeFi Adapters</h1>\n<p>Recognizing the necessity for a standardized, reliable means of accessing DeFi data, MMI has developed robust tools designed to empower users with comprehensive portfolio management, monitoring, and reporting:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>API Offerings</strong>: MMI’s suite of APIs includes Snapshots and Transaction History APIs, and DeFi read and Write APIs. These tools are designed to create real-time portfolio dashboards, improve data indexing for efficient retrieval, and provide precise P&#x26;L and performance data on DeFi positions</li>\n<li><strong>DeFi Adapters</strong>: MMI’s open-source DeFi adapter standard represents a breakthrough in data acquisition and protocol interaction. They serve as connectors between MMI dashboards and various DeFi protocols, simplifying data access and enhancing information reliability.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These tools aim to cater to MMI users’ essential needs: obtaining deep insights into their DeFi investments to make informed, strategic decisions for portfolio management. By reducing dependence on external data providers and offering a scalable, in-house solution, MMI is set to significantly enhance user experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Metamask Institutional delivers so much value to our fund's operations. Tools like their Snapshots, Defi Adapters, multichain support and Snaps really helped us to concentrate many of our needs into a single reliable partner. Having APIs to access these services has made these operations even simpler.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gean, Honey Island Capital</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Accurate P&#x26;L and Performance Data with DeFi Read API</h1>\n<p>The success of our open-source DeFi adapter standard enables us to extend our range of adapters, providing users with accurate DeFi data across an expanded array of protocols. Notably, our DeFi Read API is powered by our DeFi adapters, offering capabilities beyond the Snapshots and Transaction History API by providing detailed profit and loss (P&#x26;L), and performance analytics. Our adapters boast richer data content, with coverage currently extending to approximately 27 protocols.</p>\n<p>Through our open-source DeFi adapter standard, protocols can independently develop adapters, enabling MMI and MetaMask users to access protocol-specific data. With the increasing adoption of our open-source library, we foresee a future whereby any new protocol will immediately build an adapter next to integrating with MetaMask, hence ensuring availability of data upon launch of the protocol. If you want to learn more about MMI’s DeFi adapters and its open-source DeFi library, read <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/mmis-defi-adapters-are-powering-the-future-of-defi/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Looking Ahead: Expanding the Ecosystem</h1>\n<p>By pioneering these tools, MMI is solidifying its leadership in the industry.

Since the advent of yield farming kicked off the DeFi summer, we have seen an explosion of innovation that is second to none. DeFi has rebuilt the financial system from first principles. It offers basic primitives for swapping, lending, borrowing, saving, investing, options and derivatives in a transparent, interoperable, permissionless way. DeFi democratises access to these primitives for anyone, anywhere.</p>\n<p>In the traditional world, one might think of these tools as simple building blocks. DeFi takes it a step further, creating complex strategies like self-repaying loans, recursive yield strategies, the yield farming of airdrops and the ability to connect all these primitives seamlessly to achieve the highest reward rate possible. This level of innovation is generating interest from professional traders and institutions, who are stepping into on-chain in a meaningful manner for the first time.</p>\n<p>DeFi, therefore, can and has profoundly and positively impacted the world. However, navigating this complex world becomes difficult, especially when it comes to access toDeFi data. Users can stake into a decentralised exchange (DEX) to receive yield and rewards and an LP token to reflect their position. They can then lock that LP token into a vesting contract to boost their reward rate further and receive a Locked or Vested LP token. These staking, re-staking and recursive loops are common due to the interoperable nature of DeFi and can result in token exposure and claimed and unclaimed rewards several layers deep. In the world of institutions, having accurate valuations of these positions and rewards is profoundly crucial. Net Asset Values (NAV) and performance are tied to accurate marked-to-market valuations and the ability to make precise decisions based on profit, loss, and performance.</p>\n<p>Today, the challenges related to DeFi data are being solved by several players in the market, most notably through the indexing of data and tagging, labelling and categorising different smart contracts. This allows a data provider to determine the balance of a position in a pool and show the underlying token balances of a position. Despite these efforts, there is a constant race with cutting-edge users (like professional traders and DeFi Funds) to stay updated with the latest protocols.</p>\n<p>At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we have been deeply involved with solving these data challenges. We have a user-centric culture and our product principles denote that we speak with users every day. Over the last two years, we have spent 10,000 hours in the DeFi data trenches:first building with sub-graphs; then building simulators to simulate closing position and the value of the underlying tokens; and lastly, speaking with the consumers and producers of DeFi data. Namely users who need accurate DeFi positions, and with DeFi protocols that need and want users to interact with their protocols. In conjunction with this race for data in a world of permissionless innovation, we also found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DeFi protocols were not being connected with users at scale</li>\n<li>There is no standard for both read and write DeFi access</li>\n<li>Few scaled approaches benefit the wider ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, we set out to build a DeFi adapter standard that is focused on achieving the following goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provide a standardised adapter implementation specification for both read and write data.</strong> We want to enable any protocol engineer to build an adapter in less than four hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide Rich and in-depth DeFi data.</strong> We resolve an LP token into the underlying token exposure to value a position. We also offer proper time-weighted profit &#x26; loss (P&#x26;L) and return data, therefore accounting for inflows and outflows, claimed and unclaimed rewards to arrive at the correct P&#x26;L and performance position.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit the wider ecosystem</strong>. We want to create an open-source standard that benefits consumers of the data, drives users to DeFi protocols and allows anyone to fork and use the repository.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What Are MMI's DeFi Adapters?</h1>\n<p>The simplest way to think of our DeFi adapters (aptly named) is to think of DeFi as a new on-chain world with its own electricity, which is DeFi data. Our adapters are literally (and metaphorically) equivalent to adapter plugs that can take this DeFi electricity (on-chain DeFi data) and convert it into DeFi views in an easily understandable user interface. The best example of the output of this data can be found in the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, where we show rich DeFi views of the underlying token exposure.</p>\n<p>We also show P&#x26;L and performance using accurate time-weighted return calculations. This means we account for the value of a position today, the deposits (inflows) and withdrawals (outflows), and both claimed and unclaimed rewards to determine the accurate return and performance of a position over the last day, seven days and one month. The DeFi adapters will also power MetaMask Portfolio in showing DeFi data to users.</p>\n<p>We have created this standard and repository to make the DeFi adapter building as seamless as possible. When a DeFi protocol is built and adopted, its LP tokens are immediately shown in the MMI Portfolio Dashboard,  followed by MetaMask portfolio. This ensures LP tokens and positions are visible to institutions and consumers and gives a DeFi protocol broad access to the most extensive user base in crypto. Users, therefore, benefit from seeing their position, and DeFi protocols benefit from users being able to interact with accurate data.</p>\n<p>Our eventual goal is to make the adapters a standard on par with MetaMask wallet support, ensuring depth and breadth, and long-tail access to any DeFi protocol. This means we foresee a future where as soon as a DeFi protocol is created, it will immediately add support for MetaMask and build an adapter so that MMI and MetaMask users can access the DeFi protocol and also have their LP tokens shown across MetaMask and MMI user experiences. This helps us to avoid having to race our users to provide data in cutting-edge protocols, as wallet access and LP tokens support will be there since inception.</p>\n<h1>Developer Experience</h1>\n<p>With our user-centric product principles, we have built a repository with several features to empower developers to build and consume DeFi adapters. Our explicit goal is to allow any protocol engineer to spend a maximum of four engineering hours to build a new DeFi adapter.</p>\n<p>We have also created communication channels to support engineers in creating adapters. We have a seamless command line interface (CLI) that guides developers through the primitive they are building and offers existing templates that provide most of the required code. Once an adapter is built, we offer a UI for developers to review and quality assure their output. We also offer a video tutorial and an FAQ section to guide through the process and make the developer experience as simple and seamless as possible.</p>\n<p>On the consumer side of the DeFi data, besides the open-source repository, we currently offer a DeFi API with all the necessary endpoints to value positions and get profits and performance. We also offer a write endpoint to seamlessly generate transaction parameters for a wide range of DeFi protocols, therefore offering programmatic trading. Lastly, we provide a DeFi SDK with automated prompted methods for each supported protocol to empower developers to build further with our adapters.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about MMI’s DeFi API, read <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-apis-for-institutions/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>Our goal is to scale the DeFi protocols that we support over the next two quarters. Our goal within MMI is to offer unrivalled access to any asset anywhere and empower institutions to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets. Our open-source DeFi adapter standard has these first principles at heart and aims to empower users and DeFi protocols and benefit the wider community.</p>\n<p>If you are a DeFi protocol looking to collaborate, <a href=\"https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters\">contact us here</a>.

Security for our users is a core value held across Consensys. We are deeply intentional about how we <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge\">design, architect and build our software</a> and security is embedded into the fabric of the creation of our products. Notably, MetaMask Institutional (MMI) exemplifies our commitment to delivering unparalleled security measures and protections for our users across our product suite.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how MMI safeguards the interests of its users.</p>\n<h1>MMI Extension: A Beacon of Security</h1>\n<p>Contrary to misconceptions, the MMI extension is not a fork of MetaMask. MMI and MetaMask are the same code base, which is continuously updated, maintained and innovated upon by over a hundred engineers with top-tier expertise and experience within the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The MMI Extension has code that is unique to the blue fox, enabling direct connections to custodians. Our custodian API and backend services have also been penetration tested to ensure our architecture is safe and secure. Let’s see how they work: When a user transacts in the MMI extension, the transaction payload is sent to the custodian for approval and signing. After transaction broadcasting, we receive transaction status updates from the custodian via our backend infrastructure (namely a webhook API and a websocket API). These backend services allow for the Extension to be updated with the transaction status. A user therefore receives updates if the transaction is pending, sent, signed or mined.</p>\n<p>The way to envision these backend services and the role they play is to think of a high-speed highway built to take fast and large traffic (transaction details) from the custodian to a user’s Extension instance. However, these backend services have also been made fault-tolerant. If they were to go down for any reason, we have included polling from the Extension itself. Hence, to continue the metaphor, if the highway was down for any reason, we have built another backup road to ensure the Extension fetches the traffic itself from the custodian. The goal of this design was to make sure that the MMI Extension could function independently for our users regardless of our infrastructure. Therefore ensuring accurate reflection of the transaction lifecycle.</p>\n<p>By also connecting to custodians, we offer organisations unrivalled key management solutions that suit their organisational needs. These solutions empower entities to add policy settings and implement multiple signers and approvers to every transaction, bolstering transaction security.</p>\n<p>We also offer <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/unveiling-the-power-of-metamask-snaps-on-mmi/\">MetaMask snaps in MMI</a>, giving institutions the most extensive array of transaction insights. Snaps are features and functionalities, built by third parties, that allow users to customize their MetaMask wallet. The latest version of MetaMask Institutional, Extension 11.4 and up, allows users to select from a range of Transaction Insights Snaps and Notification Snaps to extend the capabilities of their MMI wallet. For instance, when executing trades on Decentralized Exchanges, users can now access comprehensive data that spans from potential smart contract vulnerabilities to projected input and output amounts using transaction simulation. This enhancement substantially aids crypto hedge funds by providing an in-depth understanding of the risks involved before submitting the transaction for signing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-enables-privacy-preserving-security-alerts-with-blockaid/\">Blockaid has been natively built into the MetaMask/MMI extension</a>. This means users receive native transaction insights protection from the extension. By opting in, users can enhance their security with alerts leveraging a unique privacy-preserving feature that simulates a transaction before signing and alerts them to scams. The alerts are currently available on Ethereum Mainnet. You can learn more about how to set up these alerts in your wallet here.</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard: Insightful and Secure</h1>\n<p>MMI’s portfolio dashboard is engineered with the highest security standards, powered by several internally developed APIs, including our customer API. These APIs ensure organisations can customise and control their data and permissions across their teams. Our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://app.drata.com/trust/9cbca327-0c38-11ee-865f-029d78a187d9&#x26;sa=D&#x26;source=docs&#x26;ust=1710254101992866&#x26;usg=AOvVaw3KnJr-CT_Y2ikHpTU9LdN9\">Customer API</a>, having undergone rigorous penetration testing, reflects our unwavering commitment to security. While primarily a read tool, the dashboard does offer the ability to transact. All transactions are first confirmed in the Extension and then approved through a user’s custodian.</p>\n<h1>Exceptional Customer Support</h1>\n<p>Understanding the critical nature of swift support in the digital asset domain, MMI prides itself on offering industry-leading customer support for our users. Our service-level agreement guarantees a response time of four hours, ensuring that our users’ concerns and issues are addressed promptly. Our users can also have direct Telegram groups with the sales, product and engineering teams, streamlining the resolution process and enhancing user satisfaction.</p>\n<h1>Certified Security Excellence</h1>\n<p>Reflecting our dedication to adopting and exceeding industry-standard protocols, MMI has achieved the SOC II Type 1 certification and is currently on the path toward SOC II Type 2 compliance.</p>\n<p>In addition, Consensys has secured the ISO27001 standard, affirming our rigorous security measures and commitment to safeguarding user data and assets.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>At MMI, and Consensys at large, security is not just a feature – it’s a cornerstone of our philosophy and product design. Through advanced technologies, comprehensive testing, and unwavering commitment to our users, we continue to set the standard for security in the digital asset space, ensuring that our institutional users can operate with confidence and peace of mind.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"इंस्टीट्यूशंस","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":"How MMI Provides Security in the Digital Asset Space","metaDescription":"Explore our guide for a comprehensive look at the security pillars defining MMI and Consensys's leadership in blockchain security solutions.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/hi-IN/news/institutions/page/5/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/security/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":16,"categoryId":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","category":"institutions","totalItems":49,"currentPage":5,"totalPages":13,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"सपोर्ट नहीं करता है। कृपया ऐसा ब्राउज़र डाउनलोड करें जो MetaMask को सपोर्ट करता हो।","by":"के द्वारा","copyLink":"लिंक कॉपी करें","copied":"कॉपी किया गया!"},"slug":"/news/institutions/page/5/","translation":true,"locale":"hi-IN","node_locale":"hi-IN","newsCategories":[{"name":"institutions","categoryId":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","total":49},{"name":"security","categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","total":33},{"name":"developers","categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","total":66},{"name":"","categoryId":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","total":68}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2087975078","2272059946","3000541721","3155062165"],"slicesMap":{}}
