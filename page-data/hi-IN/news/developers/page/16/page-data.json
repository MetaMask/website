MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Aleph Zero Snap with Piotr and Michael</h3>\n<p>We chat with Web3 developers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piotrroslaniec\">Piotr</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/konopek68\">Michael</a> who built the Aleph Zero Snap at the ETHWarsaw Hackathon.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lS5-YwOy9gE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>In our views the wallet experience in Polkadot ecosystem is still lacking. On the other hand, integrating with MetaMask Snaps could help onboard an existing population of web3 users to Aleph Zero network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Adapter</strong></p>\n<p>Our snap is composed from two parts. First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the snap is a server and the website is the client. To reflect this natural boundary we have extracted snap API to a separate package named <code>adapter</code>. It exposes all possible methods the website may use to interact with the snap. Such a layer of abstraction, ease usage of the Snap by other clients (websites). Our API can be described by four methods, which names are pretty self-explanatory. If u want to deep dive, here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">code</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const getAccountFromSeed = async (seed: string): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccountFromSeed\", [seed]);\n}\n\nexport const generateNewAccount = async (): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"generateNewAccount\", []);\n}\n\nexport const signTransaction = async (transaction: SignerPayloadJSON): Promise&#x3C;{ signature: string }> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"signTransaction\", [transaction as unknown as string]);\n}\n\nexport const getAccounts = async (): Promise&#x3C;string[]> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccounts\", []);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The app</strong></p>\n<p>So, we explained the glue between our layers, let’s move on to the first layer - website. We have forked the official browser based <a href=\"https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/apps\">polkadot app</a>. Then we had to replace core functionalites like signing transactions, creating accounts or recovering them, from browser based wallet to the Snap based. For example to sign transactions inside MetaMask we changed implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/blob/ed9f12e54c9c721685692f75b78e2f3e1d8b546b/polkadot-apps/packages/react-signer/src/signers/QrSigner.ts#L20\">QrSigner</a> to use Snap <code>signTransaction</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Integrating MetaMask Snap with the polkadot app introduced two improvments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, it allowed to inherit the security model from the MetaMask extension instead of using the polkadot app wallet, which is based on local storage.</li>\n<li>Secondly, we could use MetaMask seed to create a polkadot app in a deterministic way, so whenever we export our seed, the Aleph Zero key will be also exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The MetaMask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides API calls, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user. In this case we have levarged two of them:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MeteMask. For instance we use it to store created accounts. Interacting with state is very easy and can be simplified to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript{numberLines:\" data-meta=\"true}\">const request = async (method: 'clear' | 'get' | 'update', newState?: unknown): Promise&#x3C;any> => {\nif (['get', 'clear'].includes(method) &#x26;&#x26; newState) {\n    throw new Error(`Cannot ${method} with newState`);\n}\nif (method == 'update' &#x26;&#x26; !newState) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot call update without newState');\n}\n\nconst params = newState ? [method, newState] : [method];\nreturn await wallet.request({\n    method: `snap_manageState`,\n    params,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>snap_getBip44Entropy_</code> - to get entropy from MetaMask seed. <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snap-getbip44entropy\">docs</a></p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that there exists very cool MetaMask library <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/browser-passworder\">passworder</a>, which allow us to easily encrypt and decrypt state. In our case as a symmetric key to encrypt state we have used entropy from the MetaMask seed once again.</p>\n<p><strong>The SDK</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s recap, we have hacked polkadot app by injecting some javascript here and there enabling usage of the Snap. The Snap can get entropy from the seed inside MetaMask and manage encrypted state. So the last step would be to integrate with the SDK for the Aleph Zero - <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/\">polkadotjs</a>.</p>\n<p>That seems like a easy task, just run <code>npm install @polkadot/api</code> and import it. However importing dependencies to Snap can be challening. This difficulties appears, because Snap is not evaluated directly on javascript virtual machine, it first has to be sandboxed in Secure Ecma Script (SES). In short, code which normally compile without any problems could fail when loading in <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-development-guide.html#fixing-build-eval-issues\">SES</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">Code</a></p>\n<p>When working with most of the librariers we wont have any problems, but it wasn’t case for us. We had two issues with evaluating <code>polkadotjs SDK</code> inside SES, to mitigate them we have written two scripts which were run on bundled source code.</p>\n<p>First of them was caused by incorrectly formatted wasm code embedded inside javascript file. Here is the fixing script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst dirPath =\n  '../../../../node_modules/@substrate/smoldot-light/dist/cjs/instance/autogen';\n\n// SES doesn't like double slashes in strings so we need to replace them with single slashes\n// and string concatenation.\nasync function fixDoubleSlash() {\n  const files = ['wasm0.js', 'wasm1.js', 'wasm2.js'];\n  for (const file of files) {\n    console.log('Fixing ${file}');\n    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, dirPath, file);\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');\n    let fixedContents = contents;\n    while (fixedContents.includes('//')) {\n      fixedContents = fixedContents.split('//').join('/\"+\"/');\n    }\n    await fs.writeFile(filePath, fixedContents);\n  }\n}\n\nfixDoubleSlash();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second issue was also caused, by polkadot extension, which was trying to access <code>window.addEventListener</code> method, which is forbidden in SES. It was also trivally solved with simple</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst bundlePath = path.join(__dirname, '../dist/bundle.js');\n\nasync function fix() {\n  console.log(`Fixing ${bundlePath}`);\n  const contents = await fs.readFile(bundlePath, 'utf8');\n  const replaceMissingTypes = '\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener = function(){};\\n\\n';\n\n  // Looking for a first breakline after the first line of the file\n  // This is where we can safely inject our code\n  const fixed = contents.replace('\\n\\n', replaceMissingTypes);\n  await fs.writeFile(bundlePath, fixed);\n}\n\nfix();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>We’d love to make make our snap fully compatible with polkadot.js and viable as a web wallet in Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Michael is a programmer in a Polish bank working on a daily basis with blockchain technology. He loves programming and learning new stuff.</p>\n<p>Piotr is a software engineer working in NuCypher. He’s interested in privacy, data, and distributed systems.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Piotr - Initially learned about MetaMask Snaps during Devcon in Osaka. The topic resurfaced earlier this year, shortly before EthDenver hackathon.</p>\n<p>Michaeł - Piotr introduced me to MetaMask Snaps, shortly after EthDenver.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>An ability to access application-specific cryptography/private keys in your dapp—it enables building new user flows on top of a familiar browser-wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>The basics are there, but building more sophisticated MetaMask Snaps, especially ones that require custom UI elements, is tricky. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to fit our mental model of web developer experience into Snaps - things like deployment, testing, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a tool which gives real power to the community, everyone for themself decides what features their MetaMask should have. Plugins allows to democratize development and enable faster growth.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Access to more networks (especially non-EVM ones); An ability to tap into transaction lifecycle and add custom logic (like safety checks) or customize the UX; Encrypted storage in the browser for dapp-specific sensitive content, and also an ability to “bring your own cryptography” to your users with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Compiling JS libraries in SES could be difficult, but from our experience it’s not impossible. Feedback loop in developing MetaMask is pretty long, so be sure to write unit tests.</p>\n<p>There is a small but active developers community in MetaMask Snaps - visiting Discord, GitHub discussions etc. can be very rewarding, especially that the product is still new and there is little education avalible outside this bubble.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Snapshot Snap With Minci</h3>\n<p>We chat with independent Web3 developer Minci who built the Snapshot Snap at the ETHWarsaw Hackathon—a proof-of-concept application to set up custom notifications for on-chain activities.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/746189468?h=471286f146\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/746189468\">Snapshot: Demo Video</a>  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user183087024\"></a> <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/iamminci/snapshot\">https://github.com/iamminci/snapshot</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>I find the idea of wallet notifications for on-chain events fascinating. We see it everywhere in web2 with PayPal and Venmo, but the fact that indexing makes it such a challenging feature for web3 is an interesting technical problem to think about. I wanted to try creating a proof of concept application that allows any user to set up their own custom notifications for on-chain activities. I used Metamask Snaps' implementation of notifications in order to build out my prototype.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>The technical implementation involved first setting up a notification snap by triggering an installation through a client-side application. Then, the user configures the snap to listen to the on-chain events of their preference. The vision here was that the user would be able to whitelist any contract address and their associated events such that they would prompt not only a notification but also automated on-chain actions such as sending a transaction or executing a DEX trade based on the trigger. The automated send was made possible by deriving the user’s private key from a BIP44 Address Key Deriver (shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ritave/\">Olaf</a> for his workshop using this library) such that the action would go through without an explicit confirmation from the user. My proof of concept was limited to an example of bidding on Opensea and was actualized using Opensea’s API on Rinkeby testnet.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The demo video was based on a proof of concept that only worked for a handful of pre-configured use cases (bidding on Opensea, automating a send of ether). Next steps to actualize this vision would be configuring some type of storage to be able to dynamically update the events that the snap listens to without having to re-install the notification snap. Also showcasing a dashboard for users to monitor their existing snaps and visualizing the events that were triggered in a single-view would be useful. Also, providing a much more customized range of automated trigger actions beyond just sends but enabling a set of more complex contract calls like setting limit orders or arbitraging.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask Snaps when I visited a Metam]Mask booth at the Miami Permissionless conference. The idea that this could become a plugin ecosystem for MetaMask made me really excited.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>No other wallet has customizable plugins tailored towards developers. I believe this is singular to Metamask in the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, building with MetaMask Snaps wasn’t a walk in the park. I think the lack of proper documentation was the biggest drawback. Thankfully, there were enough interesting examples to be able to derive my own innovation from those building blocks, so I could strongly recommend any developer interested in building with snaps to dive straight into the examples repo.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the obvious future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps could unlock a boundless world of possibilities in web3. Just like Chrome has now become the go-to browser with the extensions ecosystem and VSCode similarly with their own extension marketplace. I could totally see MetaMask Snaps taking MetaMask to the next level by allowing developers to onboard onto the tooling and wildly innovate to customize the wallet to their liking (and in turn, attract users who find those tools useful). An interesting tokenomics would be built around the developers who offer the most compelling MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d urge anyone interested in MetaMask Snaps to dive straight into the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">example repo</a>, fork it, and play around with it!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

This brainchild of MetaMask co-founder Kumavis simultaneously addresses security concerns in Web3 and long-standing structural security concerns in the open-source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You need to understand the security situation with JavaScript (JS for short) and its dependencies if you’re building with it.

Copay was a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet from BitPay that was the target of a supply chain hack resulting in stolen user funds. An npm dependency used by the wallet was controlled by an attacker allowing them to deploy the attack.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the fix? A couple of arguments have been made to solve this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Never use dependencies? Nah.</strong></p>\n<p>While it might be safer, are you going to give up on open source—the wealth of the commons that forms the foundations we all build on? On sharing and collaborating? If you’re trying to build something complex, do you really want to spend time recreating the wheel?</p>\n<p>Yeah, neither do we.</p>\n<p><strong>Audit all dependencies always? Nah.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a good idea, but, how many dependencies do you have? Hundreds? Thousands? Tens of thousands? It’s not practical–although if you want to perform a manual audit, LavaMoat will help you prioritize the most dangerous ones (more on that later).</p>\n<p>And even if you do have time to really look at the package of differences are you going to be able to catch a security vulnerability?</p>\n<p>Hard thing to bet on. So let’s explore a different solution:</p>\n<p><strong>LavaMoat? Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of never using dependencies or auditing all your dependencies always, let’s take a look at LavaMoat’s security kernel that wraps packages in compartments and only gives them access to what they need.</p>\n<p>Because, remember, in order for malicious code to attack your system, it needs permission to do so. <strong>LavaMoat's kernel goes through the third-party code that you’re pulling into your project, determines what the dependencies need to run, and gives those dependencies <em>only that</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat is currently protecting tens of millions of users at MetaMask and runs at three different times during each development process: Installation of dependencies, build, and runtime.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/51M5XNOgDQqykaDpdN9svC/5a255f2bf943d029c01329b940219634/Screen_Shot_2022-10-13_at_11.27.15_AM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 11.27.15 AM\"></p>\n<p>To put things into perspective, check out this dependency graph visualization dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3xeNJrFYj61ibxvjVMOI9Q/41ac5b6653762a5575a27299c4cf56a1/Screen_Shot_2022-10-13_at_11.28.26_AM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"lavamoat npm-viz\"></p>\n<p>The list of your dependencies are on the left and the graph is depicted as a neural network on the right.

I have been a bitcoiner since 2013 and my team started building hardware wallets in late 2017. We spent over three and a half years improving Bitcoin security and then started to work on Ethereum &amp; Web3 from mid 2021. Keystone became one of the hardware wallet partners of MetaMask. Together, we proudly brought QR-code air-gapped signing to the Ethereum &amp; Web3 community.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask in mid 2020. The MetaMask team was very enthusiastic about security and insightful about the benefits of QR-code air-gapped signing. Not long after we started working on Ethereum &amp; Web3, we started to work with the MetaMask team on a hardware wallet integration. When we first noticed MetaMask Flask (Snaps) in early 2022, we strongly felt that it would be huge in the near future. Since we came from the Bitcoin community, it was pretty natural for us to contribute to Bitcoin Snaps using MetaMask Flask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re very enthusiastic about security. Every wallet provider cares about security but not all of them put enough resources into it. The MetaMask’s founders themselves are also deeply into security and they initiated great projects like MobyMask and LavaMoat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Openness. When we were working on adding QR code air-gapped signing to MetaMask extension as well as the mobile application, the MetaMask team was very responsive during the integration and a great joy to work with. When we were working on the Bitcoin Snaps, the Snaps team also had really quick turn-arounds to add APIs or any other requests.</p>\n<p>Responsibility. As we closely worked with MetaMask, we strongly felt that the MetaMask team took the whole of Web3 development as their own responsibility. This mindset deeply differentiated MetaMask from other software wallets as it helps them see things long-term and make decisions that are best for the community.</p>\n<p>Snaps opens the possibility to let more than 30 million users seamlessly manage their Bitcoin. We are super proud we are part of this great milestone for Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>We strongly feel that if Web3 is going to grow as big as Web2, MetaMask could be the “operating system” of Web3. Thus, MetaMask Snaps is basically the pioneer for that purpose.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dietrich Ayala, IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PSSWeGkp30A-a2UWQFpImdNL1Fbo4oqgC5nhwhTRoQiY41h5Yaer4j1fyuVxrHtlOyVCfCOsOj-8JP8EwrGbfa0aNV3qbeWH1TkVOmxwBC9Ovta2fJs3Xpf6GugChwBGxS_HCwZRJm1NGYL9iKR_tJw\" width=\"161\" height=\"161\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your company?</strong></p>\n<p>My name is Dietrich Ayala, and I'm IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs. A lot of my job is getting IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p working in new and weird places where it currently isn't&nbsp; — from web browsers to IoT to satellites in space. Protocol Labs is where each of those technologies were born, and is now one of many stewards and developers involved in their care and feeding. We are continually working on research and development to radically improve the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Probably late 2017 or 2018... I was working at Mozilla and had a side project called <a href=\"https://github.com/libdweb/libdweb\">libdweb</a>, which added extension APIs to enable browsers to be full participants in p2p networks and blockchains, and I'd run a <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/\">series of articles</a> on Mozilla Hacks. Dipping my toe in the water with these initiatives introduced me to a number of projects in the broader crypto/blockchain space (not yet widely referred to as Web3!), including MetaMask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent over a decade building browsers and evangelizing the web, so MetaMask is special to me in that it's been continually focused on the web as a tier 1 platform and pushed against its limits. The web must change and adapt to meet new user needs, and MetaMask's commitment to it will help make that change happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>We've been lucky to work with both MetaMask and Chainsafe on the FIL Snap. It's been challenging and fun to be part of something new and unproven, and which really lets developers like us do more for our communities through a tool they already use and are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>It's exciting to see a direction towards further extensibility - MetaMask as a platform makes sense, and removes a lot of the constraints that come from being EVM-centric.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>It'll lower the barriers to building dapps with Filecoin, and we're excited to see where that goes. It brings the low-barrier-to-entry for end-user apps on the web to so many new and different blockchain ecosystems that I expect we'll see new applications we could not have foreseen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Flask out and build their own Snap?</strong></p>\n<p>Try to build a basic dapp using one of the Snaps... but that's only half done. Then go share your feedback with MetaMask!</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"hi-IN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"डेवलपर्स","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamasks-community-at-the-core-of-its-growth/","isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/hi-IN/news/developers/page/16/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/security/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":60,"categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","category":"developers","totalItems":67,"currentPage":16,"totalPages":17,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"सपोर्ट नहीं करता है। कृपया ऐसा ब्राउज़र डाउनलोड करें जो MetaMask को सपोर्ट करता हो।","by":"के द्वारा","copyLink":"लिंक कॉपी करें","copied":"कॉपी किया गया!"},"slug":"/news/developers/page/16/","translation":true,"locale":"hi-IN","node_locale":"hi-IN","newsCategories":[{"name":"security","categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","total":33},{"name":"","categoryId":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","total":68},{"name":"institutions","categoryId":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","total":50},{"name":"developers","categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","total":67}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2087975078","2272059946","3000541721","3155062165"],"slicesMap":{}}
