As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Revoke Snap with Swix Jedi and Adrian</h3>\n<p>We chat with Web3 developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swixJedi\">Swix Jedi</a> and Adrian who built the Revoke Snap at the ETHWarsaw Hackathon.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3_Okkp8NHw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/SwixJedi/revokesnap\">https://github.com/SwixJedi/revokesnap</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>In order to ensure security of token usage by external actors, ERC20 token standards implement an allowance, where the owner of the token needs to approve an actor (i.e. DEX smart contract) to be able to utilize its tokens up to a chosen limit.</p>\n<p>In order to enhance the somewhat clunky DeFi user experience, many of the DeFi protocols use a max unit 256 value for approvals in order for the user not to have to approve tokens and spend their money on unnecessary gas fees each time they want to interact with their contracts.</p>\n<p>Especially for active DeFi users that can easily create a situation when after using said protocols there are some leftover approvals, which is a potential security threat.</p>\n<p>While there are existing solutions to help users tackle the leftover allowance, only some of them offer approvals directly from the user interface. The process is time consuming as each approval needs to be addressed individually and manually confirmed. While this approach is secure it requires a lot of continuous, manual user interaction.</p>\n<p>This is what pointed us towards an unaddressed niche where we could leverage the MetaMask Snaps capabilities, to make things better.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>We decided to leverage the following benefits of MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to all accounts in Metamask</li>\n<li>Ability to perform complex operations using a single approval from a user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To propose a solution for this problem, which in the future should make it possible to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present only one user prompt to get access to all current and future accounts (with notable exception of hardware wallets)</li>\n<li>Revoke all approvals from all current accounts in batch, with no need for separate confirmations and accounts switching</li>\n<li>Actively monitor all user accounts (including those on hardware wallets) for new approvals and display notification to the user when detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On installing the Revoke Snap through the web UI, MetaMask will prompt for needed permissions.</p>\n<p>All permissions are specified in a <code>snap.manifest.json</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\"initialPermissions\": {\n    \"snap_confirm\": {},\n    \"snap_getBip44Entropy_60\": {},\n    \"snap_notify\": {},\n    \"endowment:long-running\": {}\n  },\n</code></pre>\n<p>Two permissions worth noting here are:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Control your “Ethereum” accounts and assets.</strong>\nThis means that to function, our snap requires users parent key (secret key) from MetaMask in order to be able to generate accounts and sign transactions on behalf of the user.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Run indefinitely</strong>\nWhile Revoke Snap is not an implementation that is meant to run in the background continuously, settling transactions on blockchain takes time and MetaMask Snaps do have a built in kill-switch after 60s, which can not be enough to finalize the transactions. This permission allows RevokeSnap to go around that security measure.</p>\n<p>After receiving the necessary permissions RevokeSnap will generate a number of accounts out of the user's private key:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n// Get chosen amount of wallets (signers) from provider (in this case Metamask)\nexport async function getSigners(provider: ethers.providers.Provider, amount: number): Promise&#x3C;Wallet[]> {\n    let wallets: Wallet[] = [];\n\n    for (let i=0; i&#x3C;amount; i++) {\n        wallets.push(await getSigner(provider, i));\n    }\n\n    return wallets;\n}\n\n// Exctract addresses out of wallets\nexport function getAddresses(wallets: Wallet[]): string[] {\n    let addresses: string[] = [];\n\n    for (let i=0; i&#x3C;wallets.length; i++) {\n        addresses.push(wallets[i].address);\n    }\n\n    return addresses;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n// Fetch parent key from Metamask and generate a wallet from it, base on the input index\nexport async function getSigner(provider: ethers.providers.Provider, index: number): Promise&#x3C;Wallet> {\n    // Metamask uses default HD derivation path\n    // https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/importing-a-seed-phrase-from-another-wallet-software-derivation-path/\n    const ethereumNode = (await wallet.request({\n      method: 'snap_getBip44Entropy_60',\n    })) as unknown as BIP44CoinTypeNode;\n    const deriveEthereumAccount = await getBIP44AddressKeyDeriver(ethereumNode);\n    // A bug:\n    // The current public version of @metamask/key-tree's derive function returns the private key and chain code in a single buffer\n    // Ether.js also accepts a 64 byte buffer without errors and returns wrong keys\n    // Related issue: https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/2926\n    // TODO(ritave): Update to newest key-tree when available and use deriveEthereumAccount(0).privateKey\n    const mainAccountKey = (await deriveEthereumAccount(index)).privateKey;\n    return new Wallet(mainAccountKey, provider);\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then perform a check for leftover approvals and, once the search is complete, expose a button to revoke all identified approvals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4eMGL5OTIo5lvvahzoJzBO/2edd3473ae0f0d836b33cd7f4ff97288/Screen_Shot_2022-11-07_at_3.54.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 3.54.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>On the click of the “Revoke All” button the Snap will issue a series of transactions corresponding to the leftover approval to zero them out one by one. As the Snap already is in possession of the generated wallets private keys this does not require any additional confirmation from the user, beyond the initial one.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>As during the hackathon there was only a limited amount of time to create the most optimum solutions, we utilized a number of functional implementations which have room for improvement.</p>\n<p>For starters, currently the number of accounts generated in the snap is passed as a function parameter and hard-coded as 3. A better option could be for the snap to use an external API (or a dedicated backend) to verify the next transaction nonce on each account for a given chosen chain(s) and only take into account addresses with the nonce number greater than 0.</p>\n<p>Moreover for approvals we used a short list of known addresses of tokens and actors to showcase the functionality, but optimally the approval check should be done more globally. This could be done, i.e. by using an RPC provider API (such as <a href=\"https://infura.io/\">Infura</a>) to find all approval transactions and parse them to display on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m Jedi, I work as a Lead Developer at Swix. I have been in crypto since 2017, and since 2019 I fell down the rabbit hole and started working with DeFi protocols, mostly on the Smart Contract side. With Swix I’m currently working on bridging the real estate yields on-chain and bringing new users into the crypto space.</p>\n<p>I’m Adrian, I’ve worked as a software developer and architect for small startups and big companies. Blockchain has been my main area of interest for many years, particularly the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>During the development of the Revoke Snap we split the work so that Jedi focused on working out how MetaMask Snaps work and setting up necessary basics for the Smart Contact interactions required within our Snap, while Adrian handled the web UI and bundling of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>We were first introduced to MetaMask Snaps during ETHWarsaw’s presentation, which was quite technical and encompassed more in-depth under the hood workings of the protocol. This triggered us to research the topic some more, and well, here we are.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I mean… the idea itself. MetaMask Snaps breaks out of the standard accepted within the non-custodial browser wallet extensions landscape which is that every transaction, while interacting with web3 applications, needs to be individually approved by the user. Also the functionality of wallets is limited to the functionality the team behind it decides to implement.</p>\n<p>What MetaMask Snaps brings to the table is a platform enabling the bottom-up creation of native wallet integrations for arbitrary blockchain interactions, which carries a lot of resemblance to the mobile app stores.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space? What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest value adds for the crypto space coming from MetaMask Snaps is smoothing of the UX in the crypto and DeFi protocols. Whether that would be enabling bundling transactions, 1-click approval for all transactions made within one dApp, allowing for direct contract interactions while executing credit card-to-crypto purchases or some other even more creative solution, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>It is our strong belief that, especially for the new crypto users, abstracting away the complexity and clunkiness of blockchain interactions can be a game changer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>A big motivator while building Revoke Snap was that MetaMask Snaps are still in development and thus the experimentation we do right now can have a tangible impact on where MetaMask, MetaMask Snaps and, through it to an extent, the crypto space will go. It was a good experience to be able to add our brick to the future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>For any devs looking to try MetaMask Snaps out — have a go at it. MetaMask Snaps are pretty straight forward to start with using the available github template repository and the MetaMask team is very helpful as well. The concept itself has a big potential and there isn’t so much that has been done with it already, so it’s easy to provide a value add.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

On the other hand, integrating with MetaMask Snaps could help onboard an existing population of web3 users to Aleph Zero network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Adapter</strong></p>\n<p>Our snap is composed from two parts. First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the snap is a server and the website is the client. To reflect this natural boundary we have extracted snap API to a separate package named <code>adapter</code>. It exposes all possible methods the website may use to interact with the snap. Such a layer of abstraction, ease usage of the Snap by other clients (websites). Our API can be described by four methods, which names are pretty self-explanatory. If u want to deep dive, here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">code</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const getAccountFromSeed = async (seed: string): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccountFromSeed\", [seed]);\n}\n\nexport const generateNewAccount = async (): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"generateNewAccount\", []);\n}\n\nexport const signTransaction = async (transaction: SignerPayloadJSON): Promise&#x3C;{ signature: string }> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"signTransaction\", [transaction as unknown as string]);\n}\n\nexport const getAccounts = async (): Promise&#x3C;string[]> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccounts\", []);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The app</strong></p>\n<p>So, we explained the glue between our layers, let’s move on to the first layer - website. We have forked the official browser based <a href=\"https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/apps\">polkadot app</a>. Then we had to replace core functionalites like signing transactions, creating accounts or recovering them, from browser based wallet to the Snap based. For example to sign transactions inside MetaMask we changed implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/blob/ed9f12e54c9c721685692f75b78e2f3e1d8b546b/polkadot-apps/packages/react-signer/src/signers/QrSigner.ts#L20\">QrSigner</a> to use Snap <code>signTransaction</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Integrating MetaMask Snap with the polkadot app introduced two improvments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, it allowed to inherit the security model from the MetaMask extension instead of using the polkadot app wallet, which is based on local storage.</li>\n<li>Secondly, we could use MetaMask seed to create a polkadot app in a deterministic way, so whenever we export our seed, the Aleph Zero key will be also exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The MetaMask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides API calls, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user. In this case we have levarged two of them:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MeteMask. For instance we use it to store created accounts. Interacting with state is very easy and can be simplified to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript{numberLines:\" data-meta=\"true}\">const request = async (method: 'clear' | 'get' | 'update', newState?: unknown): Promise&#x3C;any> => {\nif (['get', 'clear'].includes(method) &#x26;&#x26; newState) {\n    throw new Error(`Cannot ${method} with newState`);\n}\nif (method == 'update' &#x26;&#x26; !newState) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot call update without newState');\n}\n\nconst params = newState ? [method, newState] : [method];\nreturn await wallet.request({\n    method: `snap_manageState`,\n    params,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>snap_getBip44Entropy_</code> - to get entropy from MetaMask seed. <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snap-getbip44entropy\">docs</a></p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that there exists very cool MetaMask library <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/browser-passworder\">passworder</a>, which allow us to easily encrypt and decrypt state. In our case as a symmetric key to encrypt state we have used entropy from the MetaMask seed once again.</p>\n<p><strong>The SDK</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s recap, we have hacked polkadot app by injecting some javascript here and there enabling usage of the Snap. The Snap can get entropy from the seed inside MetaMask and manage encrypted state. So the last step would be to integrate with the SDK for the Aleph Zero - <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/\">polkadotjs</a>.</p>\n<p>That seems like a easy task, just run <code>npm install @polkadot/api</code> and import it. However importing dependencies to Snap can be challening. This difficulties appears, because Snap is not evaluated directly on javascript virtual machine, it first has to be sandboxed in Secure Ecma Script (SES). In short, code which normally compile without any problems could fail when loading in <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-development-guide.html#fixing-build-eval-issues\">SES</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">Code</a></p>\n<p>When working with most of the librariers we wont have any problems, but it wasn’t case for us. We had two issues with evaluating <code>polkadotjs SDK</code> inside SES, to mitigate them we have written two scripts which were run on bundled source code.</p>\n<p>First of them was caused by incorrectly formatted wasm code embedded inside javascript file. Here is the fixing script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst dirPath =\n  '../../../../node_modules/@substrate/smoldot-light/dist/cjs/instance/autogen';\n\n// SES doesn't like double slashes in strings so we need to replace them with single slashes\n// and string concatenation.\nasync function fixDoubleSlash() {\n  const files = ['wasm0.js', 'wasm1.js', 'wasm2.js'];\n  for (const file of files) {\n    console.log('Fixing ${file}');\n    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, dirPath, file);\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');\n    let fixedContents = contents;\n    while (fixedContents.includes('//')) {\n      fixedContents = fixedContents.split('//').join('/\"+\"/');\n    }\n    await fs.writeFile(filePath, fixedContents);\n  }\n}\n\nfixDoubleSlash();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second issue was also caused, by polkadot extension, which was trying to access <code>window.addEventListener</code> method, which is forbidden in SES. It was also trivally solved with simple</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst bundlePath = path.join(__dirname, '../dist/bundle.js');\n\nasync function fix() {\n  console.log(`Fixing ${bundlePath}`);\n  const contents = await fs.readFile(bundlePath, 'utf8');\n  const replaceMissingTypes = '\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener = function(){};\\n\\n';\n\n  // Looking for a first breakline after the first line of the file\n  // This is where we can safely inject our code\n  const fixed = contents.replace('\\n\\n', replaceMissingTypes);\n  await fs.writeFile(bundlePath, fixed);\n}\n\nfix();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>We’d love to make make our snap fully compatible with polkadot.js and viable as a web wallet in Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Michael is a programmer in a Polish bank working on a daily basis with blockchain technology. He loves programming and learning new stuff.</p>\n<p>Piotr is a software engineer working in NuCypher. He’s interested in privacy, data, and distributed systems.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Piotr - Initially learned about MetaMask Snaps during Devcon in Osaka. The topic resurfaced earlier this year, shortly before EthDenver hackathon.</p>\n<p>Michaeł - Piotr introduced me to MetaMask Snaps, shortly after EthDenver.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>An ability to access application-specific cryptography/private keys in your dapp—it enables building new user flows on top of a familiar browser-wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>The basics are there, but building more sophisticated MetaMask Snaps, especially ones that require custom UI elements, is tricky. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to fit our mental model of web developer experience into Snaps - things like deployment, testing, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a tool which gives real power to the community, everyone for themself decides what features their MetaMask should have. Plugins allows to democratize development and enable faster growth.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Access to more networks (especially non-EVM ones); An ability to tap into transaction lifecycle and add custom logic (like safety checks) or customize the UX; Encrypted storage in the browser for dapp-specific sensitive content, and also an ability to “bring your own cryptography” to your users with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Compiling JS libraries in SES could be difficult, but from our experience it’s not impossible. Feedback loop in developing MetaMask is pretty long, so be sure to write unit tests.</p>\n<p>There is a small but active developers community in MetaMask Snaps - visiting Discord, GitHub discussions etc. can be very rewarding, especially that the product is still new and there is little education avalible outside this bubble.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

We see it everywhere in web2 with PayPal and Venmo, but the fact that indexing makes it such a challenging feature for web3 is an interesting technical problem to think about. I wanted to try creating a proof of concept application that allows any user to set up their own custom notifications for on-chain activities. I used Metamask Snaps' implementation of notifications in order to build out my prototype.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>The technical implementation involved first setting up a notification snap by triggering an installation through a client-side application. Then, the user configures the snap to listen to the on-chain events of their preference. The vision here was that the user would be able to whitelist any contract address and their associated events such that they would prompt not only a notification but also automated on-chain actions such as sending a transaction or executing a DEX trade based on the trigger. The automated send was made possible by deriving the user’s private key from a BIP44 Address Key Deriver (shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ritave/\">Olaf</a> for his workshop using this library) such that the action would go through without an explicit confirmation from the user. My proof of concept was limited to an example of bidding on Opensea and was actualized using Opensea’s API on Rinkeby testnet.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The demo video was based on a proof of concept that only worked for a handful of pre-configured use cases (bidding on Opensea, automating a send of ether). Next steps to actualize this vision would be configuring some type of storage to be able to dynamically update the events that the snap listens to without having to re-install the notification snap. Also showcasing a dashboard for users to monitor their existing snaps and visualizing the events that were triggered in a single-view would be useful. Also, providing a much more customized range of automated trigger actions beyond just sends but enabling a set of more complex contract calls like setting limit orders or arbitraging.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask Snaps when I visited a Metam]Mask booth at the Miami Permissionless conference. The idea that this could become a plugin ecosystem for MetaMask made me really excited.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>No other wallet has customizable plugins tailored towards developers. I believe this is singular to Metamask in the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, building with MetaMask Snaps wasn’t a walk in the park. I think the lack of proper documentation was the biggest drawback. Thankfully, there were enough interesting examples to be able to derive my own innovation from those building blocks, so I could strongly recommend any developer interested in building with snaps to dive straight into the examples repo.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the obvious future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps could unlock a boundless world of possibilities in web3. Just like Chrome has now become the go-to browser with the extensions ecosystem and VSCode similarly with their own extension marketplace. I could totally see MetaMask Snaps taking MetaMask to the next level by allowing developers to onboard onto the tooling and wildly innovate to customize the wallet to their liking (and in turn, attract users who find those tools useful). An interesting tokenomics would be built around the developers who offer the most compelling MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d urge anyone interested in MetaMask Snaps to dive straight into the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">example repo</a>, fork it, and play around with it!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

This brainchild of MetaMask co-founder Kumavis simultaneously addresses security concerns in Web3 and long-standing structural security concerns in the open-source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>You need to understand the security situation with JavaScript (JS for short) and its dependencies if you’re building with it. JS engineers rarely build an app \"from scratch\"; they generally import existing pieces of code, usually called \"dependencies\", into their project to use like building blocks. That's great for collaboration and development speed, but what if malicious code is included in one of those dependencies?</p>\n<p>Software supply chain security involves everything that touches an application (like dependencies) or plays a role in its development (like build tools or CI systems). JavaScript is <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies\">the most popular language for developers</a> by far and is also very prone to supply chain attacks. This <a href=\"https://www.sonatype.com/resources/vulnerability-timeline\">vulnerability timeline</a> from 2017 shows a solid half of the attacks originating from <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a>, a popular source for open-source JS packages:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6Y1CnwisIUFXXRAMV4oq13/903af7faa7f0142eddbd6d23894264c8/Screen_Shot_2022-10-10_at_10.41.53_PM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"vulnerability timeline\">Source: SonaType</p>\n<p>JavaScript is targeted due to its:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Popularity:</strong> It’s used on the front-end and the back-end</li>\n<li><strong>Ambient authority:</strong> If you’re running JavaScript somewhere you have access to a lot of powers, like network access</li>\n<li><strong>Mutability:</strong> Everything is changeable by default</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpays-copay-wallet-compromised-by-malicious-code-firm-issues-advice-for-users\">Copay Wallet Hack</a> of 2018 got Kumavis interested in solving this problem and is the primary case study for designing LavaMoat. Copay was a self-custodial Bitcoin wallet from BitPay that was the target of a supply chain hack resulting in stolen user funds. An npm dependency used by the wallet was controlled by an attacker allowing them to deploy the attack.</p>\n<p>So, what’s the fix? A couple of arguments have been made to solve this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Never use dependencies? Nah.</strong></p>\n<p>While it might be safer, are you going to give up on open source—the wealth of the commons that forms the foundations we all build on? On sharing and collaborating? If you’re trying to build something complex, do you really want to spend time recreating the wheel?</p>\n<p>Yeah, neither do we.</p>\n<p><strong>Audit all dependencies always? Nah.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a good idea, but, how many dependencies do you have? Hundreds? Thousands? Tens of thousands? It’s not practical–although if you want to perform a manual audit, LavaMoat will help you prioritize the most dangerous ones (more on that later).</p>\n<p>And even if you do have time to really look at the package of differences are you going to be able to catch a security vulnerability?</p>\n<p>Hard thing to bet on. So let’s explore a different solution:</p>\n<p><strong>LavaMoat? Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of never using dependencies or auditing all your dependencies always, let’s take a look at LavaMoat’s security kernel that wraps packages in compartments and only gives them access to what they need.</p>\n<p>Because, remember, in order for malicious code to attack your system, it needs permission to do so. <strong>LavaMoat's kernel goes through the third-party code that you’re pulling into your project, determines what the dependencies need to run, and gives those dependencies <em>only that</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat is currently protecting tens of millions of users at MetaMask and runs at three different times during each development process: Installation of dependencies, build, and runtime.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/51M5XNOgDQqykaDpdN9svC/5a255f2bf943d029c01329b940219634/Screen_Shot_2022-10-13_at_11.27.15_AM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 11.27.15 AM\"></p>\n<p>To put things into perspective, check out this dependency graph visualization dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3xeNJrFYj61ibxvjVMOI9Q/41ac5b6653762a5575a27299c4cf56a1/Screen_Shot_2022-10-13_at_11.28.26_AM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"lavamoat npm-viz\"></p>\n<p>The list of your dependencies are on the left and the graph is depicted as a neural network on the right. The colors are based on a heuristic of dangerousness: for example, the green ones don’t import any powerful platform APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>The idea here is to help you prioritize auditing your dependencies.</strong></p>\n<p>So how do you implement this?</p>\n<p>Taking the three development phases into account:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install: @lavamoat/allow-scripts</li>\n<li>Build: lavamoat-node</li>\n<li>Runtime: lavamoat-x plugin for your bundler</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that should act as a moat for malicious code.</p>\n<h3>Building software at scale</h3>\n<p>If you’re interested in helping us, LavaMoat is open-source! We are trying to get plugins for as many bundlers as possible and want to make it easier to review policies and add tight lockdowns when giving network access to packages.
