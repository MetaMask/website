MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is the result of years of research to make secure and easy-to-use tools for the web3 ecosystem. The toolkit is designed to solve significant UX problems that prevent mainstream web3 adoption &#x26; offers tools to unlock new social coordination use-cases. The Red Balloon was a social strategy game played at the EthCC conference in Brussels from July 7th to 9th, 2024. Participants experienced instant onboarding, cost-effective gas sponsorship, and multi-hop delegations for the first time in a web3 game.</p>\n<p>The goal of the challenge was to find 10 balloons scattered throughout the conference venue and win 5 ETH as the prize. However, due to the geographical and temporal distribution of the balloons, it was impossible for a single player to find all 10 balloons independently. This game was inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Network_Challenge\">DARPA Network challenge</a> and simulates a difficult large-scope problem that requires decentralized collaboration to solve.</p>\n<p>The first person to collect all 10 balloons and claim the win took home the prize money minus any commissions for people whose balloons were used for the win.</p>\n<p>This case study discusses how the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/introducing-the-delegation-toolkit-metamask-smart-contract-account-offering/\">MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</a> made each feature of the Red Balloon game possible.</p>\n<h2>Scan to play: featuring instant web3 onboarding</h2>\n<p>One of the main features of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is the ability for users to bypass the typical web3 wallet connection flow, eliminating the need to install a traditional wallet or worry about seed phrases.</p>\n<p>For Red Balloon, players onboard the game by scanning a QR code from either a physical balloon or another player who has already onboarded the game. This generates a counterfactual (free and instant) embedded smart account for them in the game web app, after which they can get straight to playing without thinking of creating or connecting a wallet, on-ramping, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/30xLTWrV2sNdQPKan4CIhd/d488393d44f93179dff3941af84136ec/image3.gif\" alt=\"Game UI GIF\"></p>\n<h2>Collect and share balloons: featuring off-chain delegations</h2>\n<p>Each balloon in the game was represented by a unique NFT smart contract assigned to a delegator account. This delegator account could issue delegations to players who discovered the corresponding physical balloon, allowing them to assign themselves as holders to claim a win. Here are the two types of delegations we implemented:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delegations from the delegator account</strong>: This allowed a player to receive a special delegation from the delegator account when they found a physical balloon. This delegation then granted the player permission to assign themselves as the balloon holder, which was required to call the win function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delegations from peers</strong>: Players could also create offers to other players, specifying the balloons they had access to and the commission they required for another player to use that balloon to claim a win. These were off-chain offers, allowing them to be free and instant.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the delegator account is entirely embedded within the game experience, playing the game did not require players to review any confirmations, making this an interruption-free experience.</p>\n<h2>Claim to win: featuring gas-sponsored batched transactions</h2>\n<p>To win the game, a player needed to be assigned all 10 balloons either by peers or directly from the delegator account before they could call the win function. The first player to achieve this condition was declared the winner and received the prize money, minus any commissions owed to other players who shared their balloon access with the winner.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit ensured that the off-chain agreements between players were programmatically enforced. When a player accepted an offer and used the shared balloons to win the game, the commissions were automatically distributed to the respective balloon owners in an atomically batched transaction.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this was at no cost to the winner and owners of the balloons, as the game featured gas sponsorship. The only time gas costs incurred were for the batched transaction<a href=\"https://lineascan.build/tx/0x04b4f192c6404ea6660f5ea47e7171472254ca42037ce25236ab9445a098fd6a\"> (transaction hash) </a>of claim win, which included the deployment of the winner’s smart account &#x26; transfers to those who won commissions. For a game that engaged <strong>621 players</strong>, we had to pay only <strong>57 cents in gas sponsorship,</strong> which delivered a gas-free end-to-end experience for all users. This feature provides a growth strategy for developers who want a cost-effective way to sponsor gas fees for their users, ensuring a seamless experience without worrying about transaction costs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//downloads.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/C7ozKpT2JT6qQ9a7YYPVf/47ab6c89c691c6e76c688ad313345a4d/image1.gif\" alt=\"image1\"></p>\n<h2>Building better UX in web3</h2>\n<p>Through the innovative design and practical use of the Delegation Toolkit, the Red Balloon game brings a complex concept to life, allowing players to experience the potential of decentralized coordination and programmatically enforced agreements while offering a seamless onboarding and gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>This demonstration not only highlights the unique capabilities of the Delegation Toolkit but also offers EthCC participants a glimpse into the future of web3 UX.

There are too many steps a developer must consider for their users before launching a dapp or a protocol. For example, users must first download a browser extension or mobile wallet, generate a wallet address, and write down seed phrases before connecting to a dapp. Additionally, to make a simple transaction such as buying a token, users must confirm pop-ups for every interaction, figure out how to pay for gas fees, and ensure they’re signing the correct transaction. This user experience is simply not streamlined enough for the average person.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine abstracting all this friction and complexity away and enabling users to get started to use dapps with only a few clicks and no installations.

The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is currently available on any EVM chain supported by a User Operation Bundler, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Linea, Optimism, and Polygon.</p>\n<h2>Unique features of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The Delegation Toolkit stands out from existing smart wallet offerings because of our permissions-first, consent-based communication approach between dapps and wallets, enabled by the <a href=\"https://github.com/metamask/delegation-framework/\">Delegation Framework</a>. The Delegation Framework, unique to the Delegation Toolkit, is a set of comprehensively audited, open source and extensible smart contracts that collectively manage the delegation lifecycle, from delegator account creation to caveat enforcement, delegation storage, and redemption.</p>\n<p>Delegation, in this context, refers to the ability of an account owner (the delegator) to grant permission to another smart contract account or externally owned account (the delegate) to perform specific actions on the delegator's behalf. The delegator can apply rules and restrictions, also known as caveats, to delegations, describing what actions the delegate can perform and to what extent. For example, Alice delegates the ability to spend her USDC to Bob, limiting the amount of spendable USDC to 100. Bob can also redelegate permissions that have been delegated to him, creating a chain of delegations across trusted parties.</p>\n<p>This approach emphasizes permissions over confirmations, allowing users to craft customizable and modular permissions that enable dapps to streamline routine web3 operations like signing confirmations or reducing the number of dapp to wallet switches with an entirely embedded web3 experience. These permissions can also be used by dapps to carry out operations on the user’s behalf, even when the user is not connected to the dapp.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/X3XdMDJiHHDE6K3TL1hCX/03a33c66d0b7da6e1c1017baafd4e3b9/Introducing_the_Delegation_Toolkit-_MetaMask_Smart_Account_Offering_2__1_.png\" alt=\"Image red ballon\"></p>\n<h2>How the Delegation Toolkit improves common web3 activities</h2>\n<br />\n<p>MetaMask Delegation Toolkit allows developers to build seamless, elegant web3 experiences and create innovative use cases never seen before. Here are some ways it improves common day-to-day web3 activities for users and developers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Simplified onboarding process</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit allows developers to build a user flow that bypasses the typical web3 wallet connection flow, meaning no extension wallet or mobile app is required. Users will not have to worry about seed phrases or confirmation screens when they get started out in web3. Dapps can now offer flexible authentication methods such as passkeys, EOA signers, social logins, and email logins to quickly onboard users according to their security preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Unlock new web3 experiences</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit enables new capabilities previously unattainable in web3 by enabling large-scale peer-to-peer social coordination with incentive structures that do not require users to connect their accounts to your dapp. This open-sourced, modular, and backward-compatible toolkit allows you to customize and enhance your dapp for viral growth, enabling new user experiences such as recurring subscription payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal in-dapp user interruptions</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit allows developers to eliminate repetitive confirmations, pop-ups, and dapp-to-wallet switches. Developers can now abstract away gas fees for their users by covering the cost or assigning them to a third party while automating precisely how many clicks users take.</li>\n<li><strong>Build for the largest and most active web3 user base</strong>: With MetaMask’s millions of monthly active users, you can onboard new users to your dapp with minimal friction while continuing to create user-friendly and feature-rich experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplify your smart contract development process</strong>: Eliminate the need for custom delegation code in your contract. Let our flexible and general-purpose framework handle the complexities, allowing you to focus on your dapp's core logic and achieve up to a 95% reduction in smart contract code.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Sign up for the preview</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is still in gated alpha, so access is limited.

In 9 months since the launch, we’ve seen 55 Snaps developed by 3rd party developers, listed in our <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/\">official directory</a>, and over 900k installs across all Snaps.</p>\n<p>As we continue to find ways to make building Snaps and extending MetaMask more seamless for developers, we’ve identified 2 key areas and have shipped some important new updates, which we’ll discuss further in this blog post.</p>\n<h2>1. Reduced audit requirements for allow-listing in the Snaps directory</h2>\n<br />\nPublishing a third-party Snap just got simpler. Before now, developers needed to complete an audit before submitting any Snap to the allowlist to be included in the Snaps registry. Today, we’re relaxing this rule so that Snaps that do not do key management( [entropy API](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip32entropy)) can now be submitted to the allowlist without a security audit and distributed through our channel.  \n<p>It is important to note that we will still require third-party security audits for Snaps that do key management. Key management or entropy APIs are those APIs that are used to manage blockchain accounts on the user’s behalf. Such APIs includes <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip32entropy\">snap_getBip32Entropy</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip44entropy\">snap_getBip44Entropy</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getentropy\">snap_getEntropy</a>. If you use these APIs and want to learn how to prepare your Snap for a third-party security audit, check out this blog on <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/5-security-audit-tips-from-msq-snap-and-consensys-diligence/\">5 Security Audit Tips from MSQ Snap and Consensys Diligence</a>.</p>\n<p>As of today, allow-listing is still a manual process. We check if a Snap needs an audit when submitted for the allowlist, and if not, we will proceed with submitting it to the registry. All Snaps require two approvals from the Snaps team before they can be allowed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a subset of third-party Snaps can now be installed by anyone without inclusion on our allowlist permissionlessly. Snaps that rely only on “open” permissions from the following list do not need to be allow-listed before they can be installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>endowment:cronjob</li>\n<li>endowment:ethereum-provider</li>\n<li>endowment:lifecycle-hooks</li>\n<li>endowment:page-home</li>\n<li>endowment:signature-insight</li>\n<li>endowment:transaction-insight</li>\n<li>snap_dialog</li>\n<li>snap_getLocale</li>\n<li>snap_manageState</li>\n<li>Snap_notify</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We still encourage developers to get third-party security audits for their Snaps even if not required for allowlisting. Also, allow-listing is still required for Snaps to appear in the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io\">Snaps Directory</a>.</p>\n<h2>2. Seamless auto-connection for selected dapps</h2>\n<br />\nDevelopers can now specify a list of dapps with auto-connection privileges with their Snap. This means that for specific dapps, when the dapp calls `wallet_requestSnaps`, users would no longer need to confirm a connection manually, and the dapp can check if the Snap is installed seamlessly. This is especially useful for Snaps that are used by multiple dapps as it allows for the following UX flow:\n<ul>\n<li>You build a Snap for use by one or more dapps and authorize an automatic connection to your Snap's companion dapp by listing it in the <code>initialConnections</code> configuration option.</li>\n<li>A user installs your Snap while interacting with a dapp that uses it.</li>\n<li>The user lands on your Snap's companion dapp.</li>\n<li>Your companion dapp can immediately identify that the Snap has already been installed.</li>\n<li>The user can interact with the companion dapp without connecting to the Snap manually.</li>\n<li>This can be extended to your trusted known dapps of choice that integrates your Snap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/linea-voyager-snap\">Linea Voyager Snap</a> currently uses this feature, and you can see the seamless connection by installing the Linea Voyager Snap from the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/consensys/linea-voyager/\">Snaps Directory</a> and visiting the <a href=\"https://voyager-snap.linea.build/\">Linea Voyager companion dapp</a>. Unlike most companion dapps, this one automatically connects to the Snap, even though you did not install it or connect it manually from the dapp. See the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/how-to/allow-automatic-connections/\">Snaps documentation</a> for detailed information on how to use this feature.</p>\n<h2>Keep building with MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<br />\nAs we continue to build the permissionless future for web3 wallets, we’re constantly working on improving the experience, and these two new updates are some of what we have in the pipeline. \n<p>If you’re currently building with Snaps, we’d like to know what you think, so <a href=\"https://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/64f99fe2b12d6940df7c0357?utm_source=ownedmedia&#x26;utm_medium=landing-page&#x26;utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_awareness_content\">leave us feedback </a>as it helps us build a better wallet for tomorrow.
