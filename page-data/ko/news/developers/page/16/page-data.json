As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Snapshot Snap With Minci</h3>\n<p>We chat with independent Web3 developer Minci who built the Snapshot Snap at the ETHWarsaw Hackathon—a proof-of-concept application to set up custom notifications for on-chain activities.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/746189468?h=471286f146\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/746189468\">Snapshot: Demo Video</a>  <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user183087024\"></a> <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/iamminci/snapshot\">https://github.com/iamminci/snapshot</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>I find the idea of wallet notifications for on-chain events fascinating. We see it everywhere in web2 with PayPal and Venmo, but the fact that indexing makes it such a challenging feature for web3 is an interesting technical problem to think about. I wanted to try creating a proof of concept application that allows any user to set up their own custom notifications for on-chain activities. I used Metamask Snaps' implementation of notifications in order to build out my prototype.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>The technical implementation involved first setting up a notification snap by triggering an installation through a client-side application. Then, the user configures the snap to listen to the on-chain events of their preference. The vision here was that the user would be able to whitelist any contract address and their associated events such that they would prompt not only a notification but also automated on-chain actions such as sending a transaction or executing a DEX trade based on the trigger. The automated send was made possible by deriving the user’s private key from a BIP44 Address Key Deriver (shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ritave/\">Olaf</a> for his workshop using this library) such that the action would go through without an explicit confirmation from the user. My proof of concept was limited to an example of bidding on Opensea and was actualized using Opensea’s API on Rinkeby testnet.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The demo video was based on a proof of concept that only worked for a handful of pre-configured use cases (bidding on Opensea, automating a send of ether). Next steps to actualize this vision would be configuring some type of storage to be able to dynamically update the events that the snap listens to without having to re-install the notification snap. Also showcasing a dashboard for users to monitor their existing snaps and visualizing the events that were triggered in a single-view would be useful. Also, providing a much more customized range of automated trigger actions beyond just sends but enabling a set of more complex contract calls like setting limit orders or arbitraging.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask Snaps when I visited a Metam]Mask booth at the Miami Permissionless conference. The idea that this could become a plugin ecosystem for MetaMask made me really excited.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>No other wallet has customizable plugins tailored towards developers. I believe this is singular to Metamask in the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, building with MetaMask Snaps wasn’t a walk in the park. I think the lack of proper documentation was the biggest drawback. Thankfully, there were enough interesting examples to be able to derive my own innovation from those building blocks, so I could strongly recommend any developer interested in building with snaps to dive straight into the examples repo.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the obvious future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps could unlock a boundless world of possibilities in web3. Just like Chrome has now become the go-to browser with the extensions ecosystem and VSCode similarly with their own extension marketplace. I could totally see MetaMask Snaps taking MetaMask to the next level by allowing developers to onboard onto the tooling and wildly innovate to customize the wallet to their liking (and in turn, attract users who find those tools useful). An interesting tokenomics would be built around the developers who offer the most compelling MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d urge anyone interested in MetaMask Snaps to dive straight into the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">example repo</a>, fork it, and play around with it!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

It’s not practical–although if you want to perform a manual audit, LavaMoat will help you prioritize the most dangerous ones (more on that later).</p>\n<p>And even if you do have time to really look at the package of differences are you going to be able to catch a security vulnerability?</p>\n<p>Hard thing to bet on. So let’s explore a different solution:</p>\n<p><strong>LavaMoat? Yeah.</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of never using dependencies or auditing all your dependencies always, let’s take a look at LavaMoat’s security kernel that wraps packages in compartments and only gives them access to what they need.</p>\n<p>Because, remember, in order for malicious code to attack your system, it needs permission to do so. <strong>LavaMoat's kernel goes through the third-party code that you’re pulling into your project, determines what the dependencies need to run, and gives those dependencies <em>only that</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat is currently protecting tens of millions of users at MetaMask and runs at three different times during each development process: Installation of dependencies, build, and runtime.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/51M5XNOgDQqykaDpdN9svC/5a255f2bf943d029c01329b940219634/Screen_Shot_2022-10-13_at_11.27.15_AM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 11.27.15 AM\"></p>\n<p>To put things into perspective, check out this dependency graph visualization dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3xeNJrFYj61ibxvjVMOI9Q/41ac5b6653762a5575a27299c4cf56a1/Screen_Shot_2022-10-13_at_11.28.26_AM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"lavamoat npm-viz\"></p>\n<p>The list of your dependencies are on the left and the graph is depicted as a neural network on the right. The colors are based on a heuristic of dangerousness: for example, the green ones don’t import any powerful platform APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>The idea here is to help you prioritize auditing your dependencies.</strong></p>\n<p>So how do you implement this?</p>\n<p>Taking the three development phases into account:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install: @lavamoat/allow-scripts</li>\n<li>Build: lavamoat-node</li>\n<li>Runtime: lavamoat-x plugin for your bundler</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that should act as a moat for malicious code.</p>\n<h3>Building software at scale</h3>\n<p>If you’re interested in helping us, LavaMoat is open-source! We are trying to get plugins for as many bundlers as possible and want to make it easier to review policies and add tight lockdowns when giving network access to packages.

I have been a bitcoiner since 2013 and my team started building hardware wallets in late 2017. We spent over three and a half years improving Bitcoin security and then started to work on Ethereum &amp; Web3 from mid 2021. Keystone became one of the hardware wallet partners of MetaMask. Together, we proudly brought QR-code air-gapped signing to the Ethereum &amp; Web3 community.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask in mid 2020. The MetaMask team was very enthusiastic about security and insightful about the benefits of QR-code air-gapped signing. Not long after we started working on Ethereum &amp; Web3, we started to work with the MetaMask team on a hardware wallet integration. When we first noticed MetaMask Flask (Snaps) in early 2022, we strongly felt that it would be huge in the near future. Since we came from the Bitcoin community, it was pretty natural for us to contribute to Bitcoin Snaps using MetaMask Flask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re very enthusiastic about security. Every wallet provider cares about security but not all of them put enough resources into it. The MetaMask’s founders themselves are also deeply into security and they initiated great projects like MobyMask and LavaMoat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Openness. When we were working on adding QR code air-gapped signing to MetaMask extension as well as the mobile application, the MetaMask team was very responsive during the integration and a great joy to work with. When we were working on the Bitcoin Snaps, the Snaps team also had really quick turn-arounds to add APIs or any other requests.</p>\n<p>Responsibility. As we closely worked with MetaMask, we strongly felt that the MetaMask team took the whole of Web3 development as their own responsibility. This mindset deeply differentiated MetaMask from other software wallets as it helps them see things long-term and make decisions that are best for the community.</p>\n<p>Snaps opens the possibility to let more than 30 million users seamlessly manage their Bitcoin. We are super proud we are part of this great milestone for Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>We strongly feel that if Web3 is going to grow as big as Web2, MetaMask could be the “operating system” of Web3. Thus, MetaMask Snaps is basically the pioneer for that purpose.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dietrich Ayala, IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PSSWeGkp30A-a2UWQFpImdNL1Fbo4oqgC5nhwhTRoQiY41h5Yaer4j1fyuVxrHtlOyVCfCOsOj-8JP8EwrGbfa0aNV3qbeWH1TkVOmxwBC9Ovta2fJs3Xpf6GugChwBGxS_HCwZRJm1NGYL9iKR_tJw\" width=\"161\" height=\"161\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your company?</strong></p>\n<p>My name is Dietrich Ayala, and I'm IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs. A lot of my job is getting IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p working in new and weird places where it currently isn't&nbsp; — from web browsers to IoT to satellites in space. Protocol Labs is where each of those technologies were born, and is now one of many stewards and developers involved in their care and feeding. We are continually working on research and development to radically improve the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Probably late 2017 or 2018... I was working at Mozilla and had a side project called <a href=\"https://github.com/libdweb/libdweb\">libdweb</a>, which added extension APIs to enable browsers to be full participants in p2p networks and blockchains, and I'd run a <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/\">series of articles</a> on Mozilla Hacks. Dipping my toe in the water with these initiatives introduced me to a number of projects in the broader crypto/blockchain space (not yet widely referred to as Web3!), including MetaMask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent over a decade building browsers and evangelizing the web, so MetaMask is special to me in that it's been continually focused on the web as a tier 1 platform and pushed against its limits. The web must change and adapt to meet new user needs, and MetaMask's commitment to it will help make that change happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>We've been lucky to work with both MetaMask and Chainsafe on the FIL Snap. It's been challenging and fun to be part of something new and unproven, and which really lets developers like us do more for our communities through a tool they already use and are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>It's exciting to see a direction towards further extensibility - MetaMask as a platform makes sense, and removes a lot of the constraints that come from being EVM-centric.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>It'll lower the barriers to building dapps with Filecoin, and we're excited to see where that goes. It brings the low-barrier-to-entry for end-user apps on the web to so many new and different blockchain ecosystems that I expect we'll see new applications we could not have foreseen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Flask out and build their own Snap?</strong></p>\n<p>Try to build a basic dapp using one of the Snaps... but that's only half done. Then go share your feedback with MetaMask!</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"개발자","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamasks-community-at-the-core-of-its-growth/","isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2yZ09hD4Jhw3JGqJ4Q3x9J","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"ConsenSys and StarkWare Partner to Bring ZK-Rollups to Infura and MetaMask","slug":"consensys-and-starkware-partner-to-bring-zk-rollups-to-infura-and-metamask","subtitle":"ConsenSys and StarkWare are bringing ZK-rollups to MetaMask and Infura to give developers more network options for a multi-chain future.

With more than 17,000 dapps choosing it as their preferred method for users to connect, MetaMask is the key to connect to Web3. With such a committed developer community and so much desire for innovation, MetaMask created and released a system that allows any developer to build, permissionlessly, on top of the product: MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps provides a way for developers to expand the capabilities of MetaMask and enable new functionality for dapps; for example, connecting to a non-EVM network like StarkNet, and a myriad of other uses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Snaps are currently only available in the development build—MetaMask Flask—which developers will need to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/flask/\">install in their browser</a> to interact with the integration. <em>Please note that MetaMask Flask should be installed in a separate browser profile from MetaMask stable.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Until now, StarkNet hasn’t been directly compatible with MetaMask due to its use of a different address and account format than Ethereum. In other words: <em>not </em><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#evm\"><em>EVM</em></a><em> compatible</em>. This Layer 2 snap is the first of its kind to enable ZK-rollup support, giving users wider access to permissionless decentralized networks for fast, low-cost applications.</p>\n<p>The StarkNet snap derives StarkNet keys from your MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase, allowing you to manage assets on StarkNet. Without having to create another account, you can simply use the StarkNet snap to facilitate:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul><li>Deploying StarkNet accounts</li><li>Making transactions on StarkNet</li><li>Interacting with StarkNet smart contracts</li></ul>\n<p>If you’re a developer and want to get started, make sure you have <a href=\"https://metamask.io/flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a> installed and then install the StarkNet snap <a href=\"https://app.starknet-snap.consensys-solutions.net/\">here</a>.&nbsp; Learn more about installing and using the Starknet snap in our <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-integrates-starkware-into-first-of-its-kind-zk-rollup-snap/\">guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Please note that StarkNet is still in alpha and you may experience service interruptions.
