roadmap to making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Multi-resolver Snap</h3>\n<br /> \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-MF76pOw1Y\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver\">https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build multi-resolver snap?</strong></p>\n<p>The user experience in web3 has long been overlooked. One area in which we see progress is account abstraction. It feels like there is a new naming service almost every week. The goal of these is to simplify the way we interact with each other in this space: names are more recognizable than wallet addresses and therefore build a base layer for identity and reputation systems.</p>\n<p>Additionally, original (naming) standards can benefit the popularity of projects. For example, let us call a project “x”. The new naming standard this project proposes could be called x-domains or x-names. Success in the project would automatically help grow the naming service, while success in the naming service would do the same for the project - a win-win. Now, we are left with a fragmented picture of the namespace. Sure, there are people that try to use every naming service, which results in a race around names in the limited namespace we have in some (domain-based) naming services. Other naming services use more familiar handles, like emails, phone numbers, or more general social handles (Twitter username, IG handle) that people already possess, to eliminate potential markets around these identities.\nMost people end up with one, maybe two handles from different naming services. Because of the variety of choices, developers need to integrate multiple naming service resolvers into their applications.</p>\n<p>When a new naming service takes over a sizable percentage of the market, it should also be integrated into one’s application as to not exclude users of that naming service. From the user’s perspective, searching for alternative applications with similar functionality that also support the naming service of their choice is annoying. Why not let people use whatever they are familiar with AND provide a solution that helps developers focus on creating the best application possible?</p>\n<p>The Multi-resolver Snap does exactly that.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<h4>The gist</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The snap was built for <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/discussions/821#top\">MetaMask Flask 10.20</a>. The current version uses the permissions <code>endowment:network-access</code> and <code>snap_confirm</code>. The first is used in a <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver\">preliminary version</a> to request resolved addresses and translate Twitter IDs to Twitter usernames. The latter shows a confirmation screen to the user highlighting the resulting address before a transaction is created.</p>\n<p>Currently supported resolvers are IDriss and ENS. The Snap runs on localhost.</p>\n<h4>Integration from dApp side</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>For a developer to integrate this Snap, and therefore all available resolvers, one must connect to a wallet and the snap first:</p>\n<pre><code>const connectSnap = async (\n  snapId: string = defaultSnapOrigin,\n  params: Record&#x3C;'version' | string, unknown> = {},\n) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_enable',\n    params: [\n      {\n        wallet_snap: {\n          [snapId]: {\n            ...params,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Invoking happens through the method <code>resolve_send</code> and can be called through:</p>\n<pre><code>const resolveInput = async (id_?: string) => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'resolve_send',\n        identifier: id_,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>which returns the resolved address. Here, <code>id_</code> is the identifier that the user inputs into a sending field.</p>\n<p>Using the new <code>multiChainProvider</code>, connecting to the snap is as simple as connecting to the wallet with the required permissions:</p>\n<pre><code>import { MultiChainProvider } from \"@metamask/multichain-provider\";\n\nconst provider = new MultiChainProvider();\nconst { approval } = await provider.connect({\n  requiredNamespaces: {\n    eip155: {\n      chains: [chains],\n      methods: [\n        permissions\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n});\nconst session = await approval();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above-mentioned <code>resolve_send</code> method can be renamed to <code>eth_sendTransaction</code>, allowing apps to use the Multi-resolver Snap without needing to change any integrations. Whenever <code>eth_sendTransaction</code> is called, the Snap is interposed and resolves the input before creating the transaction. Applications should allow for inputs of type <code>String</code> instead of throwing an error whenever an user input does not match an address. The snap then takes care of the rest!</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>As a next step, this snap will be taken open-source to encourage other developers to hunt for bugs, improve the code, and even add their custom resolvers. Open-sourcing will unlock the true potential of this Snap: not a single developer or entity has to integrate all emerging naming services. A <code>contribute.md</code> file promotes this process. Additionally, further development from the MetaMask Snaps team will be tracked.</p>\n<p>Precisely, two specific things greatly benefit this snap:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>endowment:transaction-insight</code> permission for account-to-account transfers to remove the additional <code>snap_confirm</code> call before a transaction is triggered, and</li>\n<li>UI injections into MetaMask. The goal is to implement the snap into the sending field so users can utilize the multi-resolver without connecting to a website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, a complete integration with the <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/ts-library\">IDriss resolver</a> is sought. Full integration allows users to send crypto and NFTs to any email, phone number, and Twitter username without needing to be registered in the IDriss book.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/53ZvMx1js90Dskut5ygAm/dd6ca6050e755c22388b24edd1ea0eec/Screenshot_2023-05-24_at_9.37.23_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-24 at 9.37.23 AM\"></p>\n<p>My name is Lennard, and I have been interested in the blockchain space since 2017. For over a year, I have been building and co-founding <a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/\">IDriss</a>, a decentralized mapping of emails, phone numbers, and Twitter usernames to wallet addresses. More generally, I focus on building tools toward a more usable web3, which motivated me to build this snap.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>The Snaps team is very present at conferences this year (2022) , so I have been running into them a couple of times now. The first time I interacted with the code base was after one of their presentations at EthCC 2022 in Paris. While the features were still limited, the documentation was already promising, and I am very hopeful for the future of MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I have not seen a similar approach to including outside contributors in the development of wallets yet. While some other wallets have open-sourced their code, Snaps enable developers to expand the functionality of MetaMask directly. I am sure this approach will be adopted by other projects as well, as it can be better maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a great opportunity to build this snap during a hackathon. Having the MetaMask Snaps team around helped whenever questions came up. One thing that is still missing is the ability to customize MetaMask’s UI. Additionally, some dependency issues are hard to debug, which takes over most of the development time.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Snaps provide a playground for developers to integrate their projects or ideas directly into MetaMask in a permissionless way. For me, this means that the growth of any project can be accelerated, as users can suddenly enjoy more benefits using the tools (wallets) they already own.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Snaps can help prevent scams through transaction insights, create a more network-inclusive experience with keyrings, and allow for a more user-friendly web3 experience using custom resolvers paired with UI enhancements. Together, this will bring more people into the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Go to hackathons!

While the frontend is a simple web application that hosts the UI, it also acts as a companion DApp for our Snaps application.</p>\n<p>Most of the functionality is achieved in the snap, but the remaining is in the frontend to facilitate the users to request amount from others and/or configure their tags through our UI. While the <em>request amount</em> feature uses the XMTP protocol, the tagging feature uses the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snaps-json-rpc-api\">MetaMask Snaps API</a>.</p>\n<p>We have used the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">snap monorepo</a> as the template to begin with. The full implementation of our project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/shree675/FoxTagger\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>The Snaps Application</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>In our entire implementation, we make use of the following main features provided by the Snaps API:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Persistence storage</li>\n<li>Notifications</li>\n<li>Cron jobs</li>\n<li>Transaction insights</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our implementation begins by first exposing some functions to the frontend in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\index.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'getPersistentStorage':\n      return await getPersistentStorage();\n    case 'setPersistentStorage':\n      await setPersistentStorage(\n        request.params as void | Record&#x3C;string, unknown>,\n      );\n      return null;\n    case 'clearPersistentStorage':\n      await clearPersistentStorage();\n      return null;\n\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Method not found.');\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The functions <code>getPersistenceStorage</code> and <code>setPersistenceStorage</code> are very fundamental as they facilitate the storage and retrieval of tags and other information and are defined as shown in the below code snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  return await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['get'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const clearPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['clear'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const setPersistentStorage = async (\n  data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void,\n) => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['update', data],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>For all the feature implementations, we have created a suitable datastructure for our persistence storage.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"from_account0\": {\n      mainMapping: {\n        \"to_account0\": [\"tag0\",\"tag1\"],\n        ...\n      },\n      usage: {\n        \"tag0\": {\n          limit: \"100000000000\",\n          used: \"800000\",\n          notified: false\n        },\n        ...\n      },\n      latestHash: \"transaction_hash0\"\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>A user can have multiple accounts and each account has its own tags, usage and user-defined limits.</p>\n<h4>Transaction Insights</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The transaction insights feature displays the associated tags, their corresponding expenditures and alerts, if any, in an ongoing transaction.</p>\n<p>In the same <code>index.ts</code> file, we add a transaction insights handler that allows us to intercept an ongoing transaction and interact with the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n  const insights = await getDetails(transaction);\n\n  return {\n    insights,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function <code>getDetails</code> implements the entire logic for calculating the expenditure and showing alerts. This is implemented in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\transaction.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getDetails = async (transaction: Record&#x3C;string, unknown>) => {\n  const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n  const account = (transaction.from as string).toLowerCase();\n  const completeStorage = (await getPersistentStorage()) as any;\n\n  if (!completeStorage?.[account]) {\n    throw new Error('Storage initialization failed.');\n  }\n\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.mainMapping || !storage.usage) {\n    throw new Error('Data corrput. Please re-install the snap.');\n  }\n\n  const tagList = storage.mainMapping[toAddress];\n  if (!tagList?.length) {\n    return {\n      Tag: NO_TAG_MESSAGE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  let tags = '';\n  let alerts = '';\n  let usageMsg = '';\n\n  for (const tag of tagList) {\n    if (tags === '') {\n      tags += `${tag}`;\n    } else {\n      tags += `, ${tag}`;\n    }\n    let { used } = storage.usage[tag];\n    let { limit } = storage.usage[tag];\n    const fixedUsed = FixedNumber.from(used);\n    const fixedLimit = FixedNumber.from(limit);\n    const usedPercent = (\n      Number(fixedUsed.divUnsafe(fixedLimit).toString()) * 100\n    ).toFixed(2);\n    used = BigNumber.from(used);\n    limit = BigNumber.from(limit);\n\n    const amount = BigNumber.from(transaction.value as string);\n    const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gas as string);\n    const total = amount.add(gas);\n\n    if (usageMsg === '') {\n      usageMsg += `${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    } else {\n      usageMsg += ` | ${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    }\n\n    if (!limit.eq('0')) {\n      if (used.gt(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${EXCEEDED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      } else if (used.add(total).gte(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${WILL_EXCEED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (alerts === '') {\n    return {\n      Tag: tags,\n      Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {\n    Tag: tags,\n    Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    Alerts: alerts,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this, we are first checking if the current transaction’s <em>to</em> hash (or <em>to</em> address) is present in the storage. Then we retrieve and calculate the usage percentage. We then check if the usage is about to reach, or has already reached the set limit for that tag and we send an appropriate alert.</p>\n<p>Notice that we use <strong>BigNumber</strong> and <strong>FixedNumber</strong> classes available in the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers\">ethers</a> npm package to handle arithmetic operations on large numbers.</p>\n<p>Transaction insights is now complete and this is the final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/h4Vxe5SiAOs0y7vviJkND/6c637c9e70b041140ca49d14450f478e/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.22.44_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.22.44 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Cron Jobs</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Defined here are three cron jobs, <code>weeklySummary</code> for generating the summary every week, <code>checkLimits</code> to check if the user has exceeded limits on any of his/her tags and <code>updateAmount</code> that updates the usage information of new transactions performed by the user.</p>\n<p>These cron jobs are mentioned in <code>packages\\snap\\snap.manifest.json</code>, with their appropriate frequency. Additionally, a cron job handler is incorporated in <code>index.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>These functionalities are defined in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\cron.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getSummary = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n  let exceeded = false;\n  let hasTag = false;\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      hasTag = true;\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n\n      if (\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt('0')\n      ) {\n        exceeded = true;\n      }\n\n      // reset usage information for the next week\n      newUsage[tag].notified = false;\n      newUsage[tag].used = '0';\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (hasTag) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n  }\n\n  return exceeded;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we iterate through the storage and check if the user has crossed any limits on any of the tags. We then reset <code>notified</code> to <code>false</code> so that it can be reused by <code>checkLimits</code> cron job. We return a boolean value for the cron job handler to pick it up for each user account and send an appropriate notification message at the end of the week.</p>\n<pre><code>export const checkLimits = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const tags: string[] = [];\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n      const { notified } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n      if (\n        !notified &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt(BigNumber.from('0'))\n      ) {\n        tags.push(tag);\n        newUsage[tag].notified = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (tags.length > 0) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n\n    const message = `${LIMIT_ALERT_HEADER + tags.length} tags on ${compact(\n      account,\n    )}`;\n    return message;\n  }\n\n  return null;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above function, we once again iterate through all non-notified user tags and check their usage. If it has exceeded the set limit, we set <code>notified</code> to <code>true</code> so that this tag is not picked up again until the next week. We return a message to the cron job handler stating the number of tags that crossed the limit and the user’s account hash.</p>\n<p>Next, we complete the implementation for <code>updateAmount</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const updateAmount = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://api-goerli.etherscan.io/api?module=account&#x26;action=txlist&#x26;address=${account}&#x26;startblock=0&#x26;endblock=9999999999&#x26;sort=asc&#x26;apikey=${process.env.REACT_API_KEY}`,\n  );\n  const result = await response.json();\n\n  if (!result.result) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  let transactions = result.result;\n  if (transactions.length === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // sort in descending order\n  transactions = transactions.sort(\n    (a: any, b: any) => b.timeStamp - a.timeStamp,\n  );\n\n  const { latestHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  const { prevHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  if (transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  for (const transaction of transactions) {\n    if (transaction.hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n      break;\n    }\n\n    if (transaction.to !== account) {\n      const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n      const tagList = completeStorage[account].mainMapping[toAddress];\n\n      if (tagList !== null &#x26;&#x26; tagList !== undefined) {\n        for (const tag of tagList) {\n          const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gasPrice).mul(\n            BigNumber.from(transaction.gasUsed),\n          );\n          const value = BigNumber.from(transaction.value);\n          const total = gas.add(value);\n          if (prevHash !== latestHash) {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from(\n              completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used,\n            )\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          } else {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from('0')\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  completeStorage[account].prevHash = latestHash;\n  completeStorage[account].latestHash = transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase();\n\n  return completeStorage;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we use the <a href=\"https://docs.etherscan.io/v/goerli-etherscan/\">etherscan API</a> to fetch all the user transactions and update the usage details for each tag. We sort the obtained transactions in decreasing order of time and scan them from <code>latestHash</code> transaction to avoid rescanning of transactions. We finally update <code>latestHash</code>. This cron job runs more frequently than <code>checkLimits</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are a few outputs of the above implementations:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/75yjXTyGHM43SE7mfP81Km/7a2ca077862463f656efadff0ad44a9f/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.26.54_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.26.54 PM\"></p>\n<h4>The Frontend DApp</h4>\n<br /> \n<h5>Tagging Feature</h5>\n<br /> \n<p>The website has two pages. The first page is the landing page where the user can login, add/remove tags, check his/her tag usage distribution, set limits and apply filters on the tags and transactions. All of this is achieved through the familiar React.js functionality. The transactions are fetched from the previously mentioned etherscan API and the addresses are associated with their corresponding tags. This information comes from the persistence storage of the connected Snaps.</p>\n<p>The logic for most of the above features is written in <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\GetTableData.jsx</code>. The integration of the snap with the frontend is sophisticated, yet intuitive once finished.</p>\n<p>The snap methods are exposed to the frontend by writing the following functions in <code>packages\\site\\src\\utils\\snap.ts</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Get the persisted data from the snap.\n *\n * @returns The persisted data, if any, 'null' otherwise.\n */\nexport const getStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'getPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Update the persistent storage in the snap.\n *\n * @param data - The complete data to be stored.\n */\nexport const setStorage = async (data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'setPersistentStorage',\n        params: data,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Clear the persistent storage in the snap.\n */\nexport const clearStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'clearPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2\">react-chartjs-2</a> npm package to display analytics of the user’s expenditure.</p>\n<p>This is the final look of the website:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/AWO9lNPmaXnJXUEtNMXqN/c9b685ec2b2644c1ff6edbe5c3b7f85d/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.28.50_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.28.50 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Request Amount Feature</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This is a unique feature in which a user can send a notification through XMTP to another user requesting for ETH. For this, both the users need to have this snap enabled. This feature is made available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/request\">http://localhost:8000/request</a>.</p>\n<p>For this, we use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xmtp/xmtp-js\">@xmtp/xmtp-js</a> npm package to create <code>WalletContext</code> and <code>XmtpContext</code> in <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\WalletContext.tsx</code> and <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\XmtpContext.tsx</code> respectively. We also create hooks and components. Most of this code directly comes from an example in the <a href=\"https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-quickstart-react\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We create a new page, <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\request.tsx</code> in the website to accommodate the UI for this feature. We send messages using the sendMessage function from the <code>useSendMessage</code> hook.</p>\n<pre><code>import useSendMessage from '../hooks/useSendMessage';\n\nconst sendNewMessage = () => {\n    const payload = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      message: msgTxt,\n    };\n    sendMessage(JSON.stringify(payload));\n    setMsgTxt('');\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we display the received messages using the provider state of <code>XmtpContext</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import { XmtpContext } from '../contexts/XmtpContext';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n    const [providerState] = useContext(XmtpContext);\n    const { convoMessages, client } = providerState;\n\n    return (\n        &#x3C;>\n            &#x3C;ConversationList\n                convoMessages={convoMessages}\n                setSelectedConvo={setSelectedConvo}\n            />\n        &#x3C;/>\n    )\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>After following the example in the above mentioned documentation, we finally attain the required functionality:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/56ckGzBW5BnSehYheh5Eqt/8f3fa3518be25d1fefdd334ef7f1a6f9/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.31.53_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.31.53 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This completes FoxTagger, the entire project with our idea manifested into a MetaMask Snaps application, coupled with a DApp.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The next step would be to extend the tagging functionality by adding more analytics and using a Machine Learning model to make predictions and suggestions on how to minimize the user’s expenditure.\nThen we can aim to incorporate a transaction split feature where the user can split a fee among multiple accounts, adding on top of the request amount feature.</p>\n<p>Additionally, MetaMask Snap’s new custom UI functionality could be leveraged to provide a more pleasing user experience inside the snap.\nFinally, the snap can be extended to chains other than the Goerli Testnet network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6om9b00PGfNjh6CMwVGtui/708e691cdf4d127c9fcad36a5d347676/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.17.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.17.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>From ideation to implementation, our team collaborated to generate ideas, refine them, and overcome challenges to come up with our FoxTagger Snaps.</p>\n<p>Sachin Sahu played a pivotal role in developing the frontend and functionalities of the dApp. Not only did he help integrate MetaMask Snaps with the platform, but he also worked on the demo and documentation to ensure that users have all the information they need to start using the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Siddhartha G's expertise in frontend design and implementation was crucial to the development of the platform.

That's where MetaMask Snaps come in - the developer community now has more freedom to customize and personalize MetaMask based on user requirements, making it easier than ever to interact with different dApps that may be built on different blockchains or use different protocols.</p>\n<p>The benefits of MetaMask Snaps are numerous, including the ability to track expenditures over time, analyze spending, donate a small percent of each transaction to charity, request payment from clients, set up autopay for Netflix subscriptions, and much more! Integrating MetaMask with various DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and social media platforms is now a breeze with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p>But Snaps aren't just for complex financial transactions. Imagine going out to lunch with friends and paying with cryptocurrency - with MetaMask Snaps, splitting the bill and requesting payment from your friends is as simple as a single tap! That’s the power of MetaMask Snaps!</p>\n<p>As the Web3 space continues to evolve, MetaMask Snaps is sure to become an increasingly important tool for developers and users alike. With the potential of the metaverse on the horizon, the use cases of Snaps are truly endless.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>We would advise them to first go through the existing snaps on github. This will help them a lot in understanding the potential of the features provided by MetaMask Snaps, although the features look simple on paper.</p>\n<p>We would also suggest they use the existing monorepo template to start with their implementation. It has many benefits. The repo is structured very well along with linting checks and actions, developers can implement both a companion web app and a snap in one package. Moreover, the repo is always on par with the official documentation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we recommend them to post their issues or doubts on community channels and help increase their exposure to MetaMask’s Snaps.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

MetaMask Grants DAO not only accelerates growth for crypto-comfortable users but also aims to promote long-term adoption among crypto-curious individuals by providing multiple pathways for participation.</p>\n<p>Every ConsenSys employee can opt-in to be a Grants DAO member with equal voting rights governed by a non-transferable token. Learn more about the DAO <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How do I apply?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>You can apply for a MetaMask grant here: <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\">https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\n</a></p>\n<p>Recipients include projects that have previously collaborated with MetaMask as well as new relationships formed as a result of the DAO.</p>\n<p>We’ll use information from a prior grant recipient, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/metamask-grants-dao-funds-agoric-and-safeheron-with-first-round-of-grants/\">Safeheron</a> as an example in this guide.</p>\n<p>To increase your chances of being funded, make sure to keep these 3 tips in mind when filling out your application:</p>\n<h4>#1 Be specific about your project and the problem you solve</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Make sure you’re able to describe your project clearly. What are your goals, why is it important, and how does it align with our mission? Does it fit into our <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/request-for-proposals\">current wish list</a>?</p>\n<p>In Safeheron’s application, they clearly stated how their project revolved around improving MetaMask’s key management experience, specifically with a focus on helping users manage their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) to reduce phishing attacks while also reducing the chance of those keys being lost.</p>\n<p>This is an extremely important issue to the MetaMask team as we prioritize user security above all else.</p>\n<p>When filling out your grant application, don’t hesitate to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data</strong>: Do you have quantitative data to illustrate the problem you’re solving?</li>\n<li><strong>Track record</strong>: What have you and your team been involved with? Have you participated in one of our hackathons? Collaborated with our team in the past? Let us know! Safeheron mentioned their previous relationship with the MetaMask and Keystone team in implementing a 2/2 MPC snap and described how a grant would fund the evolution of this into a 2/3 MPC snap.</li>\n<li><strong>Roadmap</strong>: What is your vision and what part of your roadmap and execution will our grant enable? Feel free to call out future steps, but be clear in delineating what portion of your project the grant will be funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#2 Include key milestones and a path to production</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Including milestones, timelines, and a thorough strategy helps us evaluate the feasibility of your project. And maybe we can even fund a portion of your build, so be explicit in your milestones. Be realistic when sketching this out— what targets would you measure your productivity by? What does success look like? Does it make sense to break out your path to production by dev weeks or by milestones achieved?</p>\n<p>Milestones, for example, could look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2/2 MPC solution implemented with MetaMask Flask and Keystone hardware wallet</li>\n<li>Compatible 2/3 MPC algorithm developed</li>\n<li>Designs for the 2/3 MPC experience</li>\n<li>Integration of 2/3 MPC algorithm with Flask, Keystone, and MetaMask Mobile</li>\n<li>Security review</li>\n<li>Marketing and PR preparation</li>\n<li>Launch</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#3 Clearly describe how the budget would be used</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>What would the funding go towards? What are some blocks you’re currently experiencing? Include cost breakdowns so there’s an understanding of where the grant could contribute best.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re requesting funding for $35,000 how much of that will be used for development costs, security audits, marketing, etc.? We commonly see that audit fees can be a point of pressure for teams, so feel free to get an application in, even if it’s just to cover audit costs.</p>\n<h3>Making an impact</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask Grants DAO was funded to enable and empower the developer ecosystem to keep building, innovating, and thriving. If you believe your project is making a positive impact and would benefit from a grant, we encourage you to <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\">apply for funding!</a></p>\n<p>Keep tabs on our <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> page, and stay up to date on our developer offerings on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMaskDev\">Twitter</a>.

But, still, the question remains: “How do we go about bringing the next billion users to web3?”</p>\n<p>Depending on who you ask, answers to the question will vary. But everyone agrees on some points—particularly the need to improve the experience of users interacting with blockchain applications. Without making web3 more user-friendly, people have little incentive to switch from the web2 apps they use every day.</p>\n<p>“Account abstraction” is a proposal seeking to improve user interactions with Ethereum—one that’s increasingly the subject of many discussions in the crypto community. You may, however, be thinking: “What exactly is account abstraction and why should I care about it?”</p>\n<p>This article is designed to help you make sense of account abstraction by putting its past, present, and future into context. We’ll be answering every question you may have about the topic—specifically, the who, what, why, how, and when of account abstraction.</p>\n<p>A quick summary of key talking points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Programmable, self-custodial accounts (“smart accounts”) can reduce the friction of onboarding new users to the web3 ecosystem. However, limitations imposed by Ethereum’s design prevent broad adoption and use of smart accounts.</li>\n<li>Account abstraction introduces significant changes that pave the way for wide adoption of trustless, censorship-resistant smart accounts. Different approaches to implementing account abstraction are being considered—each featuring unique benefits and tradeoffs.</li>\n<li>MetaMask is supporting adoption of account abstraction through its permissionless innovation platform: <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>. With MetaMask Snaps, developers can extend MetaMask to bring the benefits of account abstraction to crypto users around the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is account abstraction?</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Like any other new concept in web3, account abstraction can be hard to define. Nevertheless, we can better understand it by first unpacking the various terms relevant to the discussion of account abstraction in Ethereum:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Abstraction</strong> <em>(n)</em>: A (fairly complicated) term in computer science that roughly means hiding information about a system or application so it can be used with less knowledge of the processes running in the background. Also defined as <em>“the process of hiding the complexity of a system by providing an interface that eases its manipulation.”</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Account</strong> <em>(n)</em>: A user's representation on the blockchain that can send or receive transactions and interact with other on-chain accounts. Ethereum has two types of accounts: <strong>Externally Owned Accounts</strong> (EOAs) and <strong>contract accounts</strong> (aka “smart contracts”).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2a. <strong>Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)</strong>: Ethereum accounts generated using wallet software (like MetaMask) and managed by a cryptographic pair of public and private keys. An EOA is “active” (it can initiate transactions and pay gas fees for EVM execution). However, it is limited to executing basic operations—like sending Ether or interacting with contracts.</p>\n<p>2b. <strong>Contract accounts</strong>: Ethereum accounts deployed as a <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/\">smart contract</a> and controlled by logic written in code (instead of a private key). A contract account is “passive”: it can only send <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/\">transactions</a> in response to a transaction from an EOA and cannot pay gas fees. It is, however, <em>programmable</em> and can execute arbitrary logic depending on code stored at the address.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1647oIfQlB2tVf0kvtOEzn/459f3aa5f4d67de4dac8fd150bd10bae/new_EOAs_vs_contract_accounts_2x.png\" alt=\"new EOAs vs contract accounts@2x\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Wallet</strong> <em>(n)</em>:  An interface for managing the funds in your Ethereum account—how a wallet operates depends on what type of account it is linked with. An <em>EOA-based wallet</em> like MetaMask requires a private key to authorize transactions. Meanwhile, a <em>smart contract wallet</em> is linked to a contract account and can use arbitrary logic to authorize a transactions (eg. using a <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-multisig-wallet/\">multisignature scheme</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these definitions out of the way, we can now define account abstraction.</p>\n<p><strong>Defining account abstraction</strong></p>\n<p>Account abstraction is a proposal to increase flexibility in the <em>management</em> and <em>behavior</em> of Ethereum accounts. We achieve this by introducing <strong><em>account contracts</em></strong>: special-purpose smart contracts that define and manage a user’s Ethereum account (now called a <em>smart account</em>).</p>\n<p>With account abstraction, you can enjoy programmable access to funds by using a smart contract wallet instead of relying solely on private keys for security. This is possible because your smart account can have custom rules for spending coins and transferring assets.</p>\n<p>So, how does “abstraction” fit into all of this?</p>\n<p>From a network-level perspective, “account abstraction” means the details of account types are <em>invisible</em> to the Ethereum protocol. Every account (including self-custodial accounts) is simply a smart contract, and users are free to determine how individual accounts are managed and operated.</p>\n<p>From a user-level perspective, “account abstraction” means certain technical details about interacting with Ethereum accounts are concealed behind higher-level interfaces. This improves wallet designs and significantly reduces the complexity of using web3 applications.</p>\n<p>This clarification is necessary because confusion around account abstraction comes from not knowing (a) <em>what</em> is being abstracted and (b) <em>where</em> the abstraction occurs. Accounts aren’t necessarily abstracted from users (even if they are abstracted from the protocol). You still have a wallet address to receive funds and a signing key to ensure only you can spend those funds.</p>\n<p>From your perspective, account abstraction is more like using a smart account that abstracts some details about interacting with the blockchain. For context, this is what interacting with a dapp looks like from the perspective of a first-time user:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5GwjBrBDSxaBqoPLzgY9Ah/436d6837761be954dc756628819a338f/Workflow_of_creating_an_EOAand_interacting_with_dapp_2x.png\" alt=\"Workflow of creating an EOA and interacting with dapp@2x\"></p>\n<p>With account abstraction, wallet developers can create systems that handle these processes in the background and simplify the experience of using web3 (TL;DR: <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/sylve.eth/A8VnNvBVbc0aXmW2FlG58ysI8oZUnH0HGwwjIsQGHUk\">wallets become “invisible”</a>). Some use cases (which we’ll expand on later) include: eliminating the need for you to store seed phrases/private keys, pay gas for transactions, or even set up an on-chain account by yourself.</p>\n<h3>The benefits of account abstraction</h3>\n<br />\n<p>As mentioned previously, account abstraction removes most of the friction associated with using web3 wallets and interacting with dapps. This brings web3 closer to the ideal of web2 where all users—both novice and experienced—can benefit from the same degree of flexibility, security, and ease of use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7qUFagETU8YLBUke3Rphls/6cb508eb04098321458d0b44a55a19e4/Screenshot_2023-04-25_at_1.00.34_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 1.00.34 PM\"></p>\n<p>In particular, account abstraction has <em>huge</em> implications for the future of self-custody. With the features provided by account contracts, using a web3 wallet will feel like using a bank account or application without having to trust the bank.</p>\n<p>In subsequent sections, we’ll touch on the different dimensions of account abstraction and discuss how they improve the experience of using Ethereum. Specifically, we’ll talk about <em>signature abstraction, fee abstraction</em>, and <em>nonce abstraction</em>.</p>\n<h4>Signature abstraction</h4>\n<br />\n<p>Today, transactions from your EOA must have a signature generated by the account’s private key using the <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#ecdsa\">Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm</a> (ECDSA) to be valid. This gives most EOAs a simple security model: funds are safe if private keys remain in the user’s possession. But it also has several limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>EOAs are notoriously difficult to secure, particularly as malicious actors are always evolving new ways of compromising private keys.</strong> At MetaMask, we’ve seen firsthand the challenges that phishing, social engineering, spoofing, malware injection, and similar attacks pose to user security in web3.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self-custody may feel like an extreme sport.</strong> Unlike your regular bank account, you cannot “recover” an EOA wallet if the seed phrase/private key is lost. This creates a challenge for new users who must grapple with the implications of completely losing assets held in Ethereum accounts without any recourse.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3LB2FZPuruKr1qh0Lwm3Of/d9b890df197a7735eb040476fe4a4826/Security-related_drawbacks_of_EOAs_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Security-related drawbacks of EOAs@2x\"></p>\n<p><em>Signature abstraction</em> solves these problems by removing ECDSA signatures as the default authorization mechanism for non-custodial accounts. Rather, users are permitted to define custom rules for authorizing wallets to initiate transactions. Or, said another way, <em>you</em> can decide what it means for a transaction to be valid.</p>\n<p>Implementing signature abstraction opens up possibilities for more advanced authorization schemes. This way, using your web3 wallet will feel similar, if not better than, a web2 banking application. Here are some use cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transaction limits:</strong> A wallet linked to your smart account can reject a transaction (or ask for additional authorization) if the value exceeds a preset limit. Sounds familiar? It should—banks do it already to protect your accounts and credit cards against fraud, unauthorized usage, and other reasons related to security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-party approvals:</strong> You could delegate partial control of your account to trusted parties aka “guardians”. Guardians can be friends, family members, service providers, or even a separate device that you own (eg. a hardware wallet). Thus you can enable web2-style  multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your wallet by requiring guardian approval for transactions that withdraw funds from your smart account.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1C328YvdxnJqZQu6louNxA/1423ed9a1dc6d9b037a3a3754d3b770c/Multi-factor_authentication_for_web3_wallets_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-factor authentication for web3 wallets@2x\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key rotation and revocation:</strong> With smart accounts, you can generate a new signing key if the previous key was lost or stolen. For additional security, you can have guardians freeze your account during the recovery process and demand approval for key rotation/revocation flows (ie. <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html\">social recovery</a>). This is similar to how you can freeze your credit card if it’s misplaced/stolen without losing access to your bank account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Trusted sessions:</strong> Do you dislike having to approve every action when interacting with a dapp in your browser? Great! You can create special <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/matchboxdao.eth/VXOvLKIvfXHP-cusKHw55zqlHpvvWwzh_fqm6j48Yek\">“session keys”</a> with your smart account for dapps to automatically sign transactions for a specific period. This means you can interact with dapps—playing a blockchain game, say—without getting pestered with wallet pop-ups.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1PRJPrmFxXj6qq5Nc1OTxK/740e57d3dc380c611de0557757896df2/Using_a_dapp_with_session_keys_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Using a dapp with session keys@2x\"></p>\n<p>At a high level, session keys are based on a smart contract that controls interactions between your account and a dapp. You <em>always</em> have control of session keys and can regulate the dapp’s signing authority, such as how much it can deduct from your balance or what functions it can call.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7zePDQiZkvUiXCtmb7ugm3/90bde4a9e861f361b7ecba3348648f13/How_a_user____approves____a_trusted_session_2x.jpg\" alt=\"How a user “approves” a trusted session@2x\"></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Automatic payments:</strong> Similar to the idea of session keys, you can approve service providers to “pull” funds from your smart account (subject to predefined rules). This makes it possible to <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/auto-payments-for-self-custodial-wallets.html\">set up recurring payments and subscriptions</a> with your web3 wallet. Can you imagine paying for a Netflix subscription or utility bill using your Ethereum account?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Fee abstraction</h4>\n<br />\n<p>Currently, every Ethereum transaction must have a “gas fee” denoting how much the sending EOA is willing to pay for execution. Gas fees are denominated in Ether, Ethereum’s native token. This creates problems, especially for new users who now need to source for ETH before sending their transaction.</p>\n<p>Account abstraction doesn’t eliminate the need to pay gas fees, but it abstracts away details of how and when users choose to pay for gas (<strong>fee abstraction</strong>). For example, account abstraction enables “sponsored transactions” where another account covers the cost of gas for a user’s transaction. Some benefits of sponsored transactions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Non-ETH gas payments:</strong> Have you ever wished you could pay for transaction fees with ERC-20 tokens in your wallet? With sponsored transactions, you can get a <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-transaction-relayer-and-how-does-it-work-bd1q3ywa\">relayer</a> with ETH to front the cost for your transactions and pay them back in another token like DAI or USDC.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5YjYkflfhpoftlmlOLOWnx/6de15e5d4da285765903f3dbede68260/Normal_transactions_vs_ETH-less_transactions_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Normal transactions vs ETH-less transactions@2x\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Gasless transactions:</strong> Dapp developers can sponsor transactions and minimize onboarding friction for new Ethereum users.

The great part? Wallets can use authentication infrastructure (eg. <a href=\"https://web3auth.io/\">Web3Auth</a> and <a href=\"https://webauthn.guide/\">WebAuthn</a>) to enable users to create web3 accounts with existing credentials like an <a href=\"https://archive.nervos.org/blog/joyid-a-passwordless-web3-wallet-that-will-accelerate-the-mass-adoption-for-nervos\">email address</a> or Facebook/Twitter account.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Nonce abstraction</h4>\n<br />\n<p>Smart accounts on Ethereum have another special feature: transaction batching. With batched transactions, you can combine multiple operations into a single on-chain transaction and reduce the cost and complexity of interacting with dapps. Here’s why transaction batching is important:</p>\n<p>Your EOA stores a value known as a “<a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/7417499333531-How-to-customize-a-transaction-nonce\">nonce</a>” that shows how many transactions you’ve sent (think of it like a transaction counter). A new transaction must strictly increase the nonce by 1 to be valid—a rule that prevents someone else from “replaying” the same transaction to steal your funds (yup, <a href=\"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-is-replay-attack-on-ethereum-nfts/\">it can happen</a>).</p>\n<p>But there’s a catch. Nonces force you to process transactions in first-in-first-out (FIFO) style. Imagine you have two transactions (A and B) with nonce of 0 and 1, respectively. Here, you’d send transaction A and wait for a confirmation (of its execution) before sending B.</p>\n<p>Sending B while A is still pending would simply have the former rejected since the nonce would be higher than the prescribed range (EOA’s current nonce + 1). In fact, this is a big reason you have “<a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251\">stuck transactions</a>\" when using a wallet.</p>\n<p>Nonce abstraction allows you to create custom replay protection mechanisms (instead of the Ethereum protocol enforcing strict ordering on transactions). For example, you can have a nonce scheme that permits processing multiple transactions in parallel. This would solve the problem of clogged/stuck transactions and significantly improve interactions with dapps.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1m3tAeocanxSBS5ulnj9QT/7fd20c73b11cf64422fd55f649ccb3ed/Nonce_abstraction_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Nonce abstraction@2x\"></p>\n<p>That said, nonce abstraction is difficult to implement in practice and can potentially break certain invariants critical to security and UX, such as transaction hash uniqueness). This is where transaction batching comes into the picture:</p>\n<p>Since smart accounts can process multiple transactions at once, the need for complex nonce abstraction schemes largely disappears. Going back to the previous example, we can imagine transaction A and B are merely parts of a single hypothetical operation like swapping assets on Uniswap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transaction A</strong>: Approve the Uniswap contract to access your tokens</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction B</strong>: Complete the token swap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With transaction batching, you can combine the approve-and-swap workflow into one transaction. The result: lower gas fees and reduced wait-times when using dapps. Cool, eh?</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6F4neIpP9dxlY1jPGGpdFD/b2d33ded2dad9610b4b6b1859eccac36/How_transaction_batching_improves_the_workflow_of_using_a_DeFi_dapp_2x.jpg\" alt=\"How transaction batching improves the workflow of using a DeFi dapp@2x\"></p>\n<h3>The “how” of account abstraction</h3>\n<br />\n<p>At this point, you already know account abstraction allows us to add custom functionality and authorization policies to user accounts. But we really haven’t talked about how any of that is possible. This section discusses different approaches to implementing abstraction on Ethereum (if that doesn’t sound too appealing, feel free to skip to the next section).</p>\n<p>There are two generally accepted ways of achieving account abstraction: (a) letting EOAs execute EVM code and (b) allowing smart contracts to initiate transactions. Hence, you’ll find that many account abstraction proposals either want EOAs to behave as smart contracts or contract accounts to act as EOAs.</p>\n<p>This naturally brings up some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“How exactly are these approaches different?”</li>\n<li>“Why does it matter which approach we adopt?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Account abstraction: Approach #1 (Upgrading EOAs to execute code)</h4>\n<br />\n<p>By giving EOAs the ability to execute code, we can add complex functionality to user-controlled accounts. This supercharges EOAs and transforms them into smart accounts, setting the stage for native account abstraction. Importantly, this approach allows you to enjoy the benefits of a programmable wallet <em>without</em> incurring the cost of deploying a new contract account.</p>\n<p>Some approaches to upgrading EOAs to contract accounts involve treating the data payload of EOA transactions as EVM bytecode. Others involve delegating control of an EOA to a special account contract that makes transactions on the EOA’s behalf. In the latter case, the same account contract can be reused by different EOAs, reducing the need to have different contract wallet implementations.</p>\n<p>Below is an infographic showing different account abstraction proposals in the “make EOAs programmable” camp, including their key features and status of implementation:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/26hqNr3Dd7uLfnNMd94Pmk/95152174f52a9d99f988aa1b3fdb285d/Account_abstraction_proposals__I__2x.jpg\" alt=\"Account abstraction proposals (I)@2x\"></p>\n<h4>Account abstraction: Approach #2 (Upgrading smart contracts)</h4>\n<br />\n<p>With this approach, we upgrade contract accounts so they can approve transactions and pay gas fees (just like EOAs). This provides another route to achieving account abstraction by introducing “supercharged contracts” that can act as EOAs (ie. account contracts). Plus, it solves a pressing problem in Ethereum: lack of support for contract wallets at the protocol level.</p>\n<p>You see—some smart contract wallets already exist today and provide many benefits of account abstraction. But using these wallets can be incredibly difficult because Ethereum treats smart contracts as “second-class citizens” and requires all transactions to start from an EOA.</p>\n<p>This limitation also means smart contract wallets lack the trustlessness and self-custodial nature of EOA wallets like MetaMask. For context, let’s consider the flow of creating and using a smart contract wallet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy a new contract account</li>\n<li>Send transactions to call functions on your wallet contract</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem is already obvious: you now need to manage <em>two</em> wallets. Why? An EOA (pre-funded with ETH) needs to cover the costs of deploying the wallet and calling necessary functions afterwards.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5XK58qVenLHV7UGNNKRdVa/91dcd7ace7322c1365848946694aea3a/Interacting_with_a_smart_contract_wallet_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Interacting with a smart contract wallet@2x\"></p>\n<p>Enter relayers: EOAs that can pay for your wallet’s transactions in exchange for a fee. Smart contract wallet providers will often run relayers to subsidize transactions for users. That is, the relayer pays ETH from its wallet to cover your transaction fees and recoups the costs by charging you elsewhere—perhaps in fiat or some other token.</p>\n<p>This system works fine in most cases: you can create and use a contract wallet without worrying too much about the intricacies of paying for gas. However, it also requires <em>trusting</em> the relayer not to censor or tamper with your transactions.</p>\n<p>But this is crypto, and we like <em>trustless</em> systems.</p>\n<p>By letting contract accounts approve transactions and pay gas fees, account abstraction makes the process of creating and using a smart contract wallet more trustless. To be specific, it allows anyone that runs a relayer to execute transactions on your behalf. You just need to sign a message approving the relayer to deduct funds from your wallet balance after executing the transaction:</p>\n<p>Now the flow of using a smart contract wallet looks somewhat different:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying a wallet contract? By <a href=\"https://blog.goodaudience.com/one-weird-trick-to-fix-user-on-boarding-d54b7ff9d711\">using counterfactual deployment workflows</a>, you can send funds to the contract account <em>before</em> deploying it and pay a relayer’s EOA for deployment costs from your wallet’s balance.</li>\n<li>Interacting with a wallet contract? Sign a message off-chain and have a relayer make the call to your account contract. The message will include an instruction for the account contract to refund the relayer’s gas costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/em7IHsWzZOfVexI1E38KT/da6a12273d0d8284d58454cae259c3e3/Interacting_with_a_smart_contract_wallet_via_a_relayer_2x.jpg\" alt=\"Interacting with a smart contract wallet via a relayer@2x\"></p>\n<p>This idea of enabling <em>trustless</em> and <em>censorship-resistant</em> smart accounts underpins many account abstraction proposals in this category. For example, ERC-4337—the most popular account abstraction proposal yet—decentralizes relayers by introducing an alternate mempool where users can submit contract wallet transactions for processing.</p>\n<p>In this case, relayers (called “bundlers”) can compete to execute smart account transactions, reducing the risk of censorship or over-reliance on wallet providers. Below is an infographic showing different account abstraction proposals in the “give smart contracts EOA features” camp, including their key features, and status of implementation:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5npUM2AWmg9l8iueDbkp1s/5f94b1a08360e2eca6dd253336aa5edc/Account_abstraction_proposals__II__2x.jpg\" alt=\"Account abstraction proposals (II)@2x\"></p>\n<h3>On the future of account abstraction</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Years after Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/07/05/on-abstraction\">first introduced the concept</a>, there’s still some disagreement about the best way to implement account abstraction. For example, implementing <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074\">EIP-3074</a> and <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5003\">EIP-5003</a> would enable existing EOAs (including MetaMask users) to upgrade to smart accounts. But these proposals require a hard fork which, given the community’s focus on more pressing upgrades, seems infeasible for now.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337\">EIP-4337</a> has received broad support as it implements account abstraction without requiring large-scale changes to the Ethereum protocol. But for users currently using EOA-based wallets, it means having to move assets from an EOA to a newly deployed contract account—a potentially complex and costly process, given high gas fees on Ethereum today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/J4Bls1oUe5cR34hpklAvM/5bdffbc407331560ab957519c2cf3ebe/account-abstraction-meme.jpg\" alt=\"account-abstraction-meme\"></p>\n<p>At MetaMask, we believe account abstraction is key to providing a seamless onboarding experience for new web3 users. We also know that EOAs cannot guarantee crypto’s adoption (“The next billion users won’t write 12 words on a paper,” as Ethereum Foundation researcher Yoav Weiss colorfully puts it.).</p>\n<p>As such, we have begun thinking of ways to deliver the benefits of account abstraction without compromising on the MetaMask wallet users know and love. Part of this effort includes turning to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>—the permissionless innovation platform that allows developers to build custom features on top of existing MetaMask infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Using Snaps, developers can extend the functionality of your MetaMask wallet to support different account abstraction use cases.

To quote one of our own, Taylor Monahan, “A shipped half-solution is still better than an unshipped perfect solution.”</p>\n<p>Which is why our next article on the topic of account abstraction will take the form of a deep dive into the details of ERC-4337. Importantly, we’ll discuss how web3 developers can start building the future of account abstraction and onboard the next billion users—one line of code at a time—with MetaMask.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Patrick McCorry, Simon Brown, Mirko Garozzo, Christian Montoya, Oliver Renwick, and Megan Dias for feedback on earlier drafts of this article.
