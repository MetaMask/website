Decoding methods and arguments is a good first step, but if users interact with a malicious contract, the visible information can be misleading. To counterbalance this, I thought about showing quantitative data, in a very simple manner, using code colors 🟥 🟧 🟩. The idea is to show a trust score based on data that is easy to verify from multiple sources. I chose to start with 4 criterias:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many users have interacted with the smart-contract overall.</li>\n<li>How often the current account has interacted with this contract.</li>\n<li>How old this contract is.</li>\n<li>Has this contract code been verified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<h4>The insights main function</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The snap is very simple, and is easy to extend. Here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/Tbaut/template-snap-monorepo\">code</a> that we will go through.</p>\n<p>When the insights tab is clicked on MetaMask, the <code>onTransaction</code> function is called. Inide it, we call each function diving us the criteria that we decided to take into account.</p>\n<pre><code>type ScoreResult = {\n  score: number;\n  description: string;\n};\n\nconst onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({\n  transaction,\n  chainId,\n}) => {\n  // call all the insights criteria\n  // they all return a ScoreResult\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those functions generally call an api, and process the results. Let’s dig into one of these to understand.</p>\n<h4>Determine a trust score based on overall interactions</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Let’s dig in the function giving a score based on the total amount of transaction that a contract received. We use the Etherscan api here, but any other api could work to verify the same data.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Gets a trust score for a contract based on the overall tx count\n * 3 -> the contract had overall >=100 txs\n * 2 -> the contract had overall 50 &#x3C;= tx &#x3C; 99\n * 1 -> the contract had overall tx &#x3C; 50\n *\n *@param options0\n * @param options0.chainId - the chain id to call the api with\n * @param options0.contractAddress - the contract address to check\n * @returns the score and a description\n */\nexport async function getContractTransactionCountScore({\n  chainId,\n  contractAddress,\n}: IContractTransactionCountScore): Promise&#x3C;ScoreResult> {\n  // get the api url asking for the 100th transaction\n  // it will return undefined if there is none\n  const url100 = getEtherscanContractTxsUrl({\n    txNumber: 100,\n    chainId,\n    contractAddress,\n  });\n  const { result: result100 } = await fetchUrl&#x3C;EtherscanResponse>(url100);\n\n  // if there is a 100th tx it means the contract\n  // has received at least 100 txs. We have all we need\n  // we can return with the best score of 3\n  if (result100.length === 1) {\n    return {\n      score: 3,\n      description: 'more than 100 txs',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // this will be call if there are less than 100 txs\n  // we check if there is a 50th tx.\n  const url50 = getEtherscanContractTxsUrl({\n    txNumber: 50,\n    chainId,\n    contractAddress,\n  });\n  const { result: result50 } = await fetchUrl&#x3C;EtherscanResponse>(url50);\n\n  // if there is a 50th tx we can return with a score of 2\n  if (result50.length === 1) {\n    return {\n      score: 2,\n      description: 'more than 50 txs',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // otherwise, return with the lowest score\n  return {\n    score: 1,\n    description: 'fewer than 50 txs',\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Not all scores are equal</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Now that we have a <code>TrustResult</code> for each of our criteria, it is time to apply weights. Indeed, not all of our criterias trust score should have the same weight. For instance, the amount of past transactions with the contract has a cost. If a scammer was willing to game it, it would cost them some ETH for gas. As a result, this criteria is considered more costly to game, hence more important, I gave it a weight of 3.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the contract’s age cannot be circunvented by an attacker, they would have to deploy it, and then wait before launching their attack if they wanted to have a high trust score. I gave it a weight of 2.</p>\n<p>The other criterias are considered weaker and have a weight of 1.</p>\n<pre><code>// arbitrary weight for each score\nconst Weights = {\n  contractTransactionCountScore: 3,\n  contractAgeScore: 2,\n  contractVerificationScore: 1,\n  contractUserTransactionScore: 1,\n};\n\n// calculate the overall trust score after applying the weights\nconst calculateOverallScoreWithWeight = ({\n  contractTransactionCountScore,\n  contractUserTransactionScore,\n  contractAgeScore,\n  contractVerificationScore,\n}: CalculateOverallScoreWithWeightArgs) => {\n  const totalWeitght = Object.values(Weights).reduce(\n    (acc: number, curr: number) => acc + curr,\n    0,\n  );\n\n  const overallScoreWithWeight =\n    (contractUserTransactionScore.score * Weights.contractUserTransactionScore +\n      contractTransactionCountScore.score *\n        Weights.contractTransactionCountScore +\n      contractAgeScore.score * Weights.contractAgeScore +\n      contractVerificationScore.score * Weights.contractVerificationScore) /\n    totalWeitght;\n\n  return Math.floor(overallScoreWithWeight);\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Present the final score</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Finally, we now have the trust score of a smart contract, we need to show it in a simple manner. The MetaMask insights api only allows to show key value pairs. The keys are in bold, and the values have a reglar font weight. I figured that by using emojis, I could create an interface that is not intimidating to users, while still showing all the information gathered.</p>\n<p>The function transforming the trust score into emojis:</p>\n<pre><code>const getColor = (result: number) => {\n  switch (result) {\n    case 3:\n      return '🟩';\n    case 2:\n      return '🟧';\n    default:\n      return '🟥';\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the return part of the <code>onTransaction</code> function, with some hacks to show key values, in a nice way:</p>\n<pre><code>return {\n    insights: {\n      '': `Trust score: ${getColor(overallScore)}`,\n      ' ': '-----------------------------',\n      'Contract popularity': `${getColor(\n        contractTransactionCountScore.score,\n      )} ${contractTransactionCountScore.description}`,\n      'Previous interactions': `${getColor(\n        contractUserTransactionScore.score,\n      )} ${contractUserTransactionScore.description}`,\n      'Contract age': `${getColor(contractAgeScore.score)} ${\n        contractAgeScore.description\n      }`,\n      'Contract verification': `${getColor(contractVerificationScore.score)} ${\n        contractVerificationScore.description\n      }`,\n    },\n  };\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, I created a very simple interface to call 2 types of contracts, one very well known and used Uniswap contract, and one very recently deployed storage contract, the one presented by default on Remix. I you were to use this snap and interract with the <a href=\"https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45\">Uniswap router contract</a> you would see the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/aTUNnd3NE3KYsfkMIxEsE/6f79c40caed890a21e87de6a529f0e31/Screenshot_2023-05-25_at_6.24.47_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 6.24.47 PM\"></p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>This is only scratching the surface of what information could give user confidence, or prevent them from being phished. The obvious first step would be to use more sources for our data. The contract verification already use Sourcify and Etherscan, but it would be better to use multiple sources for each criteria.</p>\n<p>Then, we should apply more advanced algorithm to prevent scammers from being able to game the scores easiely. For instance, we should count the amount of unique accounts who transacted with a contract. We could do some anaysis on the accounts that interacted with it in the past as well, to make sure they are not all originating from one source. The down-side is that all this analysis is harder to make using multiple sources of truth.</p>\n<p>There are some interesting research as well done on scam detection for smart contract that could be integrated. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07220.pdf\">More info here</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, the overwelming amount of positive reactions I received for this hack shows that users are demending for some more information, and I believe that the fact that it is easy to digest played a key role.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>I am a software engineer at ChainSafe and I worked at Parity in the past. I love to build products with a focus on good UX. Web3 is a great playground for me because everything is so complex, trying to make it understandable to as many ppl as possible is a great challenge. I have been in the space for almost 5 years and although I have attended many hackathons, I am generally a volonteer, a mentor or a judge rather than a hacker. The main reason is that I am a perfectionist and generally don’t like quick and dirty solutions :).</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, my colleagues at ChainSafe have built one of the first ever snap, the one for Filecoin. I probably had a look at the code back then, but did not dig further.</p>\n<p>At the time of hacking, the insights api wasn’t actually available to developers. I was talking to the MetaMask team in Lisbon, I did not expect to be able to add a user interface to MetaMask. They told me that it was about to be released, and that I could build on it now. In fact this was only available with a custom build, and the documentation hadn’t been released yet.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>Having the ability to add custom code in a tab, while making sure that this code is safe to execute opens the doors to a huge range of enhancements. I’m very much looking forward to what will come out of this.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you?</strong></p>\n<p>The template monorepo made it a breath to get started. The fact that all my code could be written in one repo, with one command to launch both the test dapp and the snap, both with auto-refresh was a great developer experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What does Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s the extension to an extension.

One area in which we see progress is account abstraction. It feels like there is a new naming service almost every week. The goal of these is to simplify the way we interact with each other in this space: names are more recognizable than wallet addresses and therefore build a base layer for identity and reputation systems.</p>\n<p>Additionally, original (naming) standards can benefit the popularity of projects. For example, let us call a project “x”. The new naming standard this project proposes could be called x-domains or x-names. Success in the project would automatically help grow the naming service, while success in the naming service would do the same for the project - a win-win. Now, we are left with a fragmented picture of the namespace. Sure, there are people that try to use every naming service, which results in a race around names in the limited namespace we have in some (domain-based) naming services. Other naming services use more familiar handles, like emails, phone numbers, or more general social handles (Twitter username, IG handle) that people already possess, to eliminate potential markets around these identities.\nMost people end up with one, maybe two handles from different naming services. Because of the variety of choices, developers need to integrate multiple naming service resolvers into their applications.</p>\n<p>When a new naming service takes over a sizable percentage of the market, it should also be integrated into one’s application as to not exclude users of that naming service. From the user’s perspective, searching for alternative applications with similar functionality that also support the naming service of their choice is annoying. Why not let people use whatever they are familiar with AND provide a solution that helps developers focus on creating the best application possible?</p>\n<p>The Multi-resolver Snap does exactly that.</p>\n<p><strong>Walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<h4>The gist</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The snap was built for <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-monorepo/discussions/821#top\">MetaMask Flask 10.20</a>. The current version uses the permissions <code>endowment:network-access</code> and <code>snap_confirm</code>. The first is used in a <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/multiresolver\">preliminary version</a> to request resolved addresses and translate Twitter IDs to Twitter usernames. The latter shows a confirmation screen to the user highlighting the resulting address before a transaction is created.</p>\n<p>Currently supported resolvers are IDriss and ENS. The Snap runs on localhost.</p>\n<h4>Integration from dApp side</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>For a developer to integrate this Snap, and therefore all available resolvers, one must connect to a wallet and the snap first:</p>\n<pre><code>const connectSnap = async (\n  snapId: string = defaultSnapOrigin,\n  params: Record&#x3C;'version' | string, unknown> = {},\n) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_enable',\n    params: [\n      {\n        wallet_snap: {\n          [snapId]: {\n            ...params,\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Invoking happens through the method <code>resolve_send</code> and can be called through:</p>\n<pre><code>const resolveInput = async (id_?: string) => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'resolve_send',\n        identifier: id_,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>which returns the resolved address. Here, <code>id_</code> is the identifier that the user inputs into a sending field.</p>\n<p>Using the new <code>multiChainProvider</code>, connecting to the snap is as simple as connecting to the wallet with the required permissions:</p>\n<pre><code>import { MultiChainProvider } from \"@metamask/multichain-provider\";\n\nconst provider = new MultiChainProvider();\nconst { approval } = await provider.connect({\n  requiredNamespaces: {\n    eip155: {\n      chains: [chains],\n      methods: [\n        permissions\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n});\nconst session = await approval();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above-mentioned <code>resolve_send</code> method can be renamed to <code>eth_sendTransaction</code>, allowing apps to use the Multi-resolver Snap without needing to change any integrations. Whenever <code>eth_sendTransaction</code> is called, the Snap is interposed and resolves the input before creating the transaction. Applications should allow for inputs of type <code>String</code> instead of throwing an error whenever an user input does not match an address. The snap then takes care of the rest!</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>As a next step, this snap will be taken open-source to encourage other developers to hunt for bugs, improve the code, and even add their custom resolvers. Open-sourcing will unlock the true potential of this Snap: not a single developer or entity has to integrate all emerging naming services. A <code>contribute.md</code> file promotes this process. Additionally, further development from the MetaMask Snaps team will be tracked.</p>\n<p>Precisely, two specific things greatly benefit this snap:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>endowment:transaction-insight</code> permission for account-to-account transfers to remove the additional <code>snap_confirm</code> call before a transaction is triggered, and</li>\n<li>UI injections into MetaMask. The goal is to implement the snap into the sending field so users can utilize the multi-resolver without connecting to a website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, a complete integration with the <a href=\"https://github.com/idriss-crypto/ts-library\">IDriss resolver</a> is sought. Full integration allows users to send crypto and NFTs to any email, phone number, and Twitter username without needing to be registered in the IDriss book.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/53ZvMx1js90Dskut5ygAm/dd6ca6050e755c22388b24edd1ea0eec/Screenshot_2023-05-24_at_9.37.23_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-24 at 9.37.23 AM\"></p>\n<p>My name is Lennard, and I have been interested in the blockchain space since 2017. For over a year, I have been building and co-founding <a href=\"https://www.idriss.xyz/\">IDriss</a>, a decentralized mapping of emails, phone numbers, and Twitter usernames to wallet addresses. More generally, I focus on building tools toward a more usable web3, which motivated me to build this snap.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>The Snaps team is very present at conferences this year (2022) , so I have been running into them a couple of times now. The first time I interacted with the code base was after one of their presentations at EthCC 2022 in Paris. While the features were still limited, the documentation was already promising, and I am very hopeful for the future of MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I have not seen a similar approach to including outside contributors in the development of wallets yet. While some other wallets have open-sourced their code, Snaps enable developers to expand the functionality of MetaMask directly. I am sure this approach will be adopted by other projects as well, as it can be better maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>It was a great opportunity to build this snap during a hackathon. Having the MetaMask Snaps team around helped whenever questions came up. One thing that is still missing is the ability to customize MetaMask’s UI. Additionally, some dependency issues are hard to debug, which takes over most of the development time.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Snaps provide a playground for developers to integrate their projects or ideas directly into MetaMask in a permissionless way. For me, this means that the growth of any project can be accelerated, as users can suddenly enjoy more benefits using the tools (wallets) they already own.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Snaps can help prevent scams through transaction insights, create a more network-inclusive experience with keyrings, and allow for a more user-friendly web3 experience using custom resolvers paired with UI enhancements. Together, this will bring more people into the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Go to hackathons!

While the frontend is a simple web application that hosts the UI, it also acts as a companion DApp for our Snaps application.</p>\n<p>Most of the functionality is achieved in the snap, but the remaining is in the frontend to facilitate the users to request amount from others and/or configure their tags through our UI. While the <em>request amount</em> feature uses the XMTP protocol, the tagging feature uses the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snaps-json-rpc-api\">MetaMask Snaps API</a>.</p>\n<p>We have used the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">snap monorepo</a> as the template to begin with. The full implementation of our project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/shree675/FoxTagger\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>The Snaps Application</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>In our entire implementation, we make use of the following main features provided by the Snaps API:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Persistence storage</li>\n<li>Notifications</li>\n<li>Cron jobs</li>\n<li>Transaction insights</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our implementation begins by first exposing some functions to the frontend in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\index.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'getPersistentStorage':\n      return await getPersistentStorage();\n    case 'setPersistentStorage':\n      await setPersistentStorage(\n        request.params as void | Record&#x3C;string, unknown>,\n      );\n      return null;\n    case 'clearPersistentStorage':\n      await clearPersistentStorage();\n      return null;\n\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Method not found.');\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The functions <code>getPersistenceStorage</code> and <code>setPersistenceStorage</code> are very fundamental as they facilitate the storage and retrieval of tags and other information and are defined as shown in the below code snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  return await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['get'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const clearPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['clear'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const setPersistentStorage = async (\n  data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void,\n) => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['update', data],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>For all the feature implementations, we have created a suitable datastructure for our persistence storage.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"from_account0\": {\n      mainMapping: {\n        \"to_account0\": [\"tag0\",\"tag1\"],\n        ...\n      },\n      usage: {\n        \"tag0\": {\n          limit: \"100000000000\",\n          used: \"800000\",\n          notified: false\n        },\n        ...\n      },\n      latestHash: \"transaction_hash0\"\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>A user can have multiple accounts and each account has its own tags, usage and user-defined limits.</p>\n<h4>Transaction Insights</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The transaction insights feature displays the associated tags, their corresponding expenditures and alerts, if any, in an ongoing transaction.</p>\n<p>In the same <code>index.ts</code> file, we add a transaction insights handler that allows us to intercept an ongoing transaction and interact with the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n  const insights = await getDetails(transaction);\n\n  return {\n    insights,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function <code>getDetails</code> implements the entire logic for calculating the expenditure and showing alerts. This is implemented in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\transaction.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getDetails = async (transaction: Record&#x3C;string, unknown>) => {\n  const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n  const account = (transaction.from as string).toLowerCase();\n  const completeStorage = (await getPersistentStorage()) as any;\n\n  if (!completeStorage?.[account]) {\n    throw new Error('Storage initialization failed.');\n  }\n\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.mainMapping || !storage.usage) {\n    throw new Error('Data corrput. Please re-install the snap.');\n  }\n\n  const tagList = storage.mainMapping[toAddress];\n  if (!tagList?.length) {\n    return {\n      Tag: NO_TAG_MESSAGE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  let tags = '';\n  let alerts = '';\n  let usageMsg = '';\n\n  for (const tag of tagList) {\n    if (tags === '') {\n      tags += `${tag}`;\n    } else {\n      tags += `, ${tag}`;\n    }\n    let { used } = storage.usage[tag];\n    let { limit } = storage.usage[tag];\n    const fixedUsed = FixedNumber.from(used);\n    const fixedLimit = FixedNumber.from(limit);\n    const usedPercent = (\n      Number(fixedUsed.divUnsafe(fixedLimit).toString()) * 100\n    ).toFixed(2);\n    used = BigNumber.from(used);\n    limit = BigNumber.from(limit);\n\n    const amount = BigNumber.from(transaction.value as string);\n    const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gas as string);\n    const total = amount.add(gas);\n\n    if (usageMsg === '') {\n      usageMsg += `${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    } else {\n      usageMsg += ` | ${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    }\n\n    if (!limit.eq('0')) {\n      if (used.gt(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${EXCEEDED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      } else if (used.add(total).gte(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${WILL_EXCEED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (alerts === '') {\n    return {\n      Tag: tags,\n      Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {\n    Tag: tags,\n    Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    Alerts: alerts,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this, we are first checking if the current transaction’s <em>to</em> hash (or <em>to</em> address) is present in the storage. Then we retrieve and calculate the usage percentage. We then check if the usage is about to reach, or has already reached the set limit for that tag and we send an appropriate alert.</p>\n<p>Notice that we use <strong>BigNumber</strong> and <strong>FixedNumber</strong> classes available in the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers\">ethers</a> npm package to handle arithmetic operations on large numbers.</p>\n<p>Transaction insights is now complete and this is the final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/h4Vxe5SiAOs0y7vviJkND/6c637c9e70b041140ca49d14450f478e/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.22.44_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.22.44 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Cron Jobs</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Defined here are three cron jobs, <code>weeklySummary</code> for generating the summary every week, <code>checkLimits</code> to check if the user has exceeded limits on any of his/her tags and <code>updateAmount</code> that updates the usage information of new transactions performed by the user.</p>\n<p>These cron jobs are mentioned in <code>packages\\snap\\snap.manifest.json</code>, with their appropriate frequency. Additionally, a cron job handler is incorporated in <code>index.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>These functionalities are defined in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\cron.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getSummary = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n  let exceeded = false;\n  let hasTag = false;\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      hasTag = true;\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n\n      if (\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt('0')\n      ) {\n        exceeded = true;\n      }\n\n      // reset usage information for the next week\n      newUsage[tag].notified = false;\n      newUsage[tag].used = '0';\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (hasTag) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n  }\n\n  return exceeded;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we iterate through the storage and check if the user has crossed any limits on any of the tags. We then reset <code>notified</code> to <code>false</code> so that it can be reused by <code>checkLimits</code> cron job. We return a boolean value for the cron job handler to pick it up for each user account and send an appropriate notification message at the end of the week.</p>\n<pre><code>export const checkLimits = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const tags: string[] = [];\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n      const { notified } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n      if (\n        !notified &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt(BigNumber.from('0'))\n      ) {\n        tags.push(tag);\n        newUsage[tag].notified = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (tags.length > 0) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n\n    const message = `${LIMIT_ALERT_HEADER + tags.length} tags on ${compact(\n      account,\n    )}`;\n    return message;\n  }\n\n  return null;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above function, we once again iterate through all non-notified user tags and check their usage. If it has exceeded the set limit, we set <code>notified</code> to <code>true</code> so that this tag is not picked up again until the next week. We return a message to the cron job handler stating the number of tags that crossed the limit and the user’s account hash.</p>\n<p>Next, we complete the implementation for <code>updateAmount</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const updateAmount = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://api-goerli.etherscan.io/api?module=account&#x26;action=txlist&#x26;address=${account}&#x26;startblock=0&#x26;endblock=9999999999&#x26;sort=asc&#x26;apikey=${process.env.REACT_API_KEY}`,\n  );\n  const result = await response.json();\n\n  if (!result.result) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  let transactions = result.result;\n  if (transactions.length === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // sort in descending order\n  transactions = transactions.sort(\n    (a: any, b: any) => b.timeStamp - a.timeStamp,\n  );\n\n  const { latestHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  const { prevHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  if (transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  for (const transaction of transactions) {\n    if (transaction.hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n      break;\n    }\n\n    if (transaction.to !== account) {\n      const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n      const tagList = completeStorage[account].mainMapping[toAddress];\n\n      if (tagList !== null &#x26;&#x26; tagList !== undefined) {\n        for (const tag of tagList) {\n          const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gasPrice).mul(\n            BigNumber.from(transaction.gasUsed),\n          );\n          const value = BigNumber.from(transaction.value);\n          const total = gas.add(value);\n          if (prevHash !== latestHash) {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from(\n              completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used,\n            )\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          } else {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from('0')\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  completeStorage[account].prevHash = latestHash;\n  completeStorage[account].latestHash = transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase();\n\n  return completeStorage;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we use the <a href=\"https://docs.etherscan.io/v/goerli-etherscan/\">etherscan API</a> to fetch all the user transactions and update the usage details for each tag. We sort the obtained transactions in decreasing order of time and scan them from <code>latestHash</code> transaction to avoid rescanning of transactions. We finally update <code>latestHash</code>. This cron job runs more frequently than <code>checkLimits</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are a few outputs of the above implementations:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/75yjXTyGHM43SE7mfP81Km/7a2ca077862463f656efadff0ad44a9f/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.26.54_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.26.54 PM\"></p>\n<h4>The Frontend DApp</h4>\n<br /> \n<h5>Tagging Feature</h5>\n<br /> \n<p>The website has two pages. The first page is the landing page where the user can login, add/remove tags, check his/her tag usage distribution, set limits and apply filters on the tags and transactions. All of this is achieved through the familiar React.js functionality. The transactions are fetched from the previously mentioned etherscan API and the addresses are associated with their corresponding tags. This information comes from the persistence storage of the connected Snaps.</p>\n<p>The logic for most of the above features is written in <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\GetTableData.jsx</code>. The integration of the snap with the frontend is sophisticated, yet intuitive once finished.</p>\n<p>The snap methods are exposed to the frontend by writing the following functions in <code>packages\\site\\src\\utils\\snap.ts</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Get the persisted data from the snap.\n *\n * @returns The persisted data, if any, 'null' otherwise.\n */\nexport const getStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'getPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Update the persistent storage in the snap.\n *\n * @param data - The complete data to be stored.\n */\nexport const setStorage = async (data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'setPersistentStorage',\n        params: data,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Clear the persistent storage in the snap.\n */\nexport const clearStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'clearPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2\">react-chartjs-2</a> npm package to display analytics of the user’s expenditure.</p>\n<p>This is the final look of the website:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/AWO9lNPmaXnJXUEtNMXqN/c9b685ec2b2644c1ff6edbe5c3b7f85d/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.28.50_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.28.50 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Request Amount Feature</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This is a unique feature in which a user can send a notification through XMTP to another user requesting for ETH. For this, both the users need to have this snap enabled. This feature is made available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/request\">http://localhost:8000/request</a>.</p>\n<p>For this, we use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xmtp/xmtp-js\">@xmtp/xmtp-js</a> npm package to create <code>WalletContext</code> and <code>XmtpContext</code> in <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\WalletContext.tsx</code> and <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\XmtpContext.tsx</code> respectively. We also create hooks and components. Most of this code directly comes from an example in the <a href=\"https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-quickstart-react\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We create a new page, <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\request.tsx</code> in the website to accommodate the UI for this feature. We send messages using the sendMessage function from the <code>useSendMessage</code> hook.</p>\n<pre><code>import useSendMessage from '../hooks/useSendMessage';\n\nconst sendNewMessage = () => {\n    const payload = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      message: msgTxt,\n    };\n    sendMessage(JSON.stringify(payload));\n    setMsgTxt('');\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we display the received messages using the provider state of <code>XmtpContext</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import { XmtpContext } from '../contexts/XmtpContext';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n    const [providerState] = useContext(XmtpContext);\n    const { convoMessages, client } = providerState;\n\n    return (\n        &#x3C;>\n            &#x3C;ConversationList\n                convoMessages={convoMessages}\n                setSelectedConvo={setSelectedConvo}\n            />\n        &#x3C;/>\n    )\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>After following the example in the above mentioned documentation, we finally attain the required functionality:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/56ckGzBW5BnSehYheh5Eqt/8f3fa3518be25d1fefdd334ef7f1a6f9/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.31.53_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.31.53 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This completes FoxTagger, the entire project with our idea manifested into a MetaMask Snaps application, coupled with a DApp.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The next step would be to extend the tagging functionality by adding more analytics and using a Machine Learning model to make predictions and suggestions on how to minimize the user’s expenditure.\nThen we can aim to incorporate a transaction split feature where the user can split a fee among multiple accounts, adding on top of the request amount feature.</p>\n<p>Additionally, MetaMask Snap’s new custom UI functionality could be leveraged to provide a more pleasing user experience inside the snap.\nFinally, the snap can be extended to chains other than the Goerli Testnet network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6om9b00PGfNjh6CMwVGtui/708e691cdf4d127c9fcad36a5d347676/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.17.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.17.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>From ideation to implementation, our team collaborated to generate ideas, refine them, and overcome challenges to come up with our FoxTagger Snaps.</p>\n<p>Sachin Sahu played a pivotal role in developing the frontend and functionalities of the dApp. Not only did he help integrate MetaMask Snaps with the platform, but he also worked on the demo and documentation to ensure that users have all the information they need to start using the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Siddhartha G's expertise in frontend design and implementation was crucial to the development of the platform. He created intuitive frontend components and methods to present and modify data and assisted in integrating MetaMask Snaps with the dApp.</p>\n<p>Shreetesh M took charge of the backend implementation and ensured that all functions were exposed to the frontend. He implemented transaction insights and cron jobs, which helped the team integrate the backend seamlessly with the frontend.</p>\n<p>Noble Saji Mathews's contributions were instrumental in drafting the framework for transactions through on-chain messaging. He was also part of the ideation process for the tagging and transaction request system, which enhances the platform's usability and user-friendliness.</p>\n<p>Kranthi brought his unique perspective to the table by proposing the idea of the tagging system and exploring novel methods to incorporate decentralized communication. His hard work resulted in the implementation of the 'request' feature, which has revolutionized the way users interact with the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Ansh Anand's expertise in frontend design and ideation process made him an invaluable member of the team. He worked on the demo video, which showcased the platform's capabilities and helped attract more users.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>With more than 21 million active users on MetaMask, it’s kind of hard to achieve functionality that fits everybody’s needs. That's where MetaMask Snaps come in - the developer community now has more freedom to customize and personalize MetaMask based on user requirements, making it easier than ever to interact with different dApps that may be built on different blockchains or use different protocols.</p>\n<p>The benefits of MetaMask Snaps are numerous, including the ability to track expenditures over time, analyze spending, donate a small percent of each transaction to charity, request payment from clients, set up autopay for Netflix subscriptions, and much more! Integrating MetaMask with various DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and social media platforms is now a breeze with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p>But Snaps aren't just for complex financial transactions. Imagine going out to lunch with friends and paying with cryptocurrency - with MetaMask Snaps, splitting the bill and requesting payment from your friends is as simple as a single tap! That’s the power of MetaMask Snaps!</p>\n<p>As the Web3 space continues to evolve, MetaMask Snaps is sure to become an increasingly important tool for developers and users alike. With the potential of the metaverse on the horizon, the use cases of Snaps are truly endless.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>We would advise them to first go through the existing snaps on github. This will help them a lot in understanding the potential of the features provided by MetaMask Snaps, although the features look simple on paper.</p>\n<p>We would also suggest they use the existing monorepo template to start with their implementation. It has many benefits. The repo is structured very well along with linting checks and actions, developers can implement both a companion web app and a snap in one package. Moreover, the repo is always on par with the official documentation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we recommend them to post their issues or doubts on community channels and help increase their exposure to MetaMask’s Snaps.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

This post outlines what <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> is and how to submit a successful grant application.</p>\n<h3>What is MetaMask Grants DAO and how does it work?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask Grants DAO is an internal Consensys employee-led DAO that aims to foster innovation in the MetaMask ecosystem. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/building-an-extensible-world-with-metamask-grants-dao/\">Established in October 2022</a>, the DAO places an emphasis on builders and their journey to MVP.</p>\n<p>Making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world requires decentralizing efforts to build out a thriving ecosystem to empower our communities. MetaMask Grants DAO not only accelerates growth for crypto-comfortable users but also aims to promote long-term adoption among crypto-curious individuals by providing multiple pathways for participation.</p>\n<p>Every ConsenSys employee can opt-in to be a Grants DAO member with equal voting rights governed by a non-transferable token. Learn more about the DAO <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How do I apply?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>You can apply for a MetaMask grant here: <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\">https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\n</a></p>\n<p>Recipients include projects that have previously collaborated with MetaMask as well as new relationships formed as a result of the DAO.</p>\n<p>We’ll use information from a prior grant recipient, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/metamask-grants-dao-funds-agoric-and-safeheron-with-first-round-of-grants/\">Safeheron</a> as an example in this guide.</p>\n<p>To increase your chances of being funded, make sure to keep these 3 tips in mind when filling out your application:</p>\n<h4>#1 Be specific about your project and the problem you solve</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Make sure you’re able to describe your project clearly. What are your goals, why is it important, and how does it align with our mission? Does it fit into our <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/request-for-proposals\">current wish list</a>?</p>\n<p>In Safeheron’s application, they clearly stated how their project revolved around improving MetaMask’s key management experience, specifically with a focus on helping users manage their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) to reduce phishing attacks while also reducing the chance of those keys being lost.</p>\n<p>This is an extremely important issue to the MetaMask team as we prioritize user security above all else.</p>\n<p>When filling out your grant application, don’t hesitate to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data</strong>: Do you have quantitative data to illustrate the problem you’re solving?</li>\n<li><strong>Track record</strong>: What have you and your team been involved with? Have you participated in one of our hackathons? Collaborated with our team in the past? Let us know! Safeheron mentioned their previous relationship with the MetaMask and Keystone team in implementing a 2/2 MPC snap and described how a grant would fund the evolution of this into a 2/3 MPC snap.</li>\n<li><strong>Roadmap</strong>: What is your vision and what part of your roadmap and execution will our grant enable? Feel free to call out future steps, but be clear in delineating what portion of your project the grant will be funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#2 Include key milestones and a path to production</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Including milestones, timelines, and a thorough strategy helps us evaluate the feasibility of your project. And maybe we can even fund a portion of your build, so be explicit in your milestones. Be realistic when sketching this out— what targets would you measure your productivity by? What does success look like? Does it make sense to break out your path to production by dev weeks or by milestones achieved?</p>\n<p>Milestones, for example, could look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2/2 MPC solution implemented with MetaMask Flask and Keystone hardware wallet</li>\n<li>Compatible 2/3 MPC algorithm developed</li>\n<li>Designs for the 2/3 MPC experience</li>\n<li>Integration of 2/3 MPC algorithm with Flask, Keystone, and MetaMask Mobile</li>\n<li>Security review</li>\n<li>Marketing and PR preparation</li>\n<li>Launch</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#3 Clearly describe how the budget would be used</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>What would the funding go towards? What are some blocks you’re currently experiencing? Include cost breakdowns so there’s an understanding of where the grant could contribute best.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re requesting funding for $35,000 how much of that will be used for development costs, security audits, marketing, etc.? We commonly see that audit fees can be a point of pressure for teams, so feel free to get an application in, even if it’s just to cover audit costs.</p>\n<h3>Making an impact</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask Grants DAO was funded to enable and empower the developer ecosystem to keep building, innovating, and thriving. If you believe your project is making a positive impact and would benefit from a grant, we encourage you to <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\">apply for funding!</a></p>\n<p>Keep tabs on our <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> page, and stay up to date on our developer offerings on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMaskDev\">Twitter</a>. We’re looking forward to seeing what you build.</p>\n<p><em>We can’t guarantee when we will review your request or that it will get approved, but know that our team will review the application pipeline as often as we can. Thanks for being patient with us.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you to the Safeheron team for letting us use your application as an example in this guide.</em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"개발자","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/ko/news/developers/page/11/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/security/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":40,"categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","category":"developers","totalItems":66,"currentPage":11,"totalPages":17,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"지원되지 않습니다.
