The duo, employing sophisticated tactics and online aliases, are accused of accessing and laundering over 4,100 Bitcoin since August. Their extravagant expenditures included international trips, luxury items, and high-end Los Angeles and Miami rentals. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT highlighted their \"highly sophisticated social engineering attack, \"which involved impersonating support staff from Google and Gemini exchange to deceive the victim into compromising their Bitcoin keys. The stolen funds were dispersed across multiple exchanges, encompassing a complex web of transactions involving Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero. However, in leaked videos showing the attack in progress and efforts to hide the stolen funds, the alleged attackers inadvertently exposed their own identities and the details of their money laundering operation.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security on all sensitive accounts and be wary of any requests to reset or disable it, especially from unsolicited calls or messages.

Be skeptical of services that require upfront payments, or boast unrealistic success rates without verifiable track records.

The group, consisting of 13 co-conspirators, stole 3.5 million in Bitcoin and other digital assets through brute force, SIM-swapping attacks, and holding victims at gunpoint in Florida. St Felix was convicted on multiple counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, and wire fraud, and was ordered to pay 524,000 in restitution. The criminal activities spanned across the United States, from Texas to New York, between September 2022 and July 2023. The crew also engaged in laundering the stolen funds using decentralized finance tools. A co-conspirator, Jarod Gabriel Seemungal, received a 20-year sentence and was ordered to pay $4 million in restitution. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, played a crucial role in bringing the perpetrators to justice.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Individuals should enhance their digital security practices. This includes using strong, unique passwords for all accounts, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious of sharing personal information online. Additionally, consider using non-custodial wallets to store significant amounts of cryptocurrencies, as they are less vulnerable to online hacking attempts like SIM-swapping. This incident is a reminder that cryptocurrency holders, like those with traditional fiat, may face physical security threats.</p>\n<h1><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></p></h1>\n<h2><a href=\"https://x.com/MitchellAmador/status/1828110931718758690\">The Real Impact of an Onchain Hack: A Comprehensive Study of Hack Damage from 2021 to 2023</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Immunefi's Mitchell Amador talks about the challenges and opportunities in blockchain security and bug bounties.

Developed as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), it disguises itself as legitimate software through an Apple disk image, prompting users for their password and MetaMask password upon execution. The malware then steals a variety of sensitive information, including cryptocurrency wallets and browser cookies, storing them in a directory for exfiltration. Cthulhu Stealer, similar in functionality to the Atomic Stealer malware, is part of a growing trend of macOS-targeted malware, underscoring the need for vigilance among Apple users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against threats like the Cthulhu Stealer, macOS users should only download software from trusted sources such as the Apple App Store or official developer websites. Enabling built-in security features like Gatekeeper, which blocks unverified apps, and keeping the system and applications updated with the latest security patches are critical steps. Additionally, using reputable antivirus software can provide an extra layer of protection. By staying informed about potential threats and adopting these proactive security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk of malware infections and safeguard their sensitive information.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://blog.phylum.io/smuggling-malware-in-test-code/\">Fake Developer Jobs Laced with Malware</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The sophisticated malware campaign that has been targeting developers with fake job advertisements for months shows no sign of letting up The malware, disguised as a legitimate npm package named \"execution-time-async,\" installs malicious scripts that steal cryptocurrency and credentials from the victims. The attackers cleverly hid the malware within a test file, exploiting social engineering techniques to lure developers into downloading and executing the compromised package. The malware may be part of a larger social engineering campaign, with ties to North Korean state-sponsored activities.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against such software supply chain attacks, developers should exercise caution when downloading packages, especially from unofficial sources. Always verify the authenticity of job offers and be wary of requests to download software as part of the application process.

The wallet, managed with Liminal's digital asset custody services, required multiple signatories for transaction approvals, including three from WazirX and one from Liminal.

This month, the agency followed up with a more in-depth look into how these scams work and what to look out for. They often involve convincing victims to set up cryptocurrency accounts or transfer funds, ultimately stealing their money. The FBI advises job seekers to be cautious of unsolicited job offers, verify the legitimacy of employers, and avoid sharing personal or financial information with unverified sources. Victims of such scams are encouraged to report the incidents to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should express increased scrutiny of financial opportunities, such as jobs requiring them to provide initial funds, jobs that cannot be verified independently, or jobs that appear randomly. Users should avoid downloading unknown files and attempt to verify the authenticity of the persona engaging with them before continuing the conversation. Although this public service announcement is focused on scammers exploiting victims through work related to crypto, users should also be aware of attacks during the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/north-korean-hackers-are-targeting-apple-mac-devices-once-again-with-this-devious-malware-dont-fall-for-fake-job-interview-scam\">interview process</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us\">insider threats</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"보안","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: July 2024","metaDescription":"The MetaMask Security Team has been spreading the word about LavaMoat and LavaDome, has a proposal in incubation, warns about risks to those working in crypto.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"3twPyMOXFSzgquwctQV2ZV","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: June 2024","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-june-2024","subtitle":"Lots going on with our privacy policy update, new installment of the State of Security, and big news that Wallet Guard is joining Consensys!","image":{"title":"mm security june 24 ","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=webp 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5tIiSROpf5qcBqLPswYYIp/8930c27f5ab0e92eaed54683755be6e4/feature_security_.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"July 3, 2024","authors":[{"name":"Luker","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/62fvSMhDy0kIJBiWfHt0PC/d61dbf19c319dfb07eac6083c74273f1/sec_report_.png\" alt=\"Ben barres\"></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Barres\">Ben Barres</a> was instrumental in discovering the interaction of glial cells and neurons in the nervous system.</em></p>\n<h3>🦊 What We’ve Been Up To 🦊</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\"><strong>Privacy Preserving Features in MetaMask</strong></a></p>\n<p>Privacy and security go hand-in-hand and we take our users’ privacy very seriously.

SEAL researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1795055077209579838\">Pcaversaccio believes signature phishing is the biggest problem in our industry</a>, stating users don’t care about the warnings and they consider the consequences of signing them. <a href=\"https://dune.com/tayvano/sha-zhu-pan\">MetaMask's @tayvano revealed a total estimate of $600M+ in damages from approval phishing scams since 2021.</a></p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users can protect themselves by following three primary steps. (1) Limit the assets of the wallet you browse daily with. If you sign a malicious signature, the impact will be minimized. (2) Validate the domain the signature request originates from and verify it matches the domain of the original project. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the project's official social media or blog page and check that the domains from these profiles match the request. (3) Validate the token and address contents of the request. The request will often involve a token you did not intend to send. The <code>spender</code> address and or the <code>to</code> address of the transactions will be different than the address you intended. These simple checks can save you from unintended fund loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/299099/attacker-sends-nearly-24000-phishing-emails-derived-from-compromised-coingecko-third-party-email-platform\"><strong>23K Phishing Emails Sent After CoinGeko's 3rd-Party Email Service is Compromised</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, experienced a data breach on June 5 due to a compromised account at their third-party email marketing platform, GetResponse. An attacker accessed nearly 2 million contacts and sent 23,723 phishing emails from another client's account within GetResponse. The breach exposed users' names, emails, IP addresses, and locations, but CoinGecko's user accounts and passwords remained secure. CoinGecko is investigating the breach with GetResponse, informing affected users, and reviewing security procedures to enhance protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It’s recommended that users use caution when approaching emails about claim airdrops or tokens. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Crypto projects should be aware of the security controls used by the third-party vendors they are collaborating with.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://slowmist.medium.com/unraveling-how-a-malicious-extension-stole-a-million-dollars-e847a83cc50e\">\nSlowMist Reveals How a Malicious Aggr Chrome Extension Stole $1M+ in Crypto</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Aggr, marketed as a trading data aggregator, is a Chrome extension. In early June, a Binance user reported a loss of US$1 million in cryptocurrency, which was traced back to the Aggr plugin as the attack vector. SlowMist uncovered that Aggr harvested the cookies of traders utilizing the extension, specifically targeting cookies associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. With these cookies, the malicious actors behind Aggr were able to gain entry to Centralized Exchange (CEX) portals and take control of the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It's crucial for users to be vigilant when downloading any software onto their computers, including applications from browser stores. Researching the developers of extensions is an important step in ensuring safety. A simple review of their personal profile or recent track record should give you a good gauge of whether you can trust them. Developers who are anonymous or have no previous history available should be avoided in favor of those who are verified and reputable. Additionally, reviewing the app may give you more insight into its credibility.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"보안","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: June 2024","metaDescription":"Lots going on with our privacy policy update, new installment of the State of Security, and big news that Wallet Guard is joining Consensys!","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/ko/news/security/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/","/news/security/"],"limit":4,"skip":0,"categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","category":"security","totalItems":33,"currentPage":1,"totalPages":9,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"지원되지 않습니다.
