In addition, he highlighted two impactful projects that MetaMask is working on: <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>, which extends the capabilities of MetaMask in a secure environment, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOTEJy_FqIA\">LavaMoat</a>, a tool that provides runtime protections within the JavaScript ecosystem to enhance security.</p>\n<p>Harry emphasized the importance of balancing security with functionality in smart contract design. Given the immutable nature of smart contracts, security should be prioritized, and any increase in functionality should be tested rigorously to prevent potential attack vectors. Gradually raising the limit of value locked within a new smart contract was suggested as a possible approach to enhance user protection.</p>\n<p>When asked about best practices for secure smart contract development, Harry suggested several key considerations, including prioritizing secure design principles, utilizing trusted libraries like OpenZeppelin, fostering a security-oriented mindset among developers, implementing comprehensive testing, and engaging professional code reviews. He stressed the importance of continuous education about common security risks and staying informed about the latest industry developments.</p>\n<p><strong>Herman Junge to Introduce Menpo at <a href=\"https://defisecuritysummit.org/\">DeFi Security Summit 2023</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🎙️ Speaker Announcement! 🎉<br><br>Join us at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFiSecuritySummit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DeFiSecuritySummit</a> to hear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bentobox19_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bentobox19_</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MetaMask</a> talk about<br><br>“Menpo - DeFi Incident Database”<br><br>Stay tuned for more updates on our lineup! 🌟<br><br>🌐 More info: <a href=\"https://t.co/y0e0t2SR5M\">https://t.co/y0e0t2SR5M</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AF9xM7UxY4\">pic.twitter.com/AF9xM7UxY4</a></p>&mdash; Defi Security Summit (@summit_defi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/summit_defi/status/1672179186117771264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>At the DeFi Security Summit in Paris on the 15th of July, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bentobox19_\">Herman Junge</a> will introduce Menpo, a project that utilizes <a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html\">STIX 2.1</a> to standardize DeFi incidents. This initiative promotes the sharing of threat intelligence among security analysts and researchers. Such standardization allows for more efficient allocation of resources towards information security tasks and training initiatives.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this approach fosters the development of a cross-organizational threat intelligence entity, enabling the real-time sharing of incident reports as they unfold.

With Zbigniew Tenerowicz</a> for DevSecConf24</strong>\n&#x3C;br/ ></p>\n<p>In his talk, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naugtur\">Zbigniew Tenerowicz (ZB)</a> tackled the challenging question of whether to run or not  code from strangers. Despite the inherent risks, he acknowledged that it's a practice that's regularly undertaken in the tech world. He explored the realm of JavaScript projects, particularly examining how they can proactively safeguard themselves from supply chain attacks. This proactive defense was discussed under the assumption that a downloaded dependency has already shipped with a malicious dependency. ZB suggested methods such as restricting access to globals for each package and controlling a package's ability to access the network or file system.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he addressed the important issue of eradicating prototype pollution, a common vulnerability in JavaScript projects. ZB also turned his attention to future JavaScript features, particularly those currently under discussion in TC39. He demonstrated how these emerging features can be harnessed to protect projects in the present. To provide a more practical understanding, ZB offered an engaging live demonstration, showing how to execute actual malware safely, thus emphasizing the importance and effectiveness of the defensive measures discussed.</p>\n<p><strong>Gal Weizman on LavaMoat</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MetaMask 🦊 is an amazing app for many reasons.<br><br>One reason I like especially is that even though it works just fine, the window object of the app is (almost) unusable!<br><br>If you&#39;re into Browser JavaScript security, come learn about what we call &quot;scuttling&quot; - by LavaMoat 🌋<br><br>Well.. <a href=\"https://t.co/uJ8oLxVizH\">pic.twitter.com/uJ8oLxVizH</a></p>&mdash; Gal Weizman (@WeizmanGal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeizmanGal/status/1674751159003914240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/weizmangal\">Gal Weizman</a> writes about the unique security feature implemented by MetaMask called \"<a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/360\">scuttling</a>\" via a homegrown tool named LavaMoat. The tool is designed to protect against supply chain attacks, a serious concern due to the complex graph of dependencies that MetaMask runs on. LavaMoat achieves this by creating a separate sandbox for each dependency using Secure ECMAScript (SES) by Agoric. Each sandboxed dependency is only granted access to the specific features it needs, preventing unexpected access to sensitive features.</p>\n<p>However, there's a chance that a dependency might manage to escape its sandbox using allowed APIs and reach the window object, potentially negating LavaMoat's protection. To counter this, MetaMask uses Compartments, also implemented in SES, to ensure that API instances provided to the sandboxes aren't the original ones from the global object. Consequently, unused original APIs can be removed from the global object, enhancing security by denying escaped dependencies access to unauthorized APIs.</p>\n<p>This process of removing APIs and properties from the global object is termed \"scuttling.\" It effectively makes the window object unusable but doesn't affect the app's functionality. Though theoretically sound, the application is challenging in practice, with certain properties still not scuttled. The MetaMask team provides further resources on scuttling and LavaMoat for those interested.</p>\n<h3>Security Laboratory</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>LavaMoat Update</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More LavaMoat awareness: In addition to the DevSecConf24 above, a video on the same topic will be available July 5 from <a href=\"https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/i-run-code-from-the-internet\">React Summit 2023 on Git Nation</a>, also presented by Zbyszek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a deep-dive into RN iOS native animation source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/docs/issues/9\">previous</a> investigation, the cause of assertion macros failing on parent and child nodes (thrown as exceptions executing the UI block) stems from failed WebView page loads upon navigation (also triggered by @babel/plugin-transform-runtime’s regenerator).

This approach maintains the unchanged layers above the loaders, enabling most features such as treeshaking to operate seamlessly.

That's been kind of a repeating pattern … Delegatable lets you do anything you can do on a contract to another account. It's got an open-ended caveat system so you can attenuate the ability you're sharing in any way you want. And that can let you keep hot wallets cooler by limiting what they can do while allowing them to still do stuff on chain.”</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMqaCGxSRQY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>JS Realms, Security Blank Spot by Gal Weizman</strong></p>\n<p>Join Gal as he discusses the increasing dangers of supply chain attacks that are associated with dependencies, and how Snow JS can help cover your back!</p>\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evolution of the web</li>\n<li>The importance of security and visibility</li>\n<li>Third-party solutions</li>\n<li>JavaScript Realms</li>\n<li>Snow JS</li>\n</ul>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5XHgC55n10\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br /> \n<h3>Watch out for airdrop scams!</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>There has been a lot of dubious activity surrounding airdrops recently. MetaMask published an article in February about the dangers of <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407169552667-Scammers-and-Phishers-Rugpulls-and-airdrop-scams\">rugpulls and airdrops</a>, and we’d like to remind you that, as exciting as “free money” sounds, there are a number of ways that bad actors can use the practice to their advantage.</p>\n<p>Always make sure you're getting your information from the source. When unfounded rumors started popping up on social media that MetaMask was going to be taking a snapshot and/or airdrop on March 31, we alerted the community.
