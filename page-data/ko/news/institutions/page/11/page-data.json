Bornman","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<blockquote>\n<h2>“Nothing is More Powerful than an Idea Whose Time has Come” – Victor Hugo</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hello Friends, Funds, and DAOs,</p>\n<p>As many if not most of you would know, Institutional Crypto is all-consuming. However, as my previous update denoted, my aim is to pause and provide a reflection on a quarterly basis, noting the features released and product milestones achieved within MetaMask Institutional (MMI).</p>\n<p>Since the ICO days of 2017, there has often been a continued narrative of institutions investing in what is now called Web3. Yet, institutional capital was relatively elusive for the first few years. The DeFi summer proved that this time was different, and what we have seen over the last two years is an avalanche of VC, Crypto Fund and Hedge Fund capital flooding into Web3 and DeFi. Also, we have started to see more and more traditional organisations allocating to NFTs. As the great Marc Andreessen noted, software is eating the world. Perhaps, we would add a modifier: Web3 is eating the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” – Charles Dickens</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This first quarter of this year marked another profound period—Sadly, mired in international conflict. Geopolitical uncertainty, threats of high inflation, and stagnant economic growth impacted digital assets over January and February. Yet, despite these extreme conditions, we continue to see robust institutional flows into our ecosystem. New <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/pantera-capitals-blockchain-fund-has-1b-in-commitments/\">funds are being raised</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/galaxy-digital-facilitates-goldman-sachs-s-first-otc-crypto-options-trade-830533375.html\">traditional finance is starting to invest more</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/09/24/british-museum-to-sell-nfts-of-200-hokusai-worksincluding-the-great-wave\">organisations of all stripes</a> are taking steps into Web3. From MMI’s purview, we experienced record growth across all regions in Q1 along with record assets invested into DeFi by TVL.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed” – William Gibson</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Web3 is a paradigm shift. A better way to organise society. DeFi, for example, offers capital markets that are interoperable and transparent with near-zero costs and instant settlement. NFTs are a profound way to create and store value. Underlying these products are smart contracts and ERC standards and the first principled value and philosophy of decentralisation. An idea whose time has come. Given this wave of innovation, our goal within MetaMask Institutional is to bridge every organisation on planet earth into Web3.</p>\n<p>To create a mental model, we see Web3 as the Southbank of London or the island of Manhattan—With most institutions living in Web2 on the Northbank, or other islands metaphorically speaking. In order to ferry institutional traffic from Web2 to Web3, we build more bridges (i.e. integrations with world-class custodians) to connect these two worlds. We fortify our bridges with features to serve the needs of institutional traffic (i.e. our Portfolio Dashboard, KYT risk management, and detailed reporting). We are also seeing an explosion of new organisations (DAOs) born in Web3, with similar institutional needs—And we also look to offer our bridges to these entities to connect them to the ever-increasing opportunities that DeFi provides.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“We need a product that our customers love” – Marty Cagan</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the quarter we delivered on <strong>three key initiatives</strong>; All with the aim to increase the number of bridges and fortify them with institutional features.</p>\n<h2>Unrivaled EVM access and bridging for custodial accounts</h2>\n<p>MMI—like the original non-custodial MetaMask wallet—offers its users access to DeFi and Web3 across all EMV-compatible chains. MMI differs from the original MetaMask in that it is a custodial wallet. This means that custodians and custody technology providers facilitate key storage, key management, transaction signatures, and transaction broadcasting for MMI users, in line with institutional regulations.</p>\n<p>Given that it is the custodians who broadcast the transactions—the actual EVM chain access of MMI users is determined by the chains supported by their custodian. In practice for example, if a custodian only supports transactions on the Ethereum mainnet and Polygon network, then an MMI user would be limited to transacting across these two chains. Accordingly, we rolled out our multi-chain feature that will support our custodian partners in rolling out more EVM chain access. This will give custodians the capabilities to add, sign, and broadcast any custom RPC URL specified by the user—making the rollout of new EVM chain support much easier.</p>\n<p>The ability to bridge assets is a fundamental institutional need within DeFi. This entails performing a cross-chain swap by depositing an asset into a bridge contract in one chain and then receiving minted assets on another chain. Bridging allows the ability to move assets to APY and unlocks yield farming opportunities across EVM chains.</p>\n<p>Based on the way many custodians are architected meant that MMI, historically, has connected one account to one network. This means that institutions would set up an account at a custodian and then have that account tied to a particular network, for example, Mainnet or Polygon. This one to one relationship, although providing access, prevents the bridging of assets. For assets to be bridged, the address used to deposit tokens into the bridge contract must be the same to receive the minted tokens.</p>\n<p>With our multichain feature, we removed the connection between accounts and networks historically held by custodial accounts. This means that similar to MetaMask, custodial accounts on MMI will be available across multiple networks. As our custodian partners roll out more EVM-chain support, users will automatically have access to accounts on these chains, with no additional work required from either party—allowing for the bridging of assets across chains.</p>\n<h2>Standardized custodian integration architecture</h2>\n<p>To address the different custody needs of all organisations seeking to enter the DeFi and Web3 space, MetaMask Institutional practises custodian-agnosticism. This means we work with multiple custodians that offer different custody technology stacks. It is our goal to ensure that the integration of any custodian is fast, seamless, and requires the lowest development effort possible.</p>\n<p>At the start of January, we launched our V2 JSON-RPC API Integration Architecture.</p>\n<p>This latest version allows us to compress integration steps and dramatically simplify the onboarding of new custodians by standardising our integration stack. We have also aligned the API custodians need to build with the JSON-RPC API, an open-source standard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aw5ILK0gAyyYvfJGT2CCd/89feb34616214bea720fffa375f11980/MMI-Custodian-Integration.png\" alt=\"MMI-Custodian-Integration\"></p>\n<p>While integration still requires minimal bespoke work from the MMI team, new custodians can now integrate with a standard API and client. This movement towards a “self-service” model has allowed for multiple custodians to integrate simultaneously during the last quarter.</p>\n<p>In addition, aligning our custodian API with an open-source JSON-RPC standard transforms our stack into a platform that developers can build and innovate on top of. It also aligns MMI’s architecture closely with that of MetaMask and Infura. With the JSON-RPC API, custodians could eventually write <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html\">snaps</a> for MMI and MetaMask while Infura developers can build and launch custodians and custodian services.</p>\n<h2>The Portfolio Dashboard</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png\" alt=\"MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch\"></p>\n<p>At the start of the quarter, we launched the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI Portfolio Dashboard</a>. A new canvas upon which we can build tailored institutional user experiences. We see this dashboard as another bridge and, eventually, an execution layer to Web3. The Portfolio Dashboard is a special privileged dapp. It recognises MMI wallets and then brings in all your accounts (Default, Hardware Wallet and Custodial) to provide a consolidated view of all your holdings across all EVMs. As Reid Hoffman noted, if you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. Standing on principles, our initial launch showed token holdings and historical balances across Mainnet, Polygon and BSC. A minimal viable product if you will.</p>\n<p>Over the quarter we rolled out a series of dramatic improvements to the Portfolio Dashboard. Today, we show pool balances and DeFi holdings across all EVMs with token, lending and borrowing LP, farming, leveraged farming, rewards tokens, governance, staked and yield and other positions. We also provide detailed lending and borrowing positions including APYs, APRs, health factors and interest earned and owned. Lastly, we rolled out CSV downloading of transaction history. We ended the quarter with a minimum lovable product. One that only contains a true consolidated view but offers great UX and design with minimal latency.</p>\n<p>Next, we will be rolling out detailed NFT views and LP positions, along with updating our CSV download with more granularity. We also have many features planned over the Q2 and Q3 as we build our Portfolio Dashboard into a product users can’t live without.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” – Albert Einstein</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted previously, we follow strict product and design principles within MMI, identifying what we define as tier-1 user needs. Painkillers over vitamins if you will. One of our product principles is to get outside of the building (thus many of you have been on calls with us). We thank you for your dedicated time. We follow the principles of continuous discovery and pay close attention to your voice.

These offerings provide organizations with the institutional controls they need to be able to securely engage in DeFi and web3.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, MMI <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">integrated with three custodians</a> and custody technology providers, developed a standardized custodian integration process and premium experience, and released <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-introduces-multichain-capabilities/\">multichain access for custodial accounts</a>. These new partnerships give organizations a wide variety of custody solutions to choose from, and the new multichain feature enables organizations to access and bridge digital assets across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains through their custodians—a profound offering for institutions, <a href=\"https://insights.consensys.io/webinar-new-frontiers-in-institutional-defi\">unlocking access to L2s and sidechains</a>.</p>\n<p>The MMI DeFi and Web3 Portfolio Dashboard is the next milestone we’ve reached in order to improve our investors’ experience. As more and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/institutional-defi-milestones-a-2021-review/\">more leading institutions take meaningful steps into the ecosystem</a>, they will require a unified dashboard that streamlines portfolio management and investment activities.</p>\n<p>“The Portfolio Dashboard is an institutional canvas created by the MMI team. It allows us to solve the most important needs for organisations, build a rich and tailored product and user experience, and rapidly innovate within DeFi and web3 ”—Johann Bornman, Product Lead of MetaMask Institutional</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4qunWSg7kaIaBoxIgRD1a6/bb45bfed807fa760b37addead228ae47/MMI-Portfolio-Clipped.png\" alt=\"MMI-Portfolio-Clipped\"></p>\n<p>This is the ecosystem’s first DeFi-focused dashboard for organizations. While today, there are dashboards that cater to retail and high net worth users, and advanced portfolio management systems for institutional centralized finance traders—MMI’s dashboard has been uniquely designed to cater to organizations engaging in DeFi and web3.</p>\n<p>We accomplish this by providing a consolidated view of DeFi assets across the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, and BSC chains, with more EVMs to follow. We break down an organization’s DeFi portfolio and portray the data on one dashboard with time-weighted portfolio returns.</p>\n<p>In addition, through the Portfolio Dashboard decentralized application (dapp), the MMI team is able to create smart contracts to further expand DeFi functionalities—something impossible to do on the browser extension. So really, the launch of the dapp is only the beginning.</p>\n<p>The MMI team is building the features that organizations demand with a path to merging some of these features into the core MetaMask wallet—while the core MetaMask team continues to ensure the best decentralized experience for the broadest audience.</p>\n<h2>What is the MetaMask Institutional Portfolio Dashboard?</h2>\n<p>The Portfolio Dashboard is an expanded investor interface that provides a holistic overview of an organization’s portfolio, portfolio performance, individual assets, and historical transactions.</p>\n<p>It is accessible as a dapp with permissioned privileges for MMI’s clients, hence, it will only work with MMI wallets. The dapp uses an RPC command to pull data from an organization’s accounts across all EVM networks held within an MMI wallet.</p>\n<p>The dapp includes a consolidated view of all tokens held across all networks, as well as a detailed token holding screen that includes performance, cost basis, and profit and loss. Investors will also be able to execute token swaps and obtain a detailed transaction history.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4RxLNUFH9nOsUwPgi9GDsv/692f17d289cb123c3563edc825819dda/MMI-Mainnet.png\" alt=\"MMI-Mainnet\"></p>\n<p>We liken the Portfolio Dashboard to a blank canvas because the interface allows the MMI team to build out further DeFi and web3 functionalities that will increase the scope of interactions accessible by organizations.</p>\n<p>Over the next two weeks we will include additional lending, borrowing, and LP positions, along with the ability to download data to CSV.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/203MLX5oj7fIPSsd3Vwb99/0984f0eed3ed853f4e766902ab3c9568/Lending.png\" alt=\"Lending\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2I0MJmlioJCAM2viLCe88c/eb061f725246fdb30ee51db8271fc137/MMI-Liquidity-Provision-clipped.png\" alt=\"MMI-Liquidity-Provision-clipped\"></p>\n<h2>Why it matters.</h2>\n<p>The MMI DeFi and Web3 dashboard improves the investor experience by integrating value-adding features and APIs into a single expanded dashboard. Once foundational features are built by the end of this quarter, investors will be able to seamlessly execute the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swap cryptocurrencies</li>\n<li>Lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision</li>\n<li>Buy, Manage, and Sell NFTs</li>\n<li>Stake tokens</li>\n<li>Bridge assets</li>\n<li>Run pre- and post-trade compliance</li>\n<li>Execute smart contracts</li>\n<li>Access yield and fixed income products</li>\n<li>Gather alpha from ConsenSys’ crypto economic research reports</li>\n<li>Obtain portfolio attribution</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We spent many hours with crypto funds over the last two quarters and found that spreadsheets were the most used portfolio management tool. We saw manual processes and hours spent entering data. On the reporting side, funds spend up to 10 hours each month trying to provide data that their fund admins can understand. The MMI dashboard was built to solve these user needs.</p>\n<p>Our focus is to build a truly institutional product and user experience. Incorporating these features into the MMI DeFi and web3 dashboard expands the utility of the dapp, and facilitates wider investor engagement across the ecosystem.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"UHovTghcbX4Qd3NkRNdu6","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Institutional DeFi Milestones: A 2021 Review","slug":"institutional-defi-milestones-a-2021-review","subtitle":"In 2021, many leading institutions took meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem with business model pivots and capital deployment.

They may not yet fully understand the drivers behind DeFi or Web3, but learned that the asset class cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>As a result, institutions dominated DeFi transactions in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform.

While the high yields offered an attractive opportunity for these banks, the regulatory and technology uncertainty involved kept them away from the ecosystem. 2021 changed that. Many investment banks–including Blackrock, BNYMellon, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-goldman-sachs-restarts-cryptocurrency-desk-amid-bitcoin-boom-2021-03-01/\">Goldman Sachs</a>–either revived their crypto desks, or entered the space.</p>\n<p>The year began with the news that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/01/20/blackrock-files-to-add-bitcoin-futures-to-funds/?sh=6f85db693086\">Blackrock had filed with the SEC</a> to add bitcoin exposure to two of its investment funds. The world’s largest asset manager also invested <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-invests-384m-bitcoin-mining-121211742.html\">$384M in bitcoin mining companies</a> last year, its regulatory filings showed. In a push towards greater acceptance of crypto as an investment, <a href=\"https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-release/bny-mellon-forms-new-digital-assets-unit-to-build-industrypercent27s-first-multi-asset-digital-platform-130169.html\">BNY Mellon</a>, the oldest bank in the US, formed a new digital assets unit, to provide services around bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html\">Goldman Sachs</a> decided to offer their wealth management clients access to bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank, the investment arm of the European Union, issued its <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/stories/cryptocurrency-blockchain-bonds\">first ever digital bond</a>, worth 100M euros, on public blockchain. Societe Generale, France’s third-largest bank, also proposed to <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/socgen-wants-to-borrow-20m-dai-on-makerdao-using-tokenized-bonds-as-collateral/\">borrow $20M in </a>Dai from MakerDAO, one of the largest DeFI protocols.</p>\n<h2>Retail Banks</h2>\n<p>From calling digital currencies a “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html\">fraud</a>”, to offering custodial services for their digital assets to clients, retail banks have come full circle in their relationship with digital currencies. In 2021, many retail banks either started offering bitcoin exposure, or considering such exposure for clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/04/26/jpmorgan-to-let-clients-invest-in-bitcoin-fund-for-first-time-sources/\">JPMorgan Chase</a> said in January that it may offer some clients the opportunity to invest in bitcoin funds. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-launches-digital-assets-unit-confirming-crypto-plans/602433/\">Citibank</a> launched a digital assets unit offering crypto investment services amid increasing interest from its clients.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan did not just stop at bitcoin funds. Later in the year, it partnered with <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/115087/wells-fargo-jpmorgan-partner-with-nydig-to-launch-bitcoin-funds\">Wells Fargo and NYDIG</a> to offer bitcoin exposure to their respective clients.

While institutions tested crypto waters, DeFi companies welcomed both venture capital, and human resources from the TradFi world.</p>\n<p>Crypto exchange <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104870/ftx-us-former-citadel-securities-brett-harrison-crypto-exchange\">FTX brought in Brett Harrison</a> as its first president. Harrison joined FTX from Citadel Securities, a leading global market maker. The company also <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/ftx-crypto-exchange-25-billion-valuation-74d4f9ee-073c-45fc-a888-ea05536d6f9d.html\">hit $25B in valuation</a>, when it raised $900M in July 2021.</p>\n<p>In another vote of trust for DeFi, crypto custodian Anchorage’s proposal to <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/54074/anchorage-first-federal-charter-digital-asset-bank\">become a digital bank</a> was approved by the US finance regulator in January 2021. Anchorage ended the year at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-350-million-at-3-billion-valuation/\">$3B valuation</a> after it raised $350M in December 2021.</p>\n<p>2021 was also a blockbuster year for ConsenSys. ConsenSys ended the year with a $3.2B valuation. The company’s famous crypto wallet, MetaMask, continued on its growth trajectory, reaching <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-21-million-maus-as-consensys-raises-200-million-to-make-web3-universally-easy-to-use-access-and-build-on/\">over 21M users</a> as of November 2021. <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">MetaMask Institutional partnered</a> with three leading custodians: BitGo, Qredo, and Cactus Custody to support institutional firms engaging with on-chain protocols.</p>\n<p>In another first for DeFi, Swiss digital bank Sygnum said it would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sygnum-becomes-first-bank-in-the-world-to-offer-eth2-staking\">allow its customers to stake their ETH</a> through its institutional banking platform. Crypto trading platform <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptocurrency-firm-bullish-go-public-9-bln-spac-deal-2021-07-09/\">Bullish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/08/usdc-stablecoin-backer-circle-to-go-public-in-45b-spac-deal/\">Circle</a> announced plans to go public via SPACs, while USDC-backer Circle also planned to become a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-plans-to-become-a-full-reserve-national-digital-currency-bank\">full-reserve digital bank</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Time for DeFi has Come</h2>\n<p>In 2021, many leading institutions shifted away from skepticism and took meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem with business model pivots and capital deployment.</p>\n<p>A whopping 90% of crypto’s largest deals happened in 2021, according to <a href=\"https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf\">a Messari report</a>. And this 90% did not even include Coinbase’s direct listing, which valued the crypto exchange at nearly $86B.</p>\n<p>These strides are strong indicators of the upwards journey of institutional interest in 2022. According to an Intertrust survey, hedge funds plan to hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f8044bf-8f0f-46b4-9fb7-6d0eba723017\">an average of 7% of their holdings</a> in cryptocurrencies by 2026. The long-term growth opportunity for DeFi can be gauged from the fact that the market cap of all DeFi protocols ($149B at the end of December 2021) is less than 1% of that of global banks—highlighting enormous room for growth.</p>\n<p>Organizations can embark on their journey into DeFi with MetaMask Institutional (MMI), a DeFi wallet and Web3 gateway built for institutions. MMI offers unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem, without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements. It enables crypto funds, market makers, and trading desks to trade, stake, borrow, lend, invest, and interact with over 17,000 DeFi protocols and applications.</p>\n<p><a

Jagdev","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Hello 2022! Today, MetaMask Institutional (MMI) launches custodian account multi-chain capabilities. This brings four important benefits to the crypto funds, trading desks, market makers, and other organizations working with MMI:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Custodial accounts on MMI, similar to those on the original MetaMask wallet, are now available across EVM networks. Hello sidechains and L2s!</li>\n<li>We’ve made it easier for our custodian and custody tech provider partners to roll out access to more EVM chains.</li>\n<li>As our custodian partners roll out more EVM chain support, users will automatically gain access to accounts on these chains.</li>\n<li>The above changes enable the bridging of assets across chains.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There it is: Web3 access and bridging across multiple EVM chains.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, this is only the beginning!</p>\n<p>Let’s dive in.</p>\n<h2>EVM Chain Support</h2>\n<p>MMI—like the original non-custodial MetaMask wallet—offers its users access to DeFi and Web3 across all EVM-compatible chains. MMI differs from the original MetaMask in that it is a custodial wallet. This means that custodians and custody technology providers facilitate key storage, key management, transaction signatures, and transaction broadcasting for MMI users, in line with institutional regulations.</p>\n<p>Given that it is the custodians who broadcast the transactions—the actual EVM chain access of MMI users is determined by the chains supported by their custodian. In practice for example, if a custodian only supports transactions on the Ethereum mainnet and Polygon network, then an MMI user would be limited to transacting across these two chains.</p>\n<p>Today MMI launched features that will support our custodian partners as they roll out more EVM chain access. This will give custodians the capabilities to add, sign, and broadcast any custom RPC url specified by the user—making the roll out of new EVM chain support much easier.</p>\n<h2>The Ability to Bridge Assets</h2>\n<p>The ability to bridge assets is a fundamental institutional need within DeFi. This entails performing a cross-chain swap by depositing an asset into a bridge contract in one chain, and then receiving minted assets on another chain. Bridging allows the ability to move assets to APY and unlocks yield farming opportunities across EVM chains.</p>\n<p>Based on the way many custodians are architected meant that MMI, historically, has connected one account to one network. This means that institutions would set up an account at a custodian and then have that account tied to a particular network, for example Mainnet or Polygon. This one to one relationship, although providing access, prevents the bridging of assets. In order for assets to be bridged, the address used to deposit tokens into the bridge contract must be the same in order to receive the minted tokens.</p>\n<p>Today MMI removes the connection between accounts and networks historically held by custodial accounts. This means that similar to MetaMask, custodial accounts on MMI will be available across multiple networks. As our custodian partners roll out more EVM-chain support, users will automatically have access to accounts on these chains, with no additional work required from either party—allowing for the bridging of assets across chains.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional’s focus has always been to provide unrivaled access to DeFi and Web3. We believe this latest feature launch takes us closer to that goal.</p>\n<p>Watch this space, because there’s more to come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\"><strong>Learn more about MetaMask Institutional</strong></a></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/ko/news/institutions/page/11/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/download/","/news/","/swaps/","/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/security/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":40,"categoryId":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","category":"institutions","totalItems":50,"currentPage":11,"totalPages":13,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"지원되지 않습니다.
