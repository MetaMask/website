whole”</strong> – Galina Ulanova</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GM.</p>\n<p>Volatility has been a unifying theme over the last several quarterly updates. I have reflected on volatile crypto markets, impacted by macroeconomics, geopolitics, monetary policy and market conditions. And while crypto markets were relatively robust throughout Q2, with bullish altcoin speculation in April and May, this quarter was the period of volatility in regulatory policy.</p>\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, I have also often reflected on our industry's optimism, mission-driven focus and second-to-none innovation cycles. It is also a cliche that bear markets are times to build. Hence, seeing the excitement, optimism and innovation across the ecosystem at EthCC a couple of weeks ago was not surprising. Q2 was a time for building for the ecosystem, and within MetaMask Institutional, it is and was no different.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Se tan bueno que no puedan ignorarte.\"</strong> — Cal Newport</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within MMI, our first principal focus is on providing unrivalled access across three core clients. The MMI Extension allows access to the long tail of permissionless innovation. Our Portfolio Dashboard offers a curated web3 experience, while Programmatic Access provides APIs for our users. However, we know institutional users have essential needs beyond transacting. Hence, we also focus on building experiences that empower organisations to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\"</strong> — Helen Keller</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A fantastic and exceptional partnership and announcement marked the year's second quarter. MetaMask Institutional and Fireblocks announced our joint integration. The integration brought together two prominent web3 powerhouses to provide the most complete enterprise-grade wallet security and portfolio management solution for institutional investors and builders. Over 1,800 organizations using Fireblocks will now be able to access MetaMask Institutional's (MMI) extensive suite of portfolio management solutions and leading DeFi connectivity to invest, trade, lend, and borrow on to 17,000+ dApps. For anyone wanting to learn more, please find the details [here.]\n(<a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/fireblocks/\">https://metamask.io/institutions/fireblocks/</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"The details are details. They make the product. The connections, the connections, the connections. It will in the end be these details that give the product its life.\"</strong> — Charles Eames</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within the Portfolio Dashboard, we dedicated the quarter to the foundations of the product. Looking across our architecture and APIs to dramatically improve and scale our experiences. This work lies below the surface and might not appear as a new and exciting feature. Yet, we have strict metrics and goals around the latency of our user experiences. It also means we have the highest standards for test coverage, monitoring and observability to ensure our APIs have the highest uptime. We prioritised this work in Q2 as it strengthens the foundations of our curated experience and will allow us to ship new features for our users much faster in the quarters ahead. In terms of new features, we added user management within the Portfolio Dashboard. Empowering administrators to add and delete users along with setting different user permissions. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/changelog/\">Please see our changelog</a> for updates on all the new features we ship.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3De0EAHXHhCqHEcXr6eZCw/09009f77f9abdc4f210f2571595bff48/e08959b6-f1d2-4484-b2fb-74553296cfcb.png\" alt=\"MMI Changelog\"></p>\n<p>Within our DeFi Services team, we offer detailed DeFi position views that entail valuations, claimed and unclaimed rewards details, profit, loss, and performance. We aim to provide DeFi valuation of any asset anywhere and offer an exceptional user experience with the lowest latency possible. In Q2, we expanded the range of DeFi protocols that we cover. While hardening our infrastructure. We have also conducted foundational work over the quarter and will launch a few exciting new features in Q3 of this year. Lastly, within our Web3 primitives team, we rolled out a series of improvements for our users. Namely, ensuring they always are given the lowest fee quoted by a Staking Service Provider within the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\">MMI Staking marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of growth, the number of signed organisations grew by 19.62% and the accounts they deployed by 13.70%. We are also seeing tremendously exciting growth in LATAM, with the region opening up crypto markets for users and organisations. Lastly, MMI achieved our SOC2 Type 1 certification in April. We are currently working towards SOC2 Type 2.</p>\n<p>We will ship important updates across all our core product experiences as we look ahead to the next quarter. Our users will be able to better monitor, manage, risk control, distribute and report on their web3 assets. Our focus is not only to give our users access to any asset anywhere but ensuring our product experiences are safe, secure, reliant and performant. Q3 will also be conference-heavy, with Token 2049 and Permissionless occurring during the same week in September. For any readers that will be in attendance, do come to our booths and planned events. We are in service to you and greatly appreciate the time we can spend to understand how we can build a better product for you.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,\nJohann Bornman</p>\n<p>@johannbornman\nProduct Lead</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5nGVmOqbohMmxrHMSAXhA3","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional Partners with Figment on Institutional Staking","slug":"metamask-institutional-partners-with-figment-on-institutional-staking","subtitle":"MetaMask Institutional (MMI) is thrilled to announce its partnership with Figment, a leader in staking infrastructure, and the largest non-custodial ETH staking provider.","image":{"title":"MMI-Figment-Partnership-Launch","description":"MMI Figment","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=webp 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/H2NWeURQ2gfPRlHjMkH6M/639f56faa51df485b03bb40934dc3020/Figment_joins_MetaMask_Institutional_Staking_Marketplace.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"July 20, 2023","authors":[{"name":"Johann Bornman and Simran Jagdev","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) is thrilled to announce its partnership with Figment, a leader in staking infrastructure, and the largest non-custodial ETH staking provider. This partnership will expand MMI’s institutional staking marketplace, which launched in March 2023.</p>\n<p>The addition of Figment to MMI’s staking marketplace brings MMI’s offering to five aggregated institutional staking providers, alongside Consensys Staking, and three others. With this decentralized approach, MMI offers institutions the choice among the industry's top tier providers, together with standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting, and a simplified staking experience. MMI’s institutional staking marketplace brings a unique and enhanced staking experience to all kinds of organizations seeking to engage in Web3.</p>\n<p>Before we dive deeper into the Figment-MMI partnership, let’s recap why staking is crucial for Ethereum, and how institutions stake.</p>\n<h2>Institutions and Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking was a core component of Ethereum’s move to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, away from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, in September last year.</p>\n<p>Staking entails depositing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toghrulmaharram/status/1530708903440302082\">32 ETH</a> to activate another validator, or node, to the network. These validators play a crucial role in achieving consensus by proposing new blocks, and verifying and attesting to the validity of other proposed blocks. As the number of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md\">honest validators</a> increases, the cost of attacking the network rises, significantly enhancing Ethereum's economic security.</p>\n<p>Ethereum’s upgrade to PoS brought numerous advantages, enhancing settlement <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#finality\">finality</a> guarantees, enabling <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/\">sharding</a>, and significantly reducing <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/\">ETH issuance</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/\">energy usage</a>. From the standpoint of an Ethereum user, this transition also opened up a fresh avenue for earning additional token rewards through <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#:~:text=Further%20reading-,What%20is%20staking%3F,new%20ETH%20in%20the%20process\">staking</a>.</p>\n<p>Staking can be an integral part of an institution’s digital asset strategy, especially since the Shanghai/Capella upgrade earlier this year. This upgrade enabled withdrawals of the ETH that had been locked on Ethereum’s consensus layer since December 2020, when staking was first enabled on the Beacon chain.</p>\n<p>However, the nuances and complexity of institutional staking can deter companies looking to participate. Choosing the right vendor for institutional staking can be complicated due to the differences in the fees charged, slashing coverage, infrastructure, terms and conditions,  and reporting standards. In addition, various staking providers offer different benefits to institutions, ranging from differences in infrastructure (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client) to certifications (SOC2 Type 2 and ISO 27001).</p>\n<p>Institutions often want to select their node locations too. This can help them comply with the regulations of the jurisdiction their nodes are in, and ensure the network is decentralized by choosing diverse node locations, among other things.</p>\n<p>MMI’s institutional staking marketplace is aimed at streamlining this complex staking experience for institutions and leveling the playing field by bringing together best-in-class partners to provide institutions with a simple one-click staking experience.</p>\n<h2>MMI Staking Marketplace</h2>\n<p>MMI’s staking marketplace provides access to top-tier staking providers; offers standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting; and a simplified staking experience—to facilitate broader institutional web3 participation.</p>\n<p>Institutions often require multiple custodial integrations to engage in web3, depending on their regulatory requirements, and security and privacy needs.

Organizations investing large sums of money often have different, stricter custody requirements than an individual investor investing their own money in decentralized finance (DeFi) and web3. For this reason, organizations need to evaluate their custody options carefully.</p>\n<p>In addition, different funds, trading desks, and other organizations have different operational and regulatory needs, and therefore require different custodian models.</p>\n<p>There are two ways that organizations can access custody solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third-party custodians</li>\n<li>Custody technology providers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this post, we will dive deep into these custody solutions, and explore how organizations can access all kinds of custody options with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> (MMI).</p>\n<h2>Understanding Crypto Custody</h2>\n<p>Before we look at the role of custody in web3, let’s understand custody in the context of traditional finance (TradFi). In TradFi, custodians, such as banks, keep assets safe from loss, theft, and unauthorized use; they facilitate settlement and clearing of transactions; comply with necessary regulations; and maintain a record of transactions and report them to investors.</p>\n<p>Similarly, custody in the institutional crypto world refers to the mechanisms in place to ensure the safety and security of an institution’s crypto assets. A third-party, also called a custodian, manages the institutional customer’s private keys, along with creating processes to approve and sign transactions. Custodians deploy various key management solutions including hardware security modules, multi-party computation, and multi-signature (multi-sig) to provide privacy, data integrity, identification and authentication.</p>\n<p>They also interact directly with broker/dealers and exchanges to facilitate transactions for fund managers. They are paramount to safely acquiring and holding crypto assets.</p>\n<p>A financial institution that wishes to engage with web3 needs a custodian to ensure that it is compliant with regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>MMI partners with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">12 custodians</a>, providing a choice of unparalleled institutional key management solutions to customers. In addition, MetaMask serves over 30M monthly active users and is connected to almost every web3 dapp. We thus offer unrivaled access to web3. We pair this ecosystem access with crucial features that organizations need to engage in the space– making MMI the best way for organizations to transact on-chain with institution-required security and operational efficiency.</p>\n<p>Now let’s look at some pros and cons for organizations using a custodian to access web3.</p>\n<h3>Pros of Crypto Custody</h3>\n<h4>Security and Risk Mitigation</h4>\n<p>Storing crypto carries the risk of losing one’s private keys and in turn, losing access to all digital assets. For this reason, organizations trust custodians to safely store their private keys so that they don’t bear the risks of self-storage.</p>\n<p>Custodians also often provide insurance against third-party hacks, theft of private keys, and other such risky scenarios. This provides an additional layer of safety to institutional investors. Most times it is also a regulatory requirement for organizations to use a custodian when interacting with web3.</p>\n<h4>Expertise and Enhanced Support Services</h4>\n<p>Apart from securing a customer’s digital assets, custodians provide knowledge on other services that organizations can tap into to expand their web3 understanding. For example, custodians can offer brokerage services to organizations.</p>\n<p>Custodians also have extensive knowledge of asset custody that can help organizations navigate complex custody requirements and industry best practices.</p>\n<h4>Regulatory Compliance</h4>\n<p>Licensed custodians offer regulatory compliance to institutional investors. They are regularly audited and are required to comply with know-your-customer/ anti-money laundering (KYC/ AML) procedures, and other compliance measures based on their jurisdiction. They are allowed to hold digital assets on behalf of a customer, much like a bank. An example of a licensed custodian is BitGo, which is also an MMI partner.</p>\n<h3>Cons of Crypto Custody</h3>\n<h4>High Costs</h4>\n<p>Engaging a custodian means paying a fee, along with account maintenance and asset storage costs. These fees can be expensive, and may eventually not justify the returns on investment, especially for smaller institutional investors or those with limited resources.</p>\n<h4>Limited Control over Assets</h4>\n<p>By allowing a custodian to control their digital assets and transactions, organizations can relinquish some decision-making authority. Many times, custodians have to set governance standards and approval policies for the custodian in order to comply with regulations. The custodian holds an investor’s assets, therefore, the investor may not be able to respond to lucrative market situations quickly enough to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>Since a custodian holds the investor’s private keys, they become a single point of failure. Any disruptions or failures on the part of the custodian can negatively impact the organization's investments and assets.</p>\n<h4>Limited Asset Choices</h4>\n<p>Custodians may only provide support for certain digital assets to institutional investors. This can be a challenging situation for investors as it can lead to lack of diversity in their web3 portfolio. It can also limit them from exploring alternative assets such as tokens linked to emerging blockchain technology and prohibit investors from gaining access to the latest on-chain market opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Rise of Self-Custody</h2>\n<p>Due to the strict regulatory requirements that institutional investors need to comply with, self-custody is often a tricky option. This is where custody tech providers come in. They help create the technology for custodial services that can be managed by the customer themselves. In this case, the private keys are managed by an organization themselves.</p>\n<p>The implosion of FTX, one of the largest centralized exchanges in web3, and the subsequent liquidity crisis at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank have brought the idea of self-custody into much sharper focus. These instances underlined the age-old crypto adage of “not your keys, not your crypto”.</p>\n<p>The collapse of SVB drove nearly <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-control-from-traditional-web3-custody-rita-martins/?trk=public_post_main-feed-card_feed-article-content\">$70K worth of Bitcoin into self-custody wallets</a>. While this is an expected outcome of extreme market volatility, the one trend that stood out in the recent market exodus was that the charge was led by institutional money, according to <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/personal-wallets-institutional-crypto-adoption-self-custody-defi/\">a Chainalysis report</a>.</p>\n<p>A custody tech provider gives the nuts and bolts, i.e the security infrastructure, technology to set up own governance rules, and different custody options to organizations to build their own custody solutions. Unlike custodians, custody tech providers do not have permission to execute transactions on behalf of an institution, or have access or control over their digital assets.</p>\n<p>Users of MMI can access self-custody options through <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/consensys-and-gnosis-safe-partner-to-introduce-self-custodial-digital-asset-solutions-for-enterprises-looking-for-web3-adoption/\">Safe</a>, a leading on-chain multi-sig contract wallet provider and digital asset management platform, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">Qredo</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">GK8</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-and-fireblocks-integrate-to-offer-unrivaled-defi-and-web3-access/\">Fireblocks</a>, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">Parfin</a>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s explore the pros and cons of self-custody for institutional investors.</p>\n<h3>Pros of Self-Custody</h3>\n<h4>Enhanced Control</h4>\n<p>Self-custody gives institutional investors direct control over their crypto assets, and includes managing their private keys. By directly interacting with blockchain networks, investors can reduce the risk of third-party interference and unauthorized access. This allows institutions to create their own security processes and use cold storage solutions for increased security.</p>\n<p>Direct control over their digital assets also allows institutions to interact with their choice of decentralized applications and DeFi protocols supported by the custody tech provider, without relying on intermediaries.</p>\n<h4>Improved Privacy</h4>\n<p>Having control over their private keys and transactions with self-custody ensures that institutional investors have greater privacy and confidentiality. Since investors have direct control over their transactions, they do not need to disclose their transactions and holdings to third-parties, thereby reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information about their investments.</p>\n<h4>Access to Diverse Assets</h4>\n<p>As we read above, custodians are often unable to provide access to a wide range of digital assets in web3 due to the strict regulatory requirements they have to comply with. These assets may include various cryptocurrencies, tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). By choosing to self-custody their assets, institutional investors can take an independent call on the kinds of digital assets they want to invest in, depending on their investment objectives.</p>\n<h3>Cons of Self-Custody</h3>\n<h4>Security Risks</h4>\n<p>Institutional investors have full responsibility for the security of their private keys and digital assets when they choose self-custody. Any lapses in security or mishandling of private keys can have dire consequences, including permanent loss of their digital assets. Self-custody often does not provide backup services and the complexity of setting up robust security mechanisms to ensure protection against phishing attacks and theft can be challenging for institutions new to web3.</p>\n<h4>Lack of Institutional Infrastructure</h4>\n<p>Self-custody may not be a feasible option for all institutional investors. Without the expertise of a custodian, institutions may find it challenging to meet regulatory obligations, internal governance requirements, and shareholder expectations about investment returns.</p>\n<p>In addition, establishing the necessary security infrastructure for safely storing digital assets, creating auditing mechanisms and other compliance procedures can lead to operational complexities and may be resource intensive.</p>\n<h4>Regulatory Challenges</h4>\n<p>Self-custody for institutions in web3 is still in its nascent stage, and it operates in a regulatory landscape that is rapidly evolving. Institutional investors need to ensure that they comply with the regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions, especially those that deal with KYC/ AML. In such cases, choosing self-custody can increase the burden of compliance on institutions and can also lead to potential risk of non-compliance.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>As we have seen above, each of the two approaches to custody of digital assets for institutional investors have their benefits and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>While some organizations may want to take advantage of increased control over their assets with self-custody, others may want to work with a custodian that can provide them enhanced features such as staking and lending.</p>\n<p>As such, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach that can work for all institutions. This is why MMI offers the widest range of top-tier custody and self-custody solutions to institutional investors. MMI is the only multi-custodial institutional web3 wallet, and its custody options aim to meet all variations of institutional-grade custody requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MMI</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2AIRt8MBePwdwcrsG8sR7r","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional Launches a More Powerful Web3 Portfolio Dashboard for Organizations","slug":"metamask-institutional-launches-a-more-powerful-web3-portfolio-dashboard-for","subtitle":"MMI’s upgraded portfolio dashboard offers a range of cutting-edge tools—including portfolio management, digital asset monitoring, in-depth transaction reporting, and institutional controls.","image":{"title":"MMIPD","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=128&h=72&q=80&fm=webp 128w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=128&h=72&q=80&fm=png 128w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4lZV8V9UcJ9t75w15nJ3D7/1f75c94f6534d3fbb8f77b65c82a0cc1/MMIPD.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"March 23, 2023","authors":[{"name":"Johann Bornman","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we seek to drastically improve how organizations access and engage with web3.

This allows organizations to take advantage of optimal gas prices, and transact with some of the lowest failure rates.</p>\n<p>MMI’s swap feature provides users with a simplified experience, enabling them to swap any ERC-20 token across multiple DEXs. This feature was previously only accessible through the MMI browser extension.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2iu3OwffKc\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Stake ETH</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most significant upgrade within the MMI portfolio dashboard is the launch of the first institutional ETH staking marketplace. Previously, choosing the right staking service provider could be challenging for organizations due to the complexities between different providers’ infrastructure configurations (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client), certifications, reporting standards, fee structures, and terms and conditions (T&#x26;C).</p>\n<p>MMI addresses this complexity by simplifying vendor selection and streamlining access to four top-tier institutional staking providers with standardized T&#x26;Cs, comprehensive reporting templates, and a significantly simplified staking experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/632mmsR7BJgfZO8cIolYlV/36cc36dbc0d8f3e7e0243f7c659e5ae9/Staking-marketing-screen.png\" alt=\"Staking-marketing-screen\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-launches-the-first-marketplace-for-institutional-staking-on-metamask-institutional-in-partnership-with-allnodes-blockdaemon-and-kiln\">Read the press release</a></strong></p>\n<p>Today, organizations can choose to stake their ETH with Allnodes, Blockdaemon, Consensys, and Kiln from within the MMI portfolio dashboard, and earn rewards for securing the Ethereum blockchain.

We also determine the claimed and unclaimed rewards of the positions. This allows organizations to understand the value of their DeFi positions, including the profit or loss and performance of their positions at all times.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3kT4g33ZcjARN94P0w7iXS/9ef5c79191822606582008d288ea3fb6/bwzcky6fhRg7WQ-Xiep4YcryohZr2U6PMEX7dkEcbs36eBlIMQUnrrXaXrq3gT7w0ggVSR17dw8dlbuS4bQMH3YmpioJzn2o6lDitGbHJon_vNruoFhuYUvBA29Z.png\" alt=\"bwzcky6fhRg7WQ-Xiep4YcryohZr2U6PMEX7dkEcbs36eBlIMQUnrrXaXrq3gT7w0ggVSR17dw8dlbuS4bQMH3YmpioJzn2o6lDitGbHJon vNruoFhuYUvBA29ZiqcC\"></p>\n<h2>Track NFTs</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows users to view detailed metrics for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) held across different custodians, wallets, accounts, and marketplaces. It provides organizations with improved capability around their NFT holdings, with metrics including average sale price, aggregate floor price data from different marketplaces, price estimates, collection price history, historical price charts, rarity rank, and traits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/CgcXcxcreKbra3kVuUlBq/bc52db0e1dc596a2efb2489643144621/MDaNFV2R75l1rH2L3KyMBudtwR-1AWkikv4yCsVOzFSnyg0n7ORN8O_-zZcvGc4zncLpaV7mtpH1duYnZQ4crQ14gxB9O5LeHvPs40755U6rJmsvM6gyVjUEqHZd.png\" alt=\"MDaNFV2R75l1rH2L3KyMBudtwR-1AWkikv4yCsVOzFSnyg0n7ORN8O -zZcvGc4zncLpaV7mtpH1duYnZQ4crQ14gxB9O5LeHvPs40755U6rJmsvM6gyVjUEqHZdRECX\"></p>\n<h2>Bundle Accounts</h2>\n<p>The dashboard enables organizations to group accounts into portfolio bundles across their team or organization. The MMI dashboard and browser extension allows users to have up to 100 accounts. By bundling these accounts, they can better manage and monitor account and portfolio activity</p>\n<h2>Manage Assets with a Web3 Focus</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows organizations to monitor their web3 assets across all EVM chains. They can see a breakdown of their organization’s portfolio, including digital asset holdings, sector allocation, protocol allocation, performance, and historical transactions.
