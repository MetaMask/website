their environment. They are quick learners who adapt well through observation, play, and trial and error. As a web3 dabbler, I can find a lot in common with them.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of curiosity and learning, many teams within ConsenSys gathered together to bring <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> to life. It’s been a labor of love, and one we hope inspires the curious fox in all who come across it. We’re excited to finally share it with you today.</p>\n<h3>What is MetaMask Learn?</h3>\n<br />\n<p>MetaMask Learn is a free-to-use educational platform available in 10 languages for anyone interested in learning about web3. Through engaging lessons and interactive simulations, it helps you understand what web3 is, why it matters, and how to get started.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is for you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve been interested in web3 but just don’t know where to start</li>\n<li>You’ve bought some crypto on an exchange but don’t know what to do with it</li>\n<li>You still don’t understand web3 principles because they’ve been too jargon-heavy</li>\n<li>You want to know what the fuss about web3 really is</li>\n<li>You just want to keep up with your friends who babble about this new digital era and its possibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list could go on. But at its core, Learn is designed for anyone who wants to take the leap to explore uncharted waters. At a self-moderated pace, you can jump into any and all lessons that interest you, interact with features in the simulation, and experience those satisfying “ah-ha” moments when you finally grasp important concepts. As you may have heard, crypto wasn’t created to make you rich, it was created to set you free. And we like to think freedom is fun.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Learn syllabus will guide you through 8 initial topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-web3?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is Web3?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-crypto-wallet?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is a Crypto Wallet?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-era-of-digital-identity?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">The Era of Digital Identity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-self-custody-wallet?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is Self-Custody?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-advent-of-digital-ownership?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">The Advent of Digital Ownership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">NFTs and Creators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/finance-decentralized?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">Finance, Decentralized</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-age-of-communities?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">Age of Communities</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 10 languages: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Tagalog (Philippines), Bahasa\n(Indonesia), Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish.

As the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, we’ve seen a lot and recognize the steep learning curve when it comes to learning web3 concepts for the first time.</p>\n<p>In Gemini’s 2022 Global State of Crypto <a href=\"https://www.gemini.com/gemini-2022-state-of-crypto-global.pdf\">survey</a>, respondents were nearly twice as likely to say that more educational resources would help them get started with crypto (40%), compared to recommendations from friends (22%).</p>\n<p>If you’ve been looking for a place to send your family and friends to the next time you’re sharing your enthusiasm for web3, have <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> up your sleeve!</p>\n<p>In addition to helping educate more people in the space, we want to help combat scammers who prey on unsuspecting victims by equipping you with the fundamental knowledge to understand self-custody and true ownership.</p>\n<p>If you feel more confident in navigating the web3 waters after MetaMask Learn, we did our job. Pssst, never ever ever share your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) with anyone. Or click on weird links. <em>Just had to get that out there.</em></p>\n<h3>It Takes A Village</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Encompassing moments of delight throughout the experience, we want to thank our partner in this project, <a href=\"https://www.stinkstudios.com/\">Stink Studios</a> for bringing MetaMask Learn to life.</p>\n<p>The amount of successful scamming and phishing attempts reduce significantly when we equip people with knowledge.</p>\n<p>We collaborated with great organizations in the space that will all use MetaMask Learn as one of their go-to web3 onboarding guides.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6csGV1uy43SKECcotf0TjB/13b66ddd871677c0618a180f3e1e6741/MM_Learn_Partners_Feb_2023_Final.png\" alt=\"MM Learn Partners Feb 2023 Final\"></p>\n<p>From celebrating diverse communities and encouraging inclusivity with <em>Women of Web3, Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow, Crypto Tech Women, Women in Tech, the Ukraine Government, and Giving Block</em>…</p>\n<p>To welcoming the next wave of creators, artists, and gamers in the world of NFTs with <em>Animoca, Unity, and Sandbox</em>…</p>\n<p>And overall building more awareness around self-custody with <em>ENS, Moonpay, Transak, Sardine</em>…</p>\n<p>Thank you for the work that you do.</p>\n<p>To the dapp developer, NFT creator, and DAO steward reading this, <strong>add this to your onboarding guide</strong> for a frictionless experience for your new users.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is there to inspire you to learn about the new world we’re in. It’s not enough to just stay on the sidelines and only take notice when crypto exchange billionaires steal user funds, <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">you should know exactly where to go to learn more about web3</a>.</p>\n<p>And even if you’re a self-proclaimed expert in web3, I’m sure you know someone who would benefit from this—a friend, a family member, that random person on the sidewalk passing you by proclaiming how much they don’t understand “that crypto stuff.” Maybe now they will.</p>\n<h3>Stay Curious</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We hope you enjoy MetaMask Learn as it pops its head out of its den to say hello to the world.

You can stake and view your rewards directly in the dapp without having to leave.</p>\n<h3>What is Staking?</h3>\n<p>In the context of Ethereum, staking is the act of securing the network by “depositing” or “locking up” your tokens into a smart contract and receiving rewards in return. This is typically done in 3 ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liquid staking</li>\n<li>Solo staking</li>\n<li>Custodial staking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MetaMask Staking allows you to engage in liquid staking with two prominent providers, Lido and Rocket Pool, whereby you can deposit your ETH and receive a token representing the value of your stake in return. While the end result of liquidity staking is basically the same, how it works (the token issued in exchange for staking your assets) differs across providers.</p>\n<p>Lido issues stETH in exchange for ETH; Rocket Pool issues rETH in exchange for ETH.</p>\n<p>Lido’s stETH is a rebasing token that accrues rewards by increasing the amount of stETH owned over time; Rocket Pool’s rETH is a repricing token that accrues rewards by increasing the amount of ETH that rETH is redeemable for.</p>\n<p>Users either choose to hold on to this stETH/rETH token for when they would like to withdraw their stake (not currently available until future network upgrades), use it as collateral in DeFi, or even <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">swap</a> it for another token (back to ETH or another ERC20).</p>\n<p>Note: <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake\">MetaMask Staking</a> provides the interface to connect with Lido and Rocket Pool smart contracts directly—we don’t provide the staking service ourselves.</p>\n<h3>How to Stake</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit portfolio.metamask.io</li>\n<li>Toggle to the staking tab to choose your desired staking provider and click \"Stake\"</li>\n<li>Enter the amount you want to stake and click \"Review\"</li>\n<li>Review your stake and click \"Confirm\"</li>\n<li>Sign the transaction in your wallet</li>\n<li>When your transaction is complete, click \"View holdings\"</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Securing the network and receiving rewards</h3>\n<p>In this post-Merge world, there is a growing demand for simple staking services that will ultimately secure Ethereum.

Since Ethereum’s Merge, it has also become one of the technical underpinnings of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In this deep dive, we’ll walk you through different areas where token lockups have become fundamental to web3: DeFi, user flows in dapps, DAOs, and, most importantly, <strong>protocol staking</strong>: securing an entire network.</p>\n<h4>Jump to:</h4>\n<p>__</p>\n<h5>- <a href=\"#staking-in-defi-yield-bearing-tokens\">Staking in DeFi: Yield-bearing tokens</a></h5>\n<h5>- <a href=\"#token-lockups-in-business-and-philanthropy\">Token lockups in Business and Philanthropy</a></h5>\n<h5>- <a href=\"#staking-in-daos-membership-participation-and-governance\">Staking in DAOs: Membership, Participation, and Governance</a></h5>\n<h5>- <a href=\"#staking-as-a-network-level-security-protocol\">Staking as a Network-Level Security Protocol</a></h5>\n<p>__\n<br></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#staking-a-definition\">Staking: A definition</a></h2>\n<p>‘Staking’ proper should be thought of as what happens at the network protocol level, as in Ethereum’s Proof of Stake. A deeper explanation of this is below, but simply put, <strong>users ‘lock up’ some amount of crypto assets by depositing them into a smart contract</strong> (a public computer program that runs on a blockchain network); <strong>most commonly, the user will expect to receive some sort of privileges or rewards over time in exchange for their stake</strong>, and can withdraw their tokens as and when they wish.</p>\n<p>This pattern of locking up tokens in exchange for access, privileges, or rewards occurs in a lot of ways across the ecosystem, and it’s confusing to call them all ‘staking’. Often, when you see a reference to ‘staking tokens’, it might be more accurate to just say ‘locking up’, or ‘depositing’.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ewdTYbyzephIqX7GxBF9z/d84bf257ef76d2654a4edb130fc22669/Staking_in_Defi.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Staking in Defi\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#staking-in-defi-yield-bearing-tokens\">Staking in DeFi: Yield-bearing tokens</a></h2>\n<p>Getting oriented in the world of Decentralized Finance can be challenging, especially if you’re not someone who has a formal education or interest in finance. Remember, money is one thing; it’s the medium of exchange. Finance is entirely another, and has to do with the ways that money within markets interacts, often on a very large scale. Decentralized Finance takes traditional financial markets and tools and makes them accessible for use with blockchain tokens.</p>\n<p>One of the great innovations that DeFi has brought has been automations in access to liquidity. These automations have had huge changes at the level of the individual, trying to get a loan or trade one asset for another, as well as on a macro-level, solving the problem of how we coordinate these asset exchanges across an entire economy.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#liquidity-pools\">Liquidity Pools</a></h3>\n<p>In today’s financial world, a brokerage or financial institution will use software to manage orders to buy and sell; DeFi takes that power out of the hands of private companies, and instead provides public trading interfaces anyone can use. These smart contracts and protocols allow users to trade one token for another by balancing the value between two linked 'pools' of those tokens, known collectively as a <em>liquidity pool</em> (or 'LP,' for short).</p>\n<p>This first step is called <em>providing liquidity</em>. Most DeFi protocols will give liquidity providers a token in return for their deposit: an 'LP token'. This token, which in the case of Uniswap’s v3 protocol is an NFT with fancy graphics, serves like a receipt or a ticket at a coat check: the holder can prove they deposited those funds, and they can use that token to withdraw them.</p>\n<p>On some platforms, the LP doesn’t receive one single token; rather, they get some amount of 'platform-native tokens' corresponding to the value deposited in the pool(s). The benefit of this model is providing the user with liquidity while their other tokens are locked up, a pattern we’ll see again.</p>\n<p>Not content with that level of complexity, DeFi took this a step further by asking: <em>what if you could lock up your LP tokens, too?</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#staking-yields-and-farming\">Staking, Yields, and Farming</a></h3>\n<p>This meta-level, where you’re locking up LP tokens or platform-native tokens, rather than contributing to a multi-token pool, is called <strong>staking</strong> on most DeFi protocols. (Even SushiSwap, which has Japanese food-branded naming schemes for everything, labels this part of the flow ‘staking’ in the actual UI.) Most often, through staking LP tokens or the protocol’s native tokens, users are offered the ability to accrue some sort of ‘reward token’, the value of which is highly variable from platform to platform.</p>\n<p>The rewards collected by those participating in staking are often called 'yields', and the activity of participating in this system with the intention of reaping yields from staking is known as 'yield farming'. The wordplay, puns, and metaphors arising from this are many, and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/31/yearn-yam-and-the-rise-of-cryptos-weird-defi-moment/\">border on the nonsensical</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6aLJBFutr3U5R6cesS26cN/97048ea143a4d0970d103e456e902c1c/Staking_as_a_UX_flow.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Staking_as_a_UX_flow\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#token-lockups-in-business-and-philanthropy\">Token lockups in Business and Philanthropy</a></h2>\n<p>The flow outlined above has been baked into most DeFi token trading platforms, but is by no means limited to that use case. As more projects develop that use tokenization for monetary aspects of their operations, you will begin to see this pattern implemented more and more:</p>\n<p><strong>Initial interaction > Receive token > lock up token > receive platform rewards</strong></p>\n<h5>There are already plenty of rewards programs in the world; imagine if you could lock up <a href=\"https://flycoin.org/\">your airline miles</a> and earn extra, or instead of a punch-hole card at <a href=\"https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2022/starbucks-brewing-revolutionary-web3-experience-for-its-starbucks-rewards-members/\">your local coffee place</a>, you lock up rewards tokens to get bags of coffee or a nice mug.</h5>\n<p><br>\nAnother sub-field that has existed for some time in traditional finance and economic development is that of microloans. Web2 supercharged this model, whose spiritual predecessors include the world’s many traditional circular lending systems, and opened the door to massive numbers of contributors and recipients.</p>\n<p>The transparency, as well as the built-in set of financial tools, offered by blockchain technology represent the potential for another huge technological leap for microloan and direct-financing organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://giveth.io/\">GivETH</a> is an organization (and a DAO–see below) that fairly closely resembles a traditional Web2 microloans platform, allowing direct investment in projects, but with the added traceability and transparency offered by conducting these transactions on-chain. In addition, their <a href=\"https://giveth.io/giveconomy\">platform has a native token</a>, which holders can stake, receive rewards, and increase the liquidity flows throughout the entire system.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ethichub.com/en/\">EthicHub</a> could be described as a microloans platform, but it might be more useful to think of it as a direct investment entity, specifically providing loans to subsistence coffee farmers who cannot access capital through traditional finance. Without that capital, they are unable to improve their infrastructure or, in some cases, simply get their product to market. EthicHub, too, has found it convenient to create a dual funding system, allowing both fiat contributions as well as participation through DeFi, featuring a native token and staking structure.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://doingud.com/\">DoinGud</a> is still growing as a project, but is notable in its innovative usage of NFTs: the platform is an art gallery, a publication platform, and an NFT sales platform all in one, with part of their proceeds going to specific, established social causes in need of funding. While their tokenomics plan has yet to be fully released, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qstbnHfvbb5NjpqaOG3B7KtFwLRk_KyN/view\">their roadmap includes staking tokens in order to participate in governance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, we’ve clearly outlined ways that locking up tokens can be used in financial applications, but locking up tokens so that you can <em>vote</em>? We’ll explore this topic in the next section.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/riVkLZDitAJSm3f7aU0S2/23295ce6e12ba681bd49c0e60b1fb0c6/Staking_in_DAOs.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Staking in DAOs\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#staking-in-daos-membership-participation-and-governance\">Staking in DAOs: Membership, Participation, and Governance</a></h2>\n<p>One of the use cases that token lockups have already found is in DAOs, and DAO governance. This is a whole topic in and of itself, but here are some high-level concepts so you get the idea.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"#what%E2%80%99s-a-dao-\">What’s a DAO?</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DAO stands for <strong><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/\">Decentralized Autonomous Organization</a></strong>. One way to think of it is: if a public blockchain network is the decentralized equivalent of a public database, a DAO would be the decentralized equivalent of a club, or an NGO, or maybe even a company, or partnership.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"#what-does-a-dao-do-\">What does a DAO do?</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DAOs, as a concept and a functioning model, are still very much in their early days, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/solutions/daos-and-web3-governance/\">people are figuring out how to make them work well</a>, what they work well for, and how they may–or may not–fit into existing legal definitions of groups and societies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"#how-does-a-dao-work-and-what-does-this-have-to-do-with-staking-\">How does a DAO work, and what does this have to do with staking?</a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This topic is known as <strong>DAO Governance</strong>, and is subject to a lot of conversation, investigation, and debate. Many DAOs use some sort of voting system to allow its members to collectively make decisions. (In fact, one well-known DAO, <a href=\"https://aragon.org/\">Aragon</a>, specializes in developing tools to support other DAOs in these functions.)\n<ul>\n<li>This couples well with the technology of public blockchains, as the protocols by which the votes are taken and counted, as well as <strong>the results of those votes, are all completely public and available to be observed and audited</strong>; no closed doors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Often, DAOs will issue what is known as 'governance tokens,' which will allow the holder to participate in voting (like <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qstbnHfvbb5NjpqaOG3B7KtFwLRk_KyN/view\">the example of DoinGud</a>, above). There can be different ways to acquire those tokens, and in fact, in the initial DeFi scenario explained above, often those 'platform-native' tokens that one receives through a DeFi platform are also governance tokens.</li>\n<li>Another pattern often seen is that the platform’s tokens can be used as fungible assets, like any other cryptocurrency; this is the case with <a href=\"https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/\">ENS</a>. Some DAOs allow these fungible tokens to then be locked up, at which point they become governance tokens–or the user is issued governance tokens in exchange for their stake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are a couple of common ways–and by no means is this an exhaustive list–that DAOs employ ‘staking’. Another issue entirely is the question: <em>when is a network… a DAO?</em></p>\n<p>This comparison between networks and DAOs is often made as a joke, but it’s an interesting question of definitions. In the next section, we take a look at some of the ways that a network and a DAO may be, in fact, quite similar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/ApUEB48dVXrCYgckSVp44/dd222d7000381c552ed018f205530d0f/Staking_as_a_Network-Level_Security_Protocol.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"Staking as a Network-Level Security Protocol\"></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#staking-as-a-network-level-security-protocol\">Staking as a Network-Level Security Protocol</a></h2>\n<p>We’ll come back to our philosophical considerations in a moment. First, let’s provide some technical context to understand staking at the network level.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#background-blockchain-consensus-mechanisms\">Background: Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms</a></h3>\n<p>With over 456,000 validators staking 32 ETH each–more than $22 billion at today's rates–Ethereum's Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism is the biggest example of staking in the blockchain ecosystem. Unlike the governance and financial applications we’ve seen so far, this staking mechanism provides an additional function: <em>securing the entire network</em>. There are a number of networks that do this, such as <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-pos\">Polygon</a> or <a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/technology/pure-proof-of-stake\">Algorand</a>, but let’s take a look at Ethereum’s, which serves as a blueprint for so much in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p>The ten-second version: When Ethereum was launched, it was a worldwide network of people who were all running software on their computers (known as <em>nodes</em>) that synced the data of a shared database–a <em>distributed ledger.</em> These nodes would reach <em>consensus</em> about what the current state of that database was. The main challenge to this project was security: how do you prevent a bad actor from gaining control over the database and changing it to suit themselves?</p>\n<p>Ethereum took a cue from Bitcoin before it, which had solved this problem through a security system known as <em>Proof of Work</em>(PoW). What’s PoW? To greatly simplify it, you couldn’t modify the ledger without solving a really, really difficult math problem, and the more computational power that was added to the network, the harder the math problem got–-so you couldn’t beat this by “brute forcing” it. This security system, effective as it is, creates an “arms race” of buying better and better and faster computers, in order to have the most power, to have the most likelihood of solving the math problem and getting a reward, in cryptocurrency. This inefficiency also has a direct correlative effect on the amount of electricity the network uses (<em>a lot</em>).</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#staking-on-ethereum-how-it-works\">Staking on Ethereum: How it works</a></h3>\n<p>From fairly early on, the Ethereum community realized that they needed another <em>consensus mechanism</em>. The solution that was arrived upon is called <strong>Proof of Stake</strong>. Again, to put it simply: those who wish to participate in confirming blockchain data across the network must first stake 32 ether into a specific smart contract. These tokens are held as a guarantee that they will run their node in compliance with the network’s requirements. If their node goes offline for too long, or if it behaves in a manner that appears to be prejudicial or in bad faith to the network’s operations, then the node operator’s stake can be <em>slashed</em>, in other words, burned and taken from them, in whole or in part. They lose their stake, and they lose the ability to operate a node and keep bringing in ETH.</p>\n<p>And 32 ether is no small thing to lose.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#staking-on-ethereum-how-to-do-it\">Staking on Ethereum: How to do it</a></h3>\n<h4><a href=\"#solo-staking\">Solo Staking</a></h4>\n<p>Any set of instructions on this topic will always be incomplete, with the speed with which new protocols and platforms are being built on top of the functionality of Ethereum’s staking system. That said, the official instructions and method for self-hosting a node are somewhat fixed, <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/\">and can be consulted here</a>. For a more entertaining and detailed look at what it’s actually like to set up and run your own node, check out <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/\">Coogan’s story here</a>.</p>\n<p>But if you don’t have the 32 ETH to put up for a full node (and most of us don’t), there are a number of ways to participate and stake smaller amounts of ETH. Let’s take a look at two popular solutions.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"#liquid-staking\">Liquid Staking</a></h4>\n<p>Network staking is a pretty clever security system, but it has its drawbacks. There are three big problems that are addressed through the clever mechanism of <em>liquid staking</em>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Minimum deposit:</strong> As already mentioned, what if you want to stake but don’t have 32 ETH?</li>\n<li><strong>Locked assets</strong>: If you stake your ETH in the network, you can’t use it for anything else.</li>\n<li><strong>Coordinating pools</strong> of small-scale stakers into groups of 32 ETH <strong>while allowing them to pull out</strong> of the stake when desired</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The way liquid staking works is this: Let’s say Rana has 3.5 ETH that she wants to stake. She deposits her ETH into the liquid staking platform of her choosing. As others do the same, the protocol or staking platform bundles up 32 ETH at a time, deposits it to the Ethereum staking address, and spins up a node. <strong>Thus,</strong> <strong>our first problem is solved: Rana is now participating in staking</strong>, and will receive, proportionally, the rewards that correspond to her based on the amount of ETH she deposited.</p>\n<h5>There is an additional feature enabled at this point, often touted by liquid staking proponents: now that Rana has her ETH locked up, accumulating rewards, she can take the liquidity that she was given in the form of her staking tokens, and do something else with it, like staking it in an additional DeFi protocol that allows her to reap even more rewards.</h5>\n<p><br>\nBut how does Rana get the rewards from the staked ETH? Well, when she deposited her 3.5 ETH, she got something in return: just like with our DeFi example above, she got a sort of LP token, which links her to her stake and the returns she’s owed. How the token works differs from one liquid staking solution to another, but Rana is given an <strong>equivalent value in those tokens to the amount of ETH she staked</strong>; in other words, <strong>she still has the liquidity of her ETH</strong>, even though it’s been staked. <strong>Thus, our second problem has been solved.</strong></p>\n<p>Lastly, <strong>how do you coordinate all this?</strong> While it can sound like a lot to keep track of, this is where smart contract technology does a lot of the heavy lifting. Projects that provide liquid staking have a series of smart contracts that manage the different parts of the operation: taking the users’ deposits, providing them with their corresponding liquid staking token, managing the issuance and balance of those tokens, etc. Other parts of the operation, relating to ‘how the project is run’, can be run through a DAO, thus increasing visibility and credibility into what is, essentially, a shared resource.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait… What about when someone wants to pull out their ETH?</strong></p>\n<p>Liquid staking providers don’t currently offer this functionality, <strong>because they can’t</strong>. When the Ethereum network made the switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, they focused on getting Proof of Stake running properly <em>first</em>, before moving on to the process by which users could withdraw already-staked ETH. For now, all staked ETH remains staked.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal functionality is scheduled to be released in <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/450\">the Shanghai upgrade</a>, which could happen during 2023. In the meantime, users wishing to get rid of their liquid staking tokens and “change them back” to ETH would have to do so through a swap, which they can do right from their MetaMask wallet by clicking or tapping the “Swap” button.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"#custodial-staking\">Custodial Staking</a></h4>\n<p>For some users, liquid staking seems the obvious choice: they want the flexibility of staking the amount they want, when they want to, and still having the liquidity of their ETH to engage in other DeFi activities.</p>\n<p>Another option, though, and the more appealing one for some users, is what’s known as <em>custodial staking</em>. Like it sounds, under this system, someone else is holding your ETH and staking it on your behalf.</p>\n<h5>You might have heard that MetaMask is a “self-custodial” wallet; this refers to the fact that with MetaMask, you, and you alone, are in control of your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP), which grants access and control to your wallet addresses and the tokens assigned to them. No one can stop you from exercising that power; unless, of course, you share your SRP with them.</h5>\n<p><br>\nThat’s not the case with custodial staking; in this format, you are essentially entering into a client-provider relationship with the staking entity. You give them ETH, which they promise to stake, and then return to you the agreed-upon rewards.</p>\n<p>This may sound disadvantageous compared to liquid staking, but there are circumstances where it’s the obvious choice. Institutions, businesses, or foundations, for example, may wish to rely on a technically capable third party to manage their ETH stake for them. Additionally, these entities may be legally required to stake through an entity that has certain kinds of insurance, backing, or other guarantees. Maybe holding the keys themselves is, in fact, a liability.</p>\n<p>Another driving factor for custodial staking is that many people are unaware of the existence of self-custody wallets and decentralized staking protocols. They understand crypto to be a new kind of money, and therefore expect to deal with a bank or investment firm-like entity in order to interact with their crypto; that’s what they’re comfortable with. Even those who do have knowledge of, and even have and use, a self-custody wallet, may choose to stake with a custodial provider for the convenience of being able to quickly convert their rewards to fiat currency, or quickly add more to their staking position from fiat.</p>\n<h5>These, then, are the three main methods of staking ETH available today: “solo” staking, whether it be on a physical computer in your home or on a cloud computer; liquid staking through a protocol or provider, and custodial staking, often through a centralized exchange, or CEX.</h5>\n<p><br>\nThat said, this is web3, and who knows what might be built next.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</a></h2>\n<h3><a href=\"#so-when-is-a-network-a-dao-\">So: When is a network a DAO?</a></h3>\n<p><br>\n…given all that context, the question begins to take shape: If a network consists of a given number of people locking up their tokens into a decentralized protocol, which gives them rewards, and that community is governed by a system of votes and governance bodies who publish their voting protocols and their results on a public blockchain… How is Ethereum, for example, not just one big Decentralized Autonomous Organization?</p>\n<p><strong>And if we can use this technology to coordinate and manage a database that ensures billions and billions of dollars worth of value transparently and on a global scale, what’s stopping us from using this technology to build a world that’s better for us all?</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"최신","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5inNJ61Js8L6upbxjFtPQk","node_locale":"ko","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask

href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a>—an employee-led program that issues grants to developers <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/building-an-extensible-world-with-meta-mask-grants-dao/\">building impactful experiences</a> within the MetaMask ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to announce the first recipients of this initiative— <a href=\"https://agoric.com/\">Agoric</a> and <a href=\"https://www.safeheron.com/\">Safeheron</a>.</p>\n<h3>Agoric: laying the groundwork for an extensible internet</h3>\n<p>Agoric and MetaMask have meaningful history with the former providing tools and mentorship focused on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Helping keep MetaMask users safe</li>\n<li>Enabling new kinds of exciting extensibility.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By integrating Agoric’s tools, we found that we are able to achieve unprecedented supply chain security through initiatives like <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat#lavamoat\">LavaMoat</a>, and with Hardened JS (formerly “Secure EcmaScript”), we have been pioneering what it means to add new services to the wallet at runtime through <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a>.</p>\n<p>Through the funding of this $500,000 grant, Agoric is continuing their development of a series of open source tools that we think bridge the gap between security and a fun, fast-moving ecosystem.</p>\n<p>According to MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay, “At MetaMask, we are building a user-centric consent system, and I believe our work with Agoric will allow us to build a safer platform that empowers users to do more interesting things, enabling not only the composition of dynamic and resilient software but also extending into the social fabric.” You can hear him further discuss the role of Agoric’s SES (Secure EcmaScript) technology in the MetaMask wallet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPGnJf3e9DA&#x26;ab_channel=Agoric\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Agoric’s contributions to the security of the JavaScript ecosystem are unparalleled, and we’re proud to support their continued contributions to the free open-source community.</p>\n<h3>Safeheron: improving the key management experience</h3>\n<p>Safeheron and MetaMask are continuing their collaboration on bringing improved security and usability to MetaMask’s users. This project will revolve around improving MetaMask’s key management experience, specifically focused on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Helping users manage their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) to reduce phishing attacks</li>\n<li>Reducing the chance of keys being lost</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through the funding of this $35,000 grant, Safeheron will develop and security audit a key sharding solution across MetaMask Flask, the Keystone hardware wallet, and a mobile app (either MetaMask Mobile or an alternative).</p>\n<p>Using a 2/3 signing algorithm, two of these devices will be used to sign a transaction creating a multi-factor secure experience for the user. Due to the underlying Multi Party Computer (MPC) algorithm, the private keys will never be held in their entirety on one device—dramatically reducing the possibility of an attacker gaining these private keys and stealing the user’s funds. Furthermore, if a user were to lose 1 of their 3 devices, they can use their remaining 2 devices to issue a new key shard to a new device to maintain their security.</p>\n<p>MetaMask, Safeheron, and Keystone have already worked together to implement a <a href=\"https://blog.safeheron.com/blog/product/media-reports/safeheron-partners-with-metamask-on-mpc-security-solution\">2/2 MPC snap</a> and this grant will fund the evolution of this project into a 2/3 MPC snap.</p>\n<h3>Looking forward to a productive 2023</h3>\n<p>Following the launch of MetaMask Grants DAO, we are thrilled that so many projects have applied to receive funding. Build market alert?</p>\n<p>If you’re a developer, take a look at our Snaps wish list <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/request-for-proposals\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU-lqYv-F8mmbClf7Ib8k4BEsYceItxDB2FnY3VGma1DqhHg/viewform\">apply for a grant</a> to build out a thriving ecosystem with us.</p>\n<p><em>We can’t guarantee when we will review your request or that it will get approved, but know that our team will review the application pipeline as often as we can.
