I hope Titus Livy’s famous quote: “better late than never” duly applies. The second quarter of 2024 starkly juxtaposed Q1 regarding institutional on-chain activity. Thus far, this bull cycle has been in stark contrast to the previous cycle’s Cambrian application explosion. Accordingly, we have seen far fewer crypto fund formations and hear of Crypto VCs struggling to deploy capital. With the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, we have seen more traditional organisation adoption, and hence, interestingly, our fastest growing user segment has been organisations building on-chain.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) dedicated its Q2 to continued rapid innovation within our three product experiences. We tend to apply Marc Andreessen’s “It’s time to build” continually. We add more network coverage every quarter, increasing our uptimes and reducing our latency.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<h3><em>“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” – Albert Einstein</em></h3>\n<p>The MMI extension provides connectivity to all of web3, most notably the frontier of web3. There are many web3 connectors and an increasing handful of institutional options. MMI offers the most comprehensive access to web3 connectivity and institutional key management options. MMI is the only multi-custodial wallet that exists. We also provide enterprise-grade uptimes, reliability and consistency, and the industry's best customer support. We dedicated Q2 to our unwavering reliability strategy. We shipped a range of updates to ensure our users' highest uptimes and reliability. We also shipped user experience improvements, from improved settings to custodian connectivity via QR scanning (reducing latency to account importing).</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<h3><em>“Price is what you pay, value is what you get” – Warren Buffet</em></h3>\n<p>Our portfolio dashboard is a curated web3 read (view) and write (execution) institutional tool. Its sole focus is to empower an organisation to monitor, manage, control and report on all their crypto assets. We support all EVMs, Solana, Bitcoin and centralised exchange data. Our on-chain data shows detailed time-weighted profit and loss (P&#x26;L) and performance metrics. We offer <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">snapshot valuations</a>, where organisations can choose the exact time of day they want to value their assets. An organisation can consume, analyse, view and share these valuations via a read-only <a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">UI</a>, CSV or API.</p>\n<p>We dedicated our quarter to three main initiatives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In our focus on showing an organisation any asset, we added further centralised exchange data coverage anywhere with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g6w5_JbNYVU\">Binance and OKX integrations</a>. We also extended the number of DeFi protocols we cover regarding detailed performance and P&#x26;L data. Our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/mmis-defi-adapters-are-powering-the-future-of-defi/\">DeFi adapters</a>, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-apis-defi-data-decoded/#:~:text=An%20adapter%20aims%20to%20accomplish,create%20and%20update%20protocol%20positions.\">DeFi SDK, and APIs</a> power our portfolio dashboard, and we spent the quarter focused on ensuring maximum coverage for our users.</li>\n<li>We launched a complete user interface refresh, allowing more advanced monitoring and tracking.</li>\n<li>We launched our new pricing model, moving to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-metamask-institutional-portfolio-dashboard-login/\">seat-based pricing</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our new pricing model gives users more consistency and control over their costs. Along with this change, we shipped a delightful user experience for users to view, download and pay their monthly invoices (in crypto and Fiat) from the portfolio dashboard.</p>\n<h1>APIs</h1>\n<h3><em>“You want your customers to value your service” – Jeff Bezos</em></h3>\n<p>In Q2, we launched our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-apis-for-institutions/\">API suite</a> to empower organisations programmatically to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets. Today, we offer valuations, transaction history and detailed DeFi positions. In Q2, we added centralised exchange data to our API suite. We also improved latency and data freshness for our users.</p>\n<h1>Q3 2024</h1>\n<h3><em>“Forget goals. Value the process.” – Jim Bouton</em></h3>\n<p>In Q3, we will launch a series of new features to give further crypto access. Empowering organisations with the ability to monitor, manage, control and report on positions and also to be able to transact safely and securely. Users will see greater network coverage, in-depth valuations and attribution and a continued increase in key management solutions. All available via our user interfaces and our APIs. We will also be attending Token2049 and <a href=\"https://lu.ma/kufj7lft\">hosting a private event</a>.

A critical decision that users have to make is determining the best mode of asset custody—whether to choose a licensed full-custody service, self-custody via MPC providers or multisig smart contracts, or a multi-custody approach to diversify risk and optimize returns.</p>\n<p>However, safeguarding your assets is just the first step. The next challenge is ensuring secure and reliable connections to Web3, especially when managing millions in on-chain transactions. With so many Web3 wallets (connectors) available, choosing the right one can be daunting.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we outline the key factors to consider when evaluating the security of a Web3 wallet, providing a framework that will help institutional investors confidently navigate their journey into DeFi and Web3.</p>\n<h1>Key Considerations:</h1>\n<h4>1.  Security Culture, Audits, and Penetration Testing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engineering Team Expertise:</strong> Assess the experience and expertise of the engineering team. What is their track record, and how deeply do they understand Web3 security?</li>\n<li><strong>Engineering Resources:</strong> How many dedicated resources are allocated to the wallet? A well-supported engineering team is crucial for ongoing security and performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Code Origin:</strong> Was the wallet built from the ground up or is it a fork of another open-source project? Building from scratch often implies a more thorough understanding and control over the codebase.</li>\n<li><strong>Ecosystem Standing:</strong> Does the engineering team have influence within the ecosystem?

For fund managers, it’s more than just managing LPs’ funds and crafting killer strategies; it's also about meticulously tracking positions and ensuring precise P&#x26;L calculations. The ability to monitor allocations and performance can make or break a fund. Fund admins must reconcile portfolios accurately for their clients, while custodians are tasked with presenting a detailed overview of AUC, tokens, and positions.</p>\n<p>Accurate crypto data is crucial for this. Thanks to the emergence of many RPC and API providers over the past years, we no longer need to run clients and write command lines to get human-readable data from the blockchain. However, very few cater to the specific needs of organizations like funds, fund admins, treasuries, and CEXs that need to fetch and present complex data and information. For instance, if you are a fund running leveraged yield farming strategies across different protocols and chains, simply seeing the balance of the LP token received from a liquidity pool isn't very helpful when it comes to understanding the P&#x26;L of the position and the overall portfolio.</p>\n<h1>The Scalability Challenge</h1>\n<p>The existing approaches also struggle with scalability issues as providers have to constantly play catch-up with the market. Unlike TradFi, where everything is standardized and slow to change, the crypto market is a fast-changing landscape—new tokens, chains, and protocols are created daily, and new trends emerge every few months. For example, restaking, liquid re-staking, and point farming are new trends that have only emerged in the current bull cycle. Consequently, many funds and businesses revert to good old Excel spreadsheets when other solutions fall short. But manual processes eat up time and are prone to errors, especially when you are managing multiple custody/trading accounts across multiple chains.</p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the financial industry, eliminating inefficiencies in the system—there must be a better way to gather and read crypto data than hours of Excel marathons!</p>\n<h1>Enter the MetaMask Institutional (MMI) Reporting API</h1>\n<p>MMI is dedicated to onboarding all organizations on planet Earth to Web3. In order to achieve this mission, we are committed to solving the difficult challenges presented in the space to enable a delightful and frictionless user experience for enterprises.</p>\n<p>In our quest to simplify reading crypto data, apart from providing API access that retrieves basic information such as an <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/everything-you-need-to-know-about-metamask-institutionals-apis/\">overview of token, NFT balance, Defi positions</a>, we’ve launched APIs that cater to the specific reporting needs of enterprises that no one else in the space can offer. They include our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/\">Defi P&#x26;L and performance APIs</a>. The DeFi P&#x26;L and performance APIs are particularly unique as they are powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters\">MMI DeFi adapters</a> developed by the protocols themselves. The notion behind these adapters is to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/mmis-defi-adapters-are-powering-the-future-of-defi/\">solve the scalability issue</a> that was discussed earlier in this blog.</p>\n<p>Just like how ERC20 became an industry standard for utility tokens to make it easier for various platforms and protocols to integrate, MMI aims to define a standard for fetching data and interacting with various DeFi protocols, which often have unique interfaces and data structures. Instead of having the engineers to play the never ending catch-up with the crypto market, protocols/builders contribute to our Defi data standard by building adapters. An adapter aims to accomplish two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetch and transform underlying protocol data into a standardized format that can be easily used by portfolio dashboards.</li>\n<li>Generate transaction parameters to create and update protocol positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How Can Different Organizations Benefit?</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Crypto Funds</strong>\nAutomate your reporting and operations. Instead of wasting hours logging into different platforms, taking screenshots, and feeding data manually into Excel that is prone to human error, let our APIs do the heavy lifting, as your time is valuable.\n<a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">Click here</a> for an example of a daily valuation statement powered by our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot feature</a>, and it’s also <a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">available via API</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Crypto Fund Admins</strong>\nWhy hire additional headcount for manual Excel work when you can <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/#tag/Account\">leverage our APIs to automate portfolio reconciliation</a> for your clients? An automated approach enhances data accuracy and efficiency, thereby boosting customer satisfaction and retention. Also, with more efficient processes, your business can take on more clients, scale and generate more revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Custodians</strong>\nGo beyond presenting accurate AUC, token, and position overviews. Stand out from the competition by offering advanced and granular reporting functions. For instance, provide a detailed breakdown of the underlying assets that make up an LP token, including respective balances and P&#x26;L (see below example). This kind of transparency can set you apart in a crowded market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4mEtdpvvbL9p6mwTZawEY5/e134b1b23f0a979af249f54126fd2feb/MMI-API_Blog-1.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-1\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. Web3 Neo Banks, Wallets, and Dashboard Providers</strong>\nBe the pioneer in your region by offering premium Web3 reporting functions. Become the go-to platform, allowing users to check their crypto balances across all of their wallet addresses (e.g. MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Safe), providing a holistic view instead of just their holdings on your platform to increase stickiness. Or imagine offering internet banking-like features such as daily valuation statements to drive user engagement.\nEssentially you can build and whitelist all the features below (see screenshots) via the MMI API set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7Eu0RDtphC3L3lvfKC4NUr/954e1df2905993304e3092115e2514ad/MMI-API_Blog-2.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-2\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6JEotXh3Q08c0orIOf7g85/e44b49b9ea66f14764a1bc7f4c9e3dee/MMI-API_Blog-3.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-3\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3oJuBw1k3tY52Xg9ESU8iY/3cca5d058b29ad3b619b1e793fbd7a7f/MMI-API_Blog-4.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-4\"></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>To truly drive blockchain adoption and create widely-used DeFi killer apps, we must simplify the process for enterprises to read and integrate DeFi data.

How will you take payment?</strong></p>\n<p>We support invoice payment in ETH, USDC and USD.</p>\n<p><strong>5. When will I be invoiced?</strong></p>\n<p>Invoices will appear in the Portfolio Dashboard within 10 business days of the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong>6. When are invoices payable?</strong></p>\n<p>Invoices need to be paid within 30 days of invoicing.</p>\n<p><strong>7. How can I cancel my subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions are canceled by giving 30 day’s written notice.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How many different roles are available, and what can they do?</strong></p>\n<p>We have two roles within the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, Admin and Regular user roles. Admin users manage payments and can invite and delete users. Regular users will be invited to the dashboard. Admin users can create settings that apply at an organization-level. For example, how accounts are grouped at an organization level.</p>\n<p><strong>9. How many members can I add to the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>We have no limit to the number of members you can add to an organization.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Will the role settings impact performing any activities natively on the MMI platform? E.g. swapping, staking, or exporting historic transactions</strong></p>\n<p>The role settings currently do not impact access levels or activities within MMI. We will roll out more roles and permissions over time.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many admin roles can one account have? What if I’d like to have multiple admins as there are a few key decision makers within the organization. How will this work? And will they have rights to override each other?</strong></p>\n<p>You can have multiple admins in an organization. All admins will have the same access and abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>12.

How do I add accounts to my organization within the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are three ways to add accounts into the portfolio dashboard. Firstly when you transact with custodial accounts, we automatically detect and add these accounts to your organization. When you add new accounts into the Extension that you have not yet transacted with nor are part of your organization, we provide a helpful notice that we have detected new accounts not yet part of your organization and ask if you want to add them to your organization. Lastly, you can navigate to the Portfolio Dashboard’s accounts section and add any accounts you would like to your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>14. How many bundles can I create within the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no limits to the number of bundles you can create.</p>\n<p><strong>15.

In order to onboard to MMI, invite Team members and give them access to the MMI Extension, organizations have to onboard the Portfolio Dashboard.  As all invoicing occurs via the Portfolio Dashboard access is also important.</p>\n<p><strong>16. What do I do when I see an error message when onboarding?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are seeing an error message during onboarding it is either one of the following reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are signing up but you are not the primary point of contact in your organization</li>\n<li>You are a new user and are not in our system</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the former, please contact the administrator in your organization to be invited to your organization.
