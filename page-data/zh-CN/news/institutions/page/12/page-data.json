embrace the sea that we have crossed. Given that late December often leads to both traditions and reflections, I thought I would take advantage of the trend (a habit from an old portfolio manager).</p>\n<p>Today, I’ll establish a tradition of reflection by providing a periodic update to you on the technology we have built, the milestones we have reached, and a glimpse of the progress yet to come.</p>\n<p>For those of you who I’ve had the pleasure of meeting, you will know I am a massive proponent of the <a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\">1,000 true fan philosophy</a>. Along with building for what we call “tier-1 user needs”, the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> (MMI) team follows product and design principles focused on identifying painkillers (over vitamins) to build the absolute best product for and with you.</p>\n<h2>Starting from First Principles</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1mQjqtROz48xVyI7GBScwl/1abb1cae8ca75f5234a97c670a1c32d6/Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-7.00.39-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2021-12-22-at-7.00.39-PM\"></p>\n<p>MMI’s vision is to bridge all organizations on planet earth into Web3—from crypto funds to traditional financial organisations to NGOs in Africa. We believe Web3 will eat the world as it makes the creation, storage, and distribution of financial assets essentially free.</p>\n<p>This new world creates fundamentally more distributed, efficient, transparent, and cost-effective capital markets to improve the financial opportunities for everyone, everywhere.</p>\n<p>MMI was built to provide unrivalled access to Web3, offering the most trusted wallet within the ecosystem alongside the ability to connect to Qualified Custodians and Custody technology providers.</p>\n<p>Today, we work with crypto funds, market makers, prime brokers, hedge funds and custodians across the globe. Given the sophisticated needs of our users, we think deeply about the entire transaction-flow process for crypto institutions—from onramps, custody, research and pre-trade compliance, to execution, yield, analytics, monitoring and reporting—a capital allocation stack mental model if you will.</p>\n<p>Within this capital allocation stack, we focus on two core principles: First, partnering with world-class businesses to address our users’ needs; and second, where we at ConsenSys, can provide unique value to our users and partners.</p>\n<p>Below is a review of the steps we’ve taken in each quarter across this capital allocation stack.</p>\n<h2>Q1</h2>\n<p>Q1 saw the birth of the blue fox and its first usage by funds across the globe. On the 31ts of January, we built and launched limited Beta access to MetaMask Institutional with our first custodian partner. Implementing a wider V1 release on the 31st of March, we launched with some of the  most  renowned crypto funds, exchanges, and primer brokers as our clients. Within the quarter we also implemented a range of additional features spanning from additional EVM chain support by our custodian partner to EIP-712 signing. We also established one of our core product principles to speak with our users daily. This principle means the MMI team’s day usually starts with a call with a fund in Asia and ends with a call with a fund on the west coast.</p>\n<h2>Q2</h2>\n<p>During the second quarter, we built and launched MMI research, a service focused on identifying valuable information and Alpha opportunities within a DYOR world. An example of this Alpha can be found by simply looking at our last two newsletters, where we identified the probable market movement based on the YFI governance proposals.</p>\n<p>MMI research originally consisted of our weekly governance newsletter. This has now expanded to include a Layer 2 analysis and a monthly Tokenomics report. We are also rolling out a range of Macro content in 2022. Today, the MMI Research distribution list consists of the foremost Crypto funds globally and the statistics around its consumption display that the research is among the most valuable content ConsenSys offers.</p>\n<p>On the product side, we built KYT Compliance into MMI, providing pre and post-trade compliance on all DeFi activity. Our unique selling proposition remains the depth and breadth of analysis we provide along with our focus on DeFi pools. Our aim is to not only be a bridge into Web3, but specifically an institution-compliant bridge. Today, 43% of all MMI users are using our compliance feature. We are also engaging with large traditional financial institutions, providing a tool and risk framework for them to access DeFi yield opportunities.</p>\n<p>Lastly, product can only exist with growth. Thus, we built a $4bn AUM Early Adopter Programme with crypto funds and prime brokers across the globe, consequently providing early access to our latest features.</p>\n<h2>Q3</h2>\n<p>Last quarter, we built Jupiter Custody. A demo custodian that many of you would have seen during our demos of the product. Jupiter was built strategically, as it allows us to compress the integration time with our custodian partners by 200%.</p>\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">we announced our next 3 custodian partners</a> and integrated and launched with a second custodian partner: Qredo offers decentralised crypto custody secured by Multi-Party Computation (MPC).</p>\n<p>We also laid the groundwork for a large initiative outside of the MMI extension, implementing our vision of what the Institutional DeFi experience should be. Lastly, we expanded our Early Adopter Programme by 25%.</p>\n<h1>Q4</h1>\n<p>This quarter, we launched our third and fourth custodian integrations—going live with our partnership with Cactus Custody, the largest qualified custodian in Asia at the start of November, and launching with Bitgo, one of the largest global custodians with $65bn in Assets Under Custody a month later. Q4 was also one of the busiest periods in writing new code as we built the innovations we are implementing outside of the extension.</p>\n<h2><em>“The numbers go to 11”</em></h2>\n<p>There is quite a lot to share about MMI over the next 90 days, and you’ll hear far more thoughtful and detailed roadmap updates in coming posts. However, given that we have a series of public announcements throughout Q1, the MMI marketing and PR teams have implemented a smart contract gag order.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the wait won’t be long and you will be hearing from us in January. In the meantime, if you want to reach out to us, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:mmi@consenys.net\">mmi@consensys.net</a>.</p>\n<h2>To the Moon, GMI, and Up only 2022</h2>\n<p>The last thing to say is that I wish you and yours Seasons’ Greetings from the entire MetaMask Institutional team. We wish you and your team all the best for the new year.</p>\n<p><strong>Johann Bornmann</strong>\nProduct Lead</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"机构","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"7JWQ8R5yVTxJKVbt81HYsT","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Why DeFi is the Future of Finance","slug":"why-defi-is-the-future-of-finance","subtitle":"DeFi is giving TradFi a run for its money by reducing the cost of financing for organizations.

While we’re not quite there yet, there is a good reason why DeFi has captured the popular imagination: the total value locked in DeFi protocols has surpassed $100B.</p>\n<p>That’s not all. Ethereum, which accounts for over 68% of collateral in DeFi, settled $6 trillion worth of transactions in the twelve months to October 2021.</p>\n<p>The market value of Ethereum-based DeFi transactions is proof enough that it is giving TradFi a run for its money. In addition, DeFi may soon be the preferred choice for institutions to fulfill their credit needs due to its ability to provide financing at more competitive rates when compared with TradFi.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how DeFi makes cheaper financing possible.</p>\n<p>Financial incumbents in the TradFi space have a high cost of servicing clients, right from onboarding, and trade execution, to post-trade activities such as clearing and settlement. TradFi institutions spend about $20B in trade processing annually, according to an estimate by The Bank of England. TradFi can save up to 80% of post-trade settlement expenses by leveraging distributed-ledger technology (DLT).</p>\n<p>The high cost of servicing clients and legacy infrastructure means that TradFi has limited financial innovation ability. Many banks and central securities depositories are piloting tokenization projects that look to improve existing asset classes. These projects, while showing evidence of technical feasibility, fail to go live.</p>\n<p>The business case for these projects is a tough one to make when accounting for the cost of migrating to a new system.To add to this, there is the challenge of adjusting existing processes, and stakeholder and user behaviour, in line with any new technology. We saw similar behaviour when sales and trading desks moved from voice to digital. New business divisions with differently skilled personnel grew the digital business, while the personnel and systems dedicated to voice declined.</p>\n<p>DeFi is well placed to disrupt TradFi with new, and innovative financing options as it does not use any of the TradFi structures to build its alternative financing structures. “It took Tesla to reimagine a better user experience. Ford or Toyota could not have done this without disrupting existing sales models,” says Elizabeth Matthew, Executive Director at Consensys.</p>\n<p>The lack of existing market infrastructure solutions within DeFi provide a fertile ground to rethink the user experience in the capital markets lifecycle. This helps create new financial primitives, alternate financing structures and yield generating opportunities. DeFi now consists of over 17,000 protocols such as Aave, Compound and Uniswap for lending, borrowing, staking, hedging, swapping and yield farming.</p>\n<p>DeFi has also dramatically shrunk the cost of manufacturing and distributing various assets, similar to what the internet did for publishing and advertising. One reason for these lower costs is DeFi’s peer-to-peer lending mechanism that strips out the third-party intermediary. This means that an institution looking to access credit can do so without having to pay a fee to a bank or another financial institution to grant that access.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI), the institution-compliant version of the most used and trusted DeFi wallet MetaMask, provides access to DeFi’s unbound innovation with the widest access across EVM-compatible protocols. This is because almost all dapps are built to integrate with MetaMask. Through MMI, organizations can implement investment strategies for trading, lending, yield farming, and more.</p>\n<p>Only MMI provides unrivaled access to DeFi without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MetaMask Institutional</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"机构","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"74J8Zw5escwtS1RqCjNSId","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Checklist for Institutions: Getting Started in DeFi","slug":"checklist-for-institutions-getting-started-in-defi","subtitle":"Four steps to prepare crypto funds, family offices, and financial institutions to access and engage in DeFi.","image":{"title":"Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp?w=285&h=189&q=80&fm=webp 285w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp?w=570&h=378&q=80&fm=webp 570w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=webp 1140w","sizes":"(min-width: 1140px) 1140px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1272}},"publishDate":"September 20, 2021","authors":[{"name":"Nicole Adarme","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/defi/\">Decentralized finance</a>—DeFi—refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by the Ethereum blockchain.

Custodians store private keys, approve, and sign transactions. They interact directly with broker/dealers and exchanges to facilitate transactions for fund managers. They are paramount to safely acquiring and holding crypto assets.</p>\n<p>The best custodians aggregate all liquidity opportunities for fund managers so funds can choose from the best prices across all market sources.</p>\n<h2>Different Institutional Custody Requirements</h2>\n<p>Managers who run funds with $1–10M of family and friends’ money will have very different businesses to funds that have $150M+ assets under management (AUM). If a manager is primarily allocating assets on behalf of friends and family, their investors will likely be more lenient in terms of the safeguards required to ensure that manager is operating their business correctly. This leniency comes from a place of trust.</p>\n<h3>Small Funds and Family Offices</h3>\n<p>With this trust, many small funds choose to self-custody their assets—meaning they do not use a third-party custodian. This choice allows small funds to save on management fees and other costly third-party services. Foregoing <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/so-you-want-to-start-a-crypto-fund/\">third-party services</a>, like custodians, also reduces some counterparty risk. For example, in the worst cases, rare technical failures by a custodian could lead to a loss of access to funds.</p>\n<p>Not using third-party services may work absolutely fine for family offices, but there are of course associated risks: Without third parties, fund managers could withhold or distort information, or abscond with funds. Fund managers may also not be able to provide the same depth and transparency on trading operations that qualified fund administrators can—so trust is a big deal!</p>\n<h3>Large Funds and Financial Institutions</h3>\n<p>As a fund grows into taking capital from larger institutional allocators such as pension funds and endowments, they become subject to far more rigorous requirements in order to ensure fund managers are acting in compliance with regulations and are properly safeguarding their clients’ assets. Generally, as fund allocations get larger, more due diligence is required.</p>\n<p>The US requires established funds to use qualified custodians which are SEC approved when AUM surpasses $150M. When a fund’s assets surpass $150M in outside capital, they have to both register with the SEC and are <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/bulletincustody\">legally required</a> to custody their assets with a qualified custodian. In addition, a fund manager must distribute thorough account statements and notify clients regarding how their assets are being held. They must also enter into a written agreement with an independent public accountant to examine those assets on a surprise basis every year.</p>\n<p>Thus, while smaller funds and entities like family offices, who purely invest one family’s assets, might not require third-party service providers like custodians, larger funds will.</p>\n<h2>Custody Solutions with MetaMask Institutional</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is the world’s most used and trusted DeFi wallet.
