While we’re not quite there yet, there is a good reason why DeFi has captured the popular imagination: the total value locked in DeFi protocols has surpassed $100B.</p>\n<p>That’s not all. Ethereum, which accounts for over 68% of collateral in DeFi, settled $6 trillion worth of transactions in the twelve months to October 2021.</p>\n<p>The market value of Ethereum-based DeFi transactions is proof enough that it is giving TradFi a run for its money. In addition, DeFi may soon be the preferred choice for institutions to fulfill their credit needs due to its ability to provide financing at more competitive rates when compared with TradFi.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how DeFi makes cheaper financing possible.</p>\n<p>Financial incumbents in the TradFi space have a high cost of servicing clients, right from onboarding, and trade execution, to post-trade activities such as clearing and settlement. TradFi institutions spend about $20B in trade processing annually, according to an estimate by The Bank of England. TradFi can save up to 80% of post-trade settlement expenses by leveraging distributed-ledger technology (DLT).</p>\n<p>The high cost of servicing clients and legacy infrastructure means that TradFi has limited financial innovation ability. Many banks and central securities depositories are piloting tokenization projects that look to improve existing asset classes. These projects, while showing evidence of technical feasibility, fail to go live.</p>\n<p>The business case for these projects is a tough one to make when accounting for the cost of migrating to a new system.To add to this, there is the challenge of adjusting existing processes, and stakeholder and user behaviour, in line with any new technology. We saw similar behaviour when sales and trading desks moved from voice to digital. New business divisions with differently skilled personnel grew the digital business, while the personnel and systems dedicated to voice declined.</p>\n<p>DeFi is well placed to disrupt TradFi with new, and innovative financing options as it does not use any of the TradFi structures to build its alternative financing structures. “It took Tesla to reimagine a better user experience. Ford or Toyota could not have done this without disrupting existing sales models,” says Elizabeth Matthew, Executive Director at Consensys.</p>\n<p>The lack of existing market infrastructure solutions within DeFi provide a fertile ground to rethink the user experience in the capital markets lifecycle. This helps create new financial primitives, alternate financing structures and yield generating opportunities. DeFi now consists of over 17,000 protocols such as Aave, Compound and Uniswap for lending, borrowing, staking, hedging, swapping and yield farming.</p>\n<p>DeFi has also dramatically shrunk the cost of manufacturing and distributing various assets, similar to what the internet did for publishing and advertising. One reason for these lower costs is DeFi’s peer-to-peer lending mechanism that strips out the third-party intermediary. This means that an institution looking to access credit can do so without having to pay a fee to a bank or another financial institution to grant that access.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI), the institution-compliant version of the most used and trusted DeFi wallet MetaMask, provides access to DeFi’s unbound innovation with the widest access across EVM-compatible protocols. This is because almost all dapps are built to integrate with MetaMask. Through MMI, organizations can implement investment strategies for trading, lending, yield farming, and more.</p>\n<p>Only MMI provides unrivaled access to DeFi without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MetaMask Institutional</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"机构","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"74J8Zw5escwtS1RqCjNSId","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Checklist for Institutions: Getting Started in DeFi","slug":"checklist-for-institutions-getting-started-in-defi","subtitle":"Four steps to prepare crypto funds, family offices, and financial institutions to access and engage in DeFi.","image":{"title":"Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp?w=285&h=189&q=80&fm=webp 285w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp?w=570&h=378&q=80&fm=webp 570w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/8eQgdmxIwE5yMZWud6I2w/c256ea865eb7bf506a0bb682bb44c27a/Getting-Started-in-DeFi-Blog.webp?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=webp 1140w","sizes":"(min-width: 1140px) 1140px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1272}},"publishDate":"September 20, 2021","authors":[{"name":"Nicole Adarme","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/defi/\">Decentralized finance</a>—DeFi—refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by the Ethereum blockchain.

Custodians store private keys, approve, and sign transactions. They interact directly with broker/dealers and exchanges to facilitate transactions for fund managers. They are paramount to safely acquiring and holding crypto assets.</p>\n<p>The best custodians aggregate all liquidity opportunities for fund managers so funds can choose from the best prices across all market sources.</p>\n<h2>Different Institutional Custody Requirements</h2>\n<p>Managers who run funds with $1–10M of family and friends’ money will have very different businesses to funds that have $150M+ assets under management (AUM). If a manager is primarily allocating assets on behalf of friends and family, their investors will likely be more lenient in terms of the safeguards required to ensure that manager is operating their business correctly. This leniency comes from a place of trust.</p>\n<h3>Small Funds and Family Offices</h3>\n<p>With this trust, many small funds choose to self-custody their assets—meaning they do not use a third-party custodian. This choice allows small funds to save on management fees and other costly third-party services. Foregoing <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/so-you-want-to-start-a-crypto-fund/\">third-party services</a>, like custodians, also reduces some counterparty risk. For example, in the worst cases, rare technical failures by a custodian could lead to a loss of access to funds.</p>\n<p>Not using third-party services may work absolutely fine for family offices, but there are of course associated risks: Without third parties, fund managers could withhold or distort information, or abscond with funds. Fund managers may also not be able to provide the same depth and transparency on trading operations that qualified fund administrators can—so trust is a big deal!</p>\n<h3>Large Funds and Financial Institutions</h3>\n<p>As a fund grows into taking capital from larger institutional allocators such as pension funds and endowments, they become subject to far more rigorous requirements in order to ensure fund managers are acting in compliance with regulations and are properly safeguarding their clients’ assets. Generally, as fund allocations get larger, more due diligence is required.</p>\n<p>The US requires established funds to use qualified custodians which are SEC approved when AUM surpasses $150M. When a fund’s assets surpass $150M in outside capital, they have to both register with the SEC and are <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/bulletincustody\">legally required</a> to custody their assets with a qualified custodian. In addition, a fund manager must distribute thorough account statements and notify clients regarding how their assets are being held. They must also enter into a written agreement with an independent public accountant to examine those assets on a surprise basis every year.</p>\n<p>Thus, while smaller funds and entities like family offices, who purely invest one family’s assets, might not require third-party service providers like custodians, larger funds will.</p>\n<h2>Custody Solutions with MetaMask Institutional</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is the world’s most used and trusted DeFi wallet.

That’s what’s gonna save the human race.” — Pete Seeger\n*</p>\n<p>Decentralized Finance, more commonly known as DeFi, is fundamentally changing the entire financial system. The primary financial needs, namely lending, borrowing, swapping, hedging, and asset management, are being rebuilt and re-architected from first principles—with more transparency and interoperability. Adoption cycles within DeFi have been led by the so-called DeFi Degens, the innovators who have built the technology, and the communities who continue to push and lead innovation within this space. Similar to the start of the internet, DeFi can, and will, change the world. These breakthrough innovations often lead to stellar investment opportunities, therefore, it’s not surprising institutional investors have followed suit.</p>\n<p>The institutional investor landscape is vast, spanning from small crypto funds to financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Mapping the needs of such a vast array of investors is a difficult task, given the countless variables at play—From fund sizes, investment mandates, jurisdictions, operational infrastructure, risk management, and of course compliance, and regulation. Yet, 5 broad themes apply to many if not most of the institutional investors that want to participate in DeFi. Let’s step through them.</p>\n<h1>Access</h1>\n<p>DeFi access can be achieved through two main execution venues. The first is indirect via the limited number of centralized crypto exchanges, offering access to (often, a limited number of) tokens from some well known DeFi Primitive. Yet, to access DeFi directly, which means access to the tens of thousands of DeFi tokens and DeFi protocols that exist today, institutions require a Web3 wallet. Today, there are many wallets available in the market. However, the vast majority of primitives build first and foremost to connect with MetaMask.</p>\n<p>With over 10M monthly active users, MetaMask is by far the most used and trusted wallet in this space.</p>\n<h2>Custody</h2>\n<p>Access goes hand in hand with risk management. Institutions must access DeFi in a way that aligns with safety, security, and operational requirements. This entails the institutional requirement of storing private keys, most often held on Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or Multi-Party Computation (MPCs) custody tech and qualified custodians. Most wallets today offer single key storage. This is problematic for institutions, because it means any member of an investment firm that has access to the private keys has the power to move assets anywhere across networks—a clear security risk. A fundamental institutional need therefore is not just a wallet, but custody, multi-signature, or MPC to ensure a secure signing process.</p>\n<p>Today, there are two wallets in the market that connect to custodians. MetaMask Institutional is one.</p>\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\n<p>Often institutions execute their trades from the walled garden of their custodian accounts, trading on centralized exchanges to move assets. Two years ago all trading by crypto funds occured through centralized exchanges! Yet, with the rise of DeFi, direct access has increased, often offering a more efficient route into the asset class—but this brings challenges. As institutions leave their walled custodian gardens, it becomes incredibly difficult to track their assets, yields, attribution of Annual Percentage Yields (APY), and risk management around their positions.</p>\n<p>Today, many fantastic DeFi projects exist to monitor these positions. However, none have been built to cater to the institutional market—until MetaMask Institutional.</p>\n<h2>Reporting</h2>\n<p>A new financial world gives rise to new conventions—from airdrops to governance tokens. For example, yield farming actively across DeFi entails building complex trading strategies that include staking reward tokens across multiple primitives. These positions generate capital gains, additional governance tokens, and APYs. Price and total return performance require accurate reporting by fund administrators to fund investors. Given how new and vastly expanding this ecosystem is, fund administrators are still coming to terms with the jargon, conventions, technical details and reporting. Institutional investors need reporting tools that provide detailed transaction data for their fund administrators and investors.</p>\n<p>Something we are actively working on.</p>\n<h2>Compliance</h2>\n<p>A core feature of DeFi is decentralized pools made of pseudonymous counterparties. This feature can become a hindrance for large parts of the institutional investor space. Unknown counterparties expose the risks of interacting with sanctioned countries and nefarious counterparts—risks that can lead to fines and fund closures by regulators. Today, many tools exist in the market to track ‘Know Your Transaction’ (KYT) risks, identifying the flow of funds risk. Yet, the depth and breadth required to step into DeFi pools require analysis of all transfers within a transaction and not just the transactions themselves. This means it’s important that any tools evaluated in the market need to provide risk management within DeFi itself.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional’s compliance features include groundbreaking compliance on DeFi pools with unmatched depth and breadth on pre and post-trade KYT mechanisms.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Featured Insight Report</h3>\n<h2>DeFi for Institutions</h2>\n<p>We cover this and more in our “DeFi for Institutions” report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The surge in institutional adoption of blockchain and digital assets</li>\n<li>The numerous opportunities emerging in the DeFi space</li>\n<li>Different ways institutions can get started accessing, investing, and participating in DeFi</li>\n<li>DeFi solutions by Consensys</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://insights.consensys.io/defi-for-institutions-report-2021\">Download Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>DeFi is changing the world—particularly the financial services and institutional investment landscape.
