However, the complexity of blockchain protocols like Ethereum necessitates an interface for users to harness this potential. 100 million users later, MetaMask has become that interface for many, although it’s got here despite a bit of a problem.</p>\n<p>That problem is the fact that every user who wants to claim a self-custodial wallet with MetaMask needs to record a twelve-word <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432\">Secret Recovery Phrase</a> as they are onboarded. These twelve words form the crux of the MetaMask experience, generating the cryptographic keys that create the accounts holding valuable assets.</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/hJgxOej0e1AUdixI7ekYg/6c8be8608e2849bae86c75f6f35f02e6/confirm_SRP.png\" alt=\"confirm SRP\" width=\"744\" height=\"407\" />\n<p>When MetaMask started over seven years ago the Secret Recovery Phrase was an elegant solution to the problem of representing cryptographic keys (having its roots in the Bitcoin community <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/e6abf7e66d7a499696dc9ef152f2c9eaa5b1b8ef\">as far back as 2013</a>). The corresponding cryptographic algorithm is incredibly scalable, interoperable, and ultimately gives users a uniquely secure method to transport potentially limitless amounts of value around the world providing they can keep those twelve-words secret and safe.</p>\n<p>However, maintaining the secrecy and safety of these twelve-words is a daunting task. I’ve personally read countless heart wrenching stories of MetaMask users reporting they’ve lost their twelve-words and so cannot access their funds anymore. Worse still, users often fall prey to phishing scams, handing over their Secret Recovery Phrase and having their assets stolen. This single point of failure also presents a tempting target for hackers.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit clichéd for anyone familiar with this problem to reiterate once again, but there has to be a better way.</p>\n<h3>Hardware Wallet Integrations As A Stepping Stone</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>For a while, MetaMask attempted to solve some of the problems with the Secret Recovery Phrase by integrating as many different hardware wallets as possible. These are devices that store cryptographic keys offline, and so make it much more <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/security-in-web3\">difficult for a hacker to infiltrate</a>. Following this strategy, we started to integrate all the major hardware wallets available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/20uoX5DMabgECizKMxcqmD/2149c4aca79c7e35613ebdf8f10199ef/hardware_wallets.jpeg\" alt=\"hardware wallets\"></p>\n<p>The Grid+ Lattice 1, Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, and Keystone Pro are just some of the hardware wallets integrated with MetaMask. More info at <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4408552261275-Hardware-Wallet-Hub\">MetaMask’s hardware wallet hub.</a></p>\n<p>However, these integrations are labor intensive, technically challenging, and require careful partnership management. By way of example, our <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-metamask-strengthen-partnership-ledger-nano-x-soon-compatible-with-metamask-mobile-app\">MetaMask Mobile Ledger integration</a> has been delayed by over a year (we’re still <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/8246\">working on it though</a>, I promise!). Additionally, as a result of these challenges, we’ve had to say “no” to numerous other integration requests over the years, even when a company has come to us with a fully functioning branch of the MetaMask codebase supporting their product (sorry <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/12097\">BitBox</a>!). With everything else we’re trying to accomplish, it’s just impossible to spare the time to review those hundreds of lines of code and then finally merge, while also ensuring our high security and stability standards.</p>\n<p>This has never felt right. A lot of us at MetaMask, myself included, got involved in this industry due to its decentralized permissionless promise, not to become de-facto gatekeepers. To remedy this problem to a degree, we worked with <a href=\"https://keyst.one/\">Keystone</a> to integrate a permissionless method of <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/metamask-x-keystone-how-to-benefit-from-hardware-wallet-security-using-transparent-qr-code\">integrating hardware wallets into MetaMask via QR codes</a>. Now as long as a third party hardware wallet manufacturer can adopt this QR code connectivity standard (<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4527\">ERC-4527</a>) they can integrate with MetaMask without ever engaging with us. Gone was the temporary role of being a hardware wallet integration gatekeeper.</p>\n<p>Although our industry never sits still.</p>\n<h3>Account Management Snaps As The Future</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Over the past few years our industry has seen huge advancements in account management. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation\">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> has become quicker and more performant to allow the generation of cryptographic keys across different nodes: eliminating single sources of failure in certain contexts. Smart contract accounts are also becoming more accessible and cheaper via various Ethereum scaling solutions and improvements in line with <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337\">ERC-4337</a>: say hello to social recovery and biometric signing. Hardware wallets also continue to develop: see the recent announcements of the new <a href=\"https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-stax\">Ledger Stax</a>, <a href=\"https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-3\">Trezor Safe 3</a>, and <a href=\"https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-3pro\">Keystone 3 Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, it’s impossible for one team to integrate and then maintain all of these account management solutions. Moreover, betting on a single solution is probably just as unfeasible, given the rapid pace of our industry and the diverse needs of the next billion blockchain users that MetaMask aims to serve.</p>\n<p>The only way to begin imagining how to integrate all of these different account management solutions is to <strong>make the wallet more community driven</strong>, by reinventing the software of the wallet entirely, which is precisely what MetaMask Snaps does. In the words of MetaMask's co-founder Dan Finlay an end goal of MetaMask Snaps is \"<a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/snaps-in-metamask-stable-and-where-we-go-from-here/#:~:text=permissionless%20computing\">permissionless computing</a>\". This is a lofty goal when making a security-sensitive product, but it’s perhaps the only way to drive MetaMask towards the vision of creating a gateway to web3 for everyone.</p>\n<p>Today marks a critical milestone in that journey as we enable new Snap APIs to enable community driven features around one of the most important components of any wallet – account management – to start chipping away at the problems associated with the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>\n<p>To enable new account management experiences we’re launching the powerful <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> today in MetaMask Extension, which any developer can use to bring their account management ideas to MetaMask. Launching any product update like this is daunting, which is why today also marks the beginning of our Experimental Beta program for Account Management Snaps. We didn’t want to continue building out this functionality behind closed doors, so if you’re a power-user comfortable testing out advanced features, we invite you to test out our first three Snaps in this category (<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>) and to <a href=\"https://feedback.metamask.io/account-management-snaps\">let us know what you think.</a></p>\n<h3>Account Management Snaps In Action</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>You can install these new Snaps via the official <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Snaps Directory</a>, however you can also go to the Experimental Settings in the MetaMask Extension to test a new Account Management Snap interface. Once an Account Management Snap is installed and set up, it will appear in your MetaMask Account List and function like any other account in MetaMask, such as allowing you to transact and interact with dapps.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6bmintWlFPuldZ6E9pF5Sz/805b0f173f657fc626659f97e4d28f53/selectanaccount.png\" alt=\"selectanaccount\"></p>\n<p>Please note that all Snaps are third-party services and are used at your own risk. However, we're excited by what the community has already created. The first version of the Keyring API is particularly well-suited to Multi-Factor Authentication experiences powered by MPC, reducing the single point of failure limitation of the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>\n<h3>Silent Shard</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Silent Shard creates a two-factor-authentication experience with MetaMask’s Extension and a companion smartphone app. For added usability, you can save a part of your private key in your Apple or Google password manager.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ewBdIQuKg4?si=vZVrV8aMgsliTHrK\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <button style=\"font-size: 17px; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer;\">Install Snap</button>\n</a>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>Safeheron</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Safeheron is a 2/3 multi-factor-authentication experience between MetaMask Extension and two smartphone apps.

For Account Management Snaps we’re also requiring an additional audit on their MPC code (or equivalent like a smart contract of hardware wallet) with that being made publicly available as well. Over time we’ll eventually get towards a true <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/permissionless-innovation-and-you/\">permissionless ecosystem</a> and if that is something important to you today, we recommend our developer-centric product <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth confirming that the Keyring API has an architecture where these Snaps cannot access your existing MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase. These new Snaps must either generate an entirely new private key or derive an entirely new private key from your Secret Recovery Phrase that prevents them from accessing other Ethereum accounts. Account Management Snaps also benefit from the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/execution-environment\">secure sandboxed execution environment</a> that all Snaps run in.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We're thrilled about today's release, and this is just the beginning. We’re confident that the first Snaps to use the new Keyring API will continue to improve, and we’re also planning to enhance the Keyring API itself.

But even with the Seal 911 group of auditors and white-hat hackers that was created last August, are we anywhere close to ready for the carnage that might come with the next bull run? Monahan talks about the dangers of bad actors ranging from \"script-kiddies'' to APTs, and the lack of accountability when protocols get hacked.

The email service provider MailerLite, allegedly hacked, is currently investigating the issue. The phishing emails contained malicious links leading to a multi-chain address. WalletConnect and other Web3 users have been targeted with emails promoting a launchpad launch and a fake Token Terminal beta launch, both containing links to fictitious airdrops. Cybersecurity platform Hudson Rock suggests that a malware program found on a MailerLite employee's computer might have been used to gain access to MailerLite’s servers for data theft and further attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To enhance protection against phishing attacks, users should approach unsolicited emails with caution, regularly update and run antivirus software, and <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/19878220833947-How-to-turn-on-Blockaid-security-alerts\">enable Blockaid security alerts</a> in their MetaMask settings.

This is a common campaign that scammers with a good understanding of Ethereum smart contracts use to spoof Etherscan logs. The scam involves sending airdrops that appear to come from reputable sources to token holders, who are then directed to a fraudulent website where they are tricked into authorizing the attacker to drain their wallets. The scam is sophisticated, utilizing complex smart contract interactions and a proxy contract to obfuscate the true nature of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should approach unsolicited airdrops with caution, scrutinize embedded links in digital assets, and understand the implications of interacting with smart contracts. Users should stay informed about scam tactics, use trusted tools for verifying transactions, and double-check sources of airdrops or transactions. Safe browsing practices and securing assets, such as using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, are recommended. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, education, caution, and skepticism remain key defenses against potential threats.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://securelist.com/new-macos-backdoor-crypto-stealer/111778/\">Cracked Software Loaded with Backdoors to Steal Cryptocurrency</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Kaspersky discovered a sophisticated macOS malware campaign that targets users through cracked apps found on pirating websites. The malware, embedded in repackaged pre-cracked applications, initiates an infection through a Trojan proxy and a post-install script. The malware is capable of running on macOS Ventura 13.6 and later, suggesting a focus on users of newer operating systems. The malware uses a program named \"Activator\" to execute its payload, which includes stealing cryptocurrency wallets. The malware campaign is still a work-in-progress, with the operators frequently updating the malicious scripts. The final payload is a backdoor that can run any scripts with administrator privileges and replace Exodus and Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet applications with infected versions that steal secret recovery phrases.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To safeguard against malware attacks, users should strictly download and install applications from official platforms or trusted third-party app stores, avoiding unverified or pirating websites. It's crucial to keep your operating system and all applications updated, as updates often include security patches that guard against known vulnerabilities. Utilizing reliable antivirus or anti-malware software, which should be regularly updated, can help detect and eliminate many types of malware.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"安全","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"最新","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"3mbzNP6O57YEp0Dfp7WHQg","node_locale":"zh-CN","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Navigate Validator Staking through MetaMask Portfolio","slug":"navigate-validator-staking-through-metamask-portfolio","subtitle":"MetaMask Portfolio lets you secure the Ethereum network and earn rewards without maintaining nodes.
