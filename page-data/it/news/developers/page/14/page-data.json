For the average person, trying to wrap your head around how blockchain technology works, what is gas, or how to bridge assets can be a daunting task. Unfamiliar technical words, new patterns, and lack of education are some major user experience (UX) issues in web3 slowing down mass adoption.</p>\n<p>When I decided to focus my career on designing web3 products, my main motivation was the huge UX challenge to democratize the use of crypto, especially to make self-custodial wallets secure and easy to use. But like any big task, this challenge requires  collective effort—it needs the ideas and perspectives of more designers, and above all, it needs the web3 space to give UX the importance that it deserves.</p>\n<p>But it's not enough to just talk about it, you have to lead by example, and that's exactly what we did: We teamed up with <a href=\"https://hoprnet.org/\">HOPR</a> to organize the first UX hackathon in the history of web3. Here’s how it went.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4BURqxSIRs506tYIxO4hm/636064d4fe78b84a5500dc1f7d263cbc/hackathon_team_pic.jpeg\" alt=\"hackathon team pic\"></p>\n<h3>The ETH Zurich Hackathon</h3>\n<p>We gathered more than thirty designers onsite and remotely at ETH Zurich to tackle <strong>two of the most important challenges in web3: privacy and security.</strong></p>\n<p>Before making the designers' heads crawl with solving complex problems, we kicked off the hackathon with a workshop on privacy and UX in web3 diving into the evolution of the internet and the fundamental pillars of making the experience of using a crypto wallet accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>The main topics focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contextualization and education:</strong> Knowing how to use these powerful tools helps break down the barrier of crypto jargon that is so intimidating to new users</li>\n<li><strong>Embracing transparent design:</strong> Keeping users well informed and safe is important, even if that means adding a little more friction to their experience</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> We are still in the early stage of web3, so now more than ever, UX design has to use mental models and existing patterns from web2, whenever possible, so we can make the experience of buying crypto from a wallet not too different from ordering a burger from a delivery app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the designers warmed up, it was time to introduce the brief of the two challenges they could choose from.</p>\n<h3>MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>The first one focused on MetaMask Snaps. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> is a new way to create web3 end-user experiences, this new tool is to web3 what the iPhone is to cell phones: a before and after in how we build and interact with wallets.</p>\n<p>This is not just a new feature made by MetaMask, it’s a system that allows anyone to build on top of our wallet to expand its capabilities and customize the wallet experience without asking for permission from anyone except the end user. So, with Snaps, users will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go beyond Ethereum and access other blockchains like Bitcoin.</li>\n<li>Make it possible to integrate any scaling solution and make exploring Layer 2s accessible to everyone.</li>\n<li>Enable authentication, privacy, and consent in ways that keep users in control while empowering them with more ways to protect their data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And privacy was precisely the main protagonist of this UX hackathon and a prevailing pillar in our ecosystem. Web3 technology is still in its early stages and there aren’t widely adopted standards for storing or accessing data yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hoprnet.org/\">HOPR</a> is a Swiss project that aims to improve the privacy and security of web3 transactions by obscuring all metadata, including IP addresses, making it impossible to tell anything about who is sending data or what data they’re sending. And how can they bring this to regular users without making them run their own nodes? By creating a HOPR Snap to bring an extra layer of privacy and security to user’s transactions. This challenge’s brief focused on designing the integration of Snaps into the Metamask Extension’s UI, the installation of the HOPR Snap and a send flow using the Snap.</p>\n<p>The winners of this challenge have weighed in on different solutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NayatCheikh\">Nayat Cheikh</a>: Lead Product Designer at Vesper, designed a scenario in line with how Snaps would work today by downloading the HOPR Snap from their website and a more idealistic user experience scenario—the Snap could be downloaded directly from the MM extension, onboarding users on Snaps as well as thinking about the user flow of how to send a transaction once the Snap is installed in both cases when the user has funds to pay the transaction fee and when they don’t.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52FfXP1P2Q86ZEheHg7ib6/b4680b622ee91f908ae9065024bcf59a/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.30.26_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.30.26 AM\"></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IDfBAffJ8Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/freberghmans?lang=en\">Frederic Berghman</a>: Digital customer experience lead at Bitcoin Suisse, stepped out of his comfort zone as a designer to remind us that UX is not just about designing interfaces but also about thinking about how to bring real value to users. His solution goes beyond the installation of the Snap in the extension, and evolved into a business model of the product that includes insurance for users of the HOPR snap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6AD8mDHuhV33uayVjpgtC9/aa6ac6322cddf05900ae49d03411722b/Frederick.jpg\" alt=\"Frederick\"></p>\n<h3>Social Recovery</h3>\n<p>The second challenge was focused on introducing Social Recovery to MetaMask to help reduce the blockage of funds on the blockchain when users forget their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). This feature would make newcomers feel more secure in a decentralized environment where not everyone wants to have the responsibility of their wallet’s safety. Unlike a traditional self custodial wallet where only you can recover access to your funds via your Secret Recovery Phrase, Social Recovery would allow users to still be the only ones to access to their funds while letting them choose a trusted group of people who can help them recover their wallet if access is lost. This solution to key management would help us onboard more users to DeFi while adding an extra layer of security to their experience, which makes it an exciting UX challenge to explore.</p>\n<p>The winners of this challenge have introduced this feature consciously during the onboarding flow without adding cognitive load or making the experience too long for users, allowing them to rely on the people they already trust to start their crypto journey with confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Sanmartin</strong>: UX researcher and designer at Akasha Foundation,  went further by thinking not only of creating a flow to allow adding guardians during the onboarding to help recover the user's account, but thought of introducing the feature even when the user has already made the onboarding, allowing users to request their contacts to be their guardians or request to be guardian of other accounts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4DSWO82OtJD6ucDX8dxqLt/b7bea43f2ac7462c68711995438b6430/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.39.32_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.39.32 AM\"></p>\n<p><strong>Sinlin Yeo</strong>: Head of Product Design at web3Auth, thought of a flow straight forward and well contextualized both guard creation and recovery request using patterns that users new to web3 may find familiar from web2 products. Her approach is a good reminder that, in the vast majority of cases, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3rD6oYCvnHYaYK8xSJRmxc/03909bfbfabddb5ea026d1afe26c3a28/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.40.28_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.40.28 AM\"></p>\n<h3>The Future of Crypto Is All About UX</h3>\n<p>Web2 products have raised the bar of user experience design, our users are expecting to have intuitive and easy-to-use products, but web3 still has 99 problems and UX is one of them. Our products are still complex and intimidating to use.

As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Invisible Keys Snap</h3>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>Externally-owned accounts are at the core of virtually every dapp or service in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, it is far from trivial to design and implement a wallet application that is both secure and easy to use. Typically, in order to provide full control to the user and high levels of security, we end up resorting to complex and unpractical mechanisms. On the other hand, straightforward and enjoyable user experience is only achieved by asking users to surrend control over their keys.</p>\n<p>With InvisibleKeys, we built on MetaMask’s renowned user experience to propose a new compromise between user experience and security allowing MetaMask to connect to an innovative external multi-cloud wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong>? <strong>InvisibleKeys’ multi-cloud wallet stores the user’s private keys in two or more cloud storage services (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc) in such a way that even if one of these services is compromised the keys never are.</strong> This multi-cloud approach follows a patented workflow (patent US20190095628), which ensures very high levels of security while allowing multi-device synchronisation.</p>\n<p>To import an account from the cloud, MetaMask reads a JSON file in your Google Drive (or any other storage service) with an array of your public keys. Then, to sign a transaction, your private key (PK) is temporarily and locally reconstructed at an external web app that receives MetaMask’s requests for signature, signs the transaction, and returns the signed transaction to MetaMask. The keys are never persisted and only exist temporarily in memory. In addition, to preserve full user control, the PK is never accessed by the MetaMask extension. Even if the wallet is unlocked or compromised, the PK cannot be stolen.</p>\n<p>InvisibleKeys allows users to access their wallet from anywhere in the world, as everything is stored in the cloud, complementing the traditional MetaMask approach and maintaining MetaMask’s high standards for usability and UI interface.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>InvisibleKeys works with two main components: the MetaMask wallet and the external web app.</p>\n<p>As we intend to sign the transaction outside of the wallet, we took advantage of the hardware wallet connection/signing part of the code. Instead of sending the transaction to be signed to a specific hardware, a popup is opened with our web app where the signing will be executed.</p>\n<p>In the web app, the user authenticates with its cloud credentials, the private key is retrieved, the transaction is signed and the key is erased from memory. Finally, the popup is closed and the user is back to the MetaMask wallet which was in a waiting state, expecting a signed transaction to be sent.</p>\n<p>The two components communicate through the browser’s window web API. This is enough in this context since no private information is ever exchanged between the two.</p>\n<h3>UI Changes</h3>\n<p>Firstly, we had to make some UI changes to MetaMask to add our InvisibleKeys connection strategy. It is added the same way a new supported hardware wallet would be added to the app.</p>\n<p>These are some of the changes made to the code. Added a new device and type, and the new button for the UI.</p>\n<p><code>app/scripts/metamask-controller.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>keyringName = InvisibleKeyring.type;\nbreak;\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ui/pages/create-account/connect-hardware/select-hardware.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>  renderConnectToInvisibleButton() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;button\n        className={classnames('hw-connect__btn', {\n          selected: this.state.selectedDevice === 'invisible',\n        })}\n        onClick={(_) => this.setState({ selectedDevice: 'invisible' })}\n      >\n        &#x3C;img\n          className=\"hw-connect__btn__img\"\n          src=\"images/invisible-logo.png\"\n          alt=\"Invisible\"\n        />\n      &#x3C;/button>\n    );\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Invisible Keys Keyring</h3>\n<p>To connect different hardware wallets, the Keyring class acts as an interface to communicate between the wallet and the brand’s device. The main methods needed to import accounts and sign transactions are: <code>addAccounts()</code> which returns an array of addresses, and <code>signTransaction()</code>, which returns a signed transaction.</p>\n<p>We’ve implemented these methods on <code>InvisibleKeyring</code>. The first one opens the popup and expects a message with an array of addresses. The second one opens the popup with the unsigned transaction encoded in a message. Then, expects an encoded signed transaction, which will be returned and the main controller will send. When waiting for the closure of the popup, the Metamask is in a loading state.</p>\n<p>These methods make calls to a different class <code>InvisibleConnect</code> which is responsible for the web app connection and communication.</p>\n<p><code>./InvisibleConnect.js</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default class InvisibleConnect {\n\n  {...}\n\n  const appUrl = 'http://url-to-web-app';\n\n  async getAccountsCloud() {\n    let newAccounts = []\n\n    //create a listener for the imported accounts\n    window.addEventListener(\n      'message',\n      event => {\n        if (event.data.event_id === 'imported_accounts') {\n          newAccounts = event.data.accounts\n        }\n      },\n      false,\n    )\n\n    return new Promise(async resolve => {\n      const child = window.open(appUrl + '/import')\n      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        if (child.closed) {\n          //when the popup is closed\n          clearInterval(interval)\n          this.accounts = newAccounts\n          resolve(newAccounts)\n        }\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  }\n\n  async signTxCloud(transaction) {\n    let signedTx = {}\n\n    //create a listener for the signedTx\n    window.addEventListener(\n      'message',\n      event => {\n        if (event.data.event_id === 'signedTx') {\n          signedTx = {\n            v: event.data.v,\n            r: event.data.r,\n            s: event.data.s,\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      false,\n    )\n\n    return new Promise(async resolve => {\n      const child = window.open(appUrl + '/sign') //open popup\n\n      child.postMessage(\n        //sends message to the popup\n        {\n          event_id: 'unsignedTx',\n          data: {\n            tx: transaction.serialize().toString('hex'),\n          },\n        },\n        '*',\n      )\n\n      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        if (child.closed) {\n          //when the popup is closed\n          clearInterval(interval)\n          resolve(signedTx)\n        }\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  }\n}\n./eth-invisible-keyring.js\n\nimport InvisibleConnect from './InvisibleConnect'\n\nclass InvisibleKeyring extends EventEmitter {\n\n  {...}\n\n  addAccounts(n = 1) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      this.unlock()\n        .then(async _ => {\n          const from = this.unlockedAccount\n          const to = from + n\n          this.accounts = []\n\n          for (let i = from; i &#x3C; to; i++) {\n            const address = InvisibleConnect.getAccounts(i).address\n\n            this.accounts.push(address)\n            this.accountIndexes[ethUtil.toChecksumAddress(address)] = i\n            this.page = 0\n          }\n          resolve(this.accounts) //resolve the new accounts\n        })\n        .catch(e => {\n          reject(e)\n        })\n    })\n  }\n\n  signTransaction(address, tx) {\n    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {\n      try {\n        const signedTx = await InvisibleConnect.signTxCloud(tx)\n        const txData = tx.toJSON()\n        txData.v = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.v)\n        txData.r = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.r)\n        txData.s = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.s)\n\n        const common = tx.common\n        const freeze = Object.isFrozen(tx)\n        const feeMarketTransaction = FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction.fromTxData(\n          txData,\n          {common, freeze},\n        )\n        resolve(feeMarketTransaction)\n      } catch (err) {\n        reject(new Error(err))\n      }\n    })\n  }\n\n   {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>External App</h3>\n<p>The app has two pages: one where the accounts are imported and the other where the transaction is signed.</p>\n<p>In the first one, the user authenticates to google drive where a file with its public keys is stored in <code>metamask/public.json</code>. Then, after clicking the import button, the file is fetched, and the keys are read and sent through the window web API to the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const sendAccountsToMetamask = (publicKeys: Address[]) => {\n\twindow.opener.postMessage(\n\t  {\n\t    event_id: 'importAccounts',\n\t    data: {\n\t      accounts: publicKeys,\n\t    },\n\t  },\n\t  '*'\n\t);\n};\n\nconst getPublicKeys = async (): void => {\n     const publicKeys: Address[] = await getGoogleDrivePublicKeys();\n     sendAccountsToMetamask(publicKeys);\n     return;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the second one, the user has to authenticate to both Google Drive and Dropbox, which were the services we used for this example. The approach is compatible with any storage service. The requirement being that they are non-colluding, independent services. After authentication, the different parts of information are retrieved from those services and the private key is reconstructed using the <code>decrypt()</code> method, which is implemented according to the mechanism described in the aformentioned patent, and the transaction is signed. Immediately after that, the private key is erased from memory. Finally, the signed transaction is sent back to the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<p>Here is the code step by step. Only relevant parts of the code are shown. Everything related to the UI state or API communication is omitted.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const sendTxToMetamask = (v, r, s) => {\n\twindow.opener.postMessage(\n\t  {\n\t    event_id: 'signedTx',\n\t    data: {\n\t      v: v,\n\t      r: r,\n\t      s: s,\n\t    },\n\t  },\n\t  '*'\n\t);\n};\n\nconst signTransaction = async (): void => {\n     const trs = TransactionFactory.fromSerializedData(Buffer.from(tx, 'hex'));\n     const googleDrivePart = await getGoogleDrivePart();\n     const dropboxPart = await getDropboxPart();\n\n     const piecesArray = [\n         Buffer.from(googleDrivePart, 'hex'), \n         Buffer.from(dropboxPart, 'hex')\n     ];\n     const decrypted = decrypt({ data: piecesArray });\n     let plainTextPK = Buffer.from(\n         new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted.data),\n         'hex'\n     );\n\n     if (!ethUtil.isValidPrivate(plainTextPK)) {\n        alert('Failed to decrypt Private Key');\n        return;\n     }\n\n     const signedTx = trs.sign(plainTextPK);\n     plainTextPK = null; //erase from memory\n\n     const v = ethUtil.stripHexPrefix(ethUtil.bufferToHex(signed_tx.v));\n     const r = ethUtil.stripHexPrefix(ethUtil.bufferToHex(signed_tx.r));\n     const s = ethUtil.stripHexPrefix(ethUtil.bufferToHex(signed_tx.s));\n\n     if (signed_tx.verifySignature()) {\n         sendTxToMetamask(v, r, s);\n     } else {\n         alert('Signature failed');\n     }\n    return;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are a emthusiastic team of software engineers based in Braga, Portugal, with strong background on distributed systems.

We also expect some apps like heyanon and stealthdrop to integrate it upon release, and hope that more folks will use it!</p>\n<p>We also want to write an ERC to standardize what we found so that wallets like MetaMask and Ledger can integrate it into their core libraries.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>yush_g is exploring next gen ZK identity with Personae Labs and helped write the original paper, and Piotr is a wicked engineer with a passion for new wallet primitives and cutting edge zero knowledge advances.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Piotr initially learned about MetaMask Snaps in Osaka Devcon, and has been working with them since then. Aayush was just introduced to MetaMask Snaps this Devcon by Piotr.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>Arbitrary WASM inside a wallet is currently quite nascent, and we are excited to get to try it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Development is fairly smooth and efficient. There are still some difficulties with deployment, since users have to disable their regular MetaMask to be able to use MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is an interesting new wallet primitive, and great to be able to quickly prototype new cryptographic ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>We think the ability to roll your own cryptography is powerful: for instance, our project, which deploys verifiably deterministic signatures on Ethereum, will unlock things like being able to uniquely vote within any anonymity set you can dream of, anonymous airdrops to unlinked accounts, or threads where you can repeatedly post under the same anonymous name.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>We designed our snap to run arbitrary WASM so we could just plug in our existing Rust code -- we recommend looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/s-a-malik/blackbelt\">our code</a> if you're interested in doing the same!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the Snap is a server and the website is the client.</p>\n<p>Website has following user-flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect your EOA and install the Smart account session Snap.</li>\n<li>Enable Smart Account on top of MetaMask address. MetaMask EOA will be controller of this Smart account.</li>\n<li>Enable Session Module on your Smart Account. Modules enable additional access-control logic for your Smart Safe account. Essentially, every Smart account is controlled by two means. By the MetaMask account owner using their signer keys and by optional modules that have their own custom access logic.</li>\n<li>Create a session.</li>\n<li>This will create a temporary session keys on your smart account that are authorized to transaction on your wallet via module. Session can have parameters like startTime, endTime and Permissions for custom actions on Dapp contracts.</li>\n<li>Send auto approved transactions using above session key without MetaMask pop-up for gas or signatures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Metamask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#restricted-methods\">API calls</a>, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user.</p>\n<p>In this case we have levarged below:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MetaMask.
