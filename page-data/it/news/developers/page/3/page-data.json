Okonkwo","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"kingsley-okonkwo"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has been at the forefront of innovation since the dawn of Ethereum, pioneering web3 wallet industry standards and seeking new ways for dapps and protocols to build new experiences and improve web3 UX to onboard the next generation of adopters.</p>\n<p>Today, web3 is considered too complex for the average internet user. There are too many steps a developer must consider for their users before launching a dapp or a protocol. For example, users must first download a browser extension or mobile wallet, generate a wallet address, and write down seed phrases before connecting to a dapp. Additionally, to make a simple transaction such as buying a token, users must confirm pop-ups for every interaction, figure out how to pay for gas fees, and ensure they’re signing the correct transaction. This user experience is simply not streamlined enough for the average person.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine abstracting all this friction and complexity away and enabling users to get started to use dapps with only a few clicks and no installations. This is exactly what the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit enables.</p>\n<h2>Introducing the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Today, the team is excited to announce the gated alpha launch of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit, our smart contract account offering powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/metamask/delegation-framework\">Delegation Framework</a>. Built upon years of research within MetaMask, the Delegation Toolkit offers an innovative approach to building embedded wallet experiences directly into your dapp.</p>\n<p>The toolkit leverages the power of delegations to empower dapps and protocols to offer more user-friendly experiences in web3 through permission settings and capability sharing. The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is currently available on any EVM chain supported by a User Operation Bundler, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Linea, Optimism, and Polygon.</p>\n<h2>Unique features of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The Delegation Toolkit stands out from existing smart wallet offerings because of our permissions-first, consent-based communication approach between dapps and wallets, enabled by the <a href=\"https://github.com/metamask/delegation-framework/\">Delegation Framework</a>. The Delegation Framework, unique to the Delegation Toolkit, is a set of comprehensively audited, open source and extensible smart contracts that collectively manage the delegation lifecycle, from delegator account creation to caveat enforcement, delegation storage, and redemption.</p>\n<p>Delegation, in this context, refers to the ability of an account owner (the delegator) to grant permission to another smart contract account or externally owned account (the delegate) to perform specific actions on the delegator's behalf. The delegator can apply rules and restrictions, also known as caveats, to delegations, describing what actions the delegate can perform and to what extent. For example, Alice delegates the ability to spend her USDC to Bob, limiting the amount of spendable USDC to 100. Bob can also redelegate permissions that have been delegated to him, creating a chain of delegations across trusted parties.</p>\n<p>This approach emphasizes permissions over confirmations, allowing users to craft customizable and modular permissions that enable dapps to streamline routine web3 operations like signing confirmations or reducing the number of dapp to wallet switches with an entirely embedded web3 experience. These permissions can also be used by dapps to carry out operations on the user’s behalf, even when the user is not connected to the dapp.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/X3XdMDJiHHDE6K3TL1hCX/03a33c66d0b7da6e1c1017baafd4e3b9/Introducing_the_Delegation_Toolkit-_MetaMask_Smart_Account_Offering_2__1_.png\" alt=\"Image red ballon\"></p>\n<h2>How the Delegation Toolkit improves common web3 activities</h2>\n<br />\n<p>MetaMask Delegation Toolkit allows developers to build seamless, elegant web3 experiences and create innovative use cases never seen before. Here are some ways it improves common day-to-day web3 activities for users and developers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Simplified onboarding process</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit allows developers to build a user flow that bypasses the typical web3 wallet connection flow, meaning no extension wallet or mobile app is required. Users will not have to worry about seed phrases or confirmation screens when they get started out in web3. Dapps can now offer flexible authentication methods such as passkeys, EOA signers, social logins, and email logins to quickly onboard users according to their security preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Unlock new web3 experiences</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit enables new capabilities previously unattainable in web3 by enabling large-scale peer-to-peer social coordination with incentive structures that do not require users to connect their accounts to your dapp. This open-sourced, modular, and backward-compatible toolkit allows you to customize and enhance your dapp for viral growth, enabling new user experiences such as recurring subscription payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal in-dapp user interruptions</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit allows developers to eliminate repetitive confirmations, pop-ups, and dapp-to-wallet switches. Developers can now abstract away gas fees for their users by covering the cost or assigning them to a third party while automating precisely how many clicks users take.</li>\n<li><strong>Build for the largest and most active web3 user base</strong>: With MetaMask’s millions of monthly active users, you can onboard new users to your dapp with minimal friction while continuing to create user-friendly and feature-rich experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplify your smart contract development process</strong>: Eliminate the need for custom delegation code in your contract. Let our flexible and general-purpose framework handle the complexities, allowing you to focus on your dapp's core logic and achieve up to a 95% reduction in smart contract code.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Sign up for the preview</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is still in gated alpha, so access is limited.

In 9 months since the launch, we’ve seen 55 Snaps developed by 3rd party developers, listed in our <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/\">official directory</a>, and over 900k installs across all Snaps.</p>\n<p>As we continue to find ways to make building Snaps and extending MetaMask more seamless for developers, we’ve identified 2 key areas and have shipped some important new updates, which we’ll discuss further in this blog post.</p>\n<h2>1. Reduced audit requirements for allow-listing in the Snaps directory</h2>\n<br />\nPublishing a third-party Snap just got simpler. Before now, developers needed to complete an audit before submitting any Snap to the allowlist to be included in the Snaps registry. Today, we’re relaxing this rule so that Snaps that do not do key management( [entropy API](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip32entropy)) can now be submitted to the allowlist without a security audit and distributed through our channel.  \n<p>It is important to note that we will still require third-party security audits for Snaps that do key management. Key management or entropy APIs are those APIs that are used to manage blockchain accounts on the user’s behalf. Such APIs includes <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip32entropy\">snap_getBip32Entropy</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip44entropy\">snap_getBip44Entropy</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getentropy\">snap_getEntropy</a>. If you use these APIs and want to learn how to prepare your Snap for a third-party security audit, check out this blog on <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/5-security-audit-tips-from-msq-snap-and-consensys-diligence/\">5 Security Audit Tips from MSQ Snap and Consensys Diligence</a>.</p>\n<p>As of today, allow-listing is still a manual process. We check if a Snap needs an audit when submitted for the allowlist, and if not, we will proceed with submitting it to the registry. All Snaps require two approvals from the Snaps team before they can be allowed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a subset of third-party Snaps can now be installed by anyone without inclusion on our allowlist permissionlessly. Snaps that rely only on “open” permissions from the following list do not need to be allow-listed before they can be installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>endowment:cronjob</li>\n<li>endowment:ethereum-provider</li>\n<li>endowment:lifecycle-hooks</li>\n<li>endowment:page-home</li>\n<li>endowment:signature-insight</li>\n<li>endowment:transaction-insight</li>\n<li>snap_dialog</li>\n<li>snap_getLocale</li>\n<li>snap_manageState</li>\n<li>Snap_notify</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We still encourage developers to get third-party security audits for their Snaps even if not required for allowlisting. Also, allow-listing is still required for Snaps to appear in the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io\">Snaps Directory</a>.</p>\n<h2>2. Seamless auto-connection for selected dapps</h2>\n<br />\nDevelopers can now specify a list of dapps with auto-connection privileges with their Snap. This means that for specific dapps, when the dapp calls `wallet_requestSnaps`, users would no longer need to confirm a connection manually, and the dapp can check if the Snap is installed seamlessly. This is especially useful for Snaps that are used by multiple dapps as it allows for the following UX flow:\n<ul>\n<li>You build a Snap for use by one or more dapps and authorize an automatic connection to your Snap's companion dapp by listing it in the <code>initialConnections</code> configuration option.</li>\n<li>A user installs your Snap while interacting with a dapp that uses it.</li>\n<li>The user lands on your Snap's companion dapp.</li>\n<li>Your companion dapp can immediately identify that the Snap has already been installed.</li>\n<li>The user can interact with the companion dapp without connecting to the Snap manually.</li>\n<li>This can be extended to your trusted known dapps of choice that integrates your Snap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/linea-voyager-snap\">Linea Voyager Snap</a> currently uses this feature, and you can see the seamless connection by installing the Linea Voyager Snap from the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/consensys/linea-voyager/\">Snaps Directory</a> and visiting the <a href=\"https://voyager-snap.linea.build/\">Linea Voyager companion dapp</a>. Unlike most companion dapps, this one automatically connects to the Snap, even though you did not install it or connect it manually from the dapp. See the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/how-to/allow-automatic-connections/\">Snaps documentation</a> for detailed information on how to use this feature.</p>\n<h2>Keep building with MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<br />\nAs we continue to build the permissionless future for web3 wallets, we’re constantly working on improving the experience, and these two new updates are some of what we have in the pipeline. \n<p>If you’re currently building with Snaps, we’d like to know what you think, so <a href=\"https://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/64f99fe2b12d6940df7c0357?utm_source=ownedmedia&#x26;utm_medium=landing-page&#x26;utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_awareness_content\">leave us feedback </a>as it helps us build a better wallet for tomorrow.

An external party wants you to sell your vote, in other words, they want you to vote for their choice, not your own, in exchange for some incentives. They will need proof of your vote if you succumb to their demand—often through a blockchain transaction receipt. While this might seem like an excellent opportunity if you're inclined to sell your vote, it undermines the integrity of the entire voting process.</p>\n<p>How can we enable voters to vote for their preferred candidates or issues while concealing their choices so that no one else can see them? The answer lies in one word: <strong>Encryption</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to develop a simple voting application—Privote—that utilizes encryption on the blockchain. When the time arrives, the votes are decrypted and tallied, and the results are published back to the blockchain while maintaining the voters' anonymity. The results are verified through a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof. Although not perfect, this example illustrates the underlying concepts.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Vitalik Buterin's <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html\">blog post</a> for an in-depth understanding of blockchain voting.</p>\n<p>Before we proceed, here is a breakdown of the main components of the Privote dapp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smart Contract</strong>: This system stores multiple votes (ballots) and related data such as titles, available choices, and encrypted data.</li>\n<li><strong>Trusted Party</strong>: An off-chain server that decrypts the votes, calculates the results and publishes them on the blockchain. This server is termed the \"Trusted Party\" for a reason: it cannot publish incorrect results, either by computing inaccurately or by censoring messages.</li>\n<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: A platform where users connect their wallets and submit votes. There will also be a separate page for the \"admin\" to view the number of votes cast and manually release the results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To successfully build out Privote, we need to address two challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable any voter to encrypt their vote while allowing the trusted party to decrypt it?</li>\n<li>Ensure the trusted party is reliable and can provide a ZK proof of the calculation, but what exactly are we proving?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenge 1: Enable any voter to encrypt their vote while allowing the trusted party to decrypt it</h2>\n<br />\nTo solve this, we can adopt asymmetric encryption. Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt. Multiple asymmetric encryption algorithms exist, including ElGamal, RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve techniques. For this tutorial, we’ll use the elliptic curve techniques, specifically the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://www.upguard.com/blog/diffie-hellman)(ECDH).\n<p>In ECDH, both the trusted party and each voter have their own key pairs (a public key and a private key), and the choice of elliptic curve, such as the <code>Baby Jubjub</code> curve used here for its suitability in zero-knowledge proofs, impacts the security and efficiency of cryptographic operations; the <code>Baby Jubjub</code> curve is defined by the equation <code>y^2 = x^3 + 168698 x 2 + x</code>, and key pairs are generated as specific pairs of points on this curve:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import {\n  packPoint,\n  unpackPoint,\n  mulPointEscalar,\n  Point,\n} from \"@zk-kit/baby-jubjub\";\nimport crypto from \"crypto\";\n\n// generates babyjubjub key pair that is compatible with our zokrates implementation\n\nexport const generateKeyPair = () => {\n// X and Y coordinates of the base point \n  const Base8: Point&#x3C;bigint> = [\n    16540640123574156134436876038791482806971768689494387082833631921987005038935n,\n    20819045374670962167435360035096875258406992893633759881276124905556507972311n,\n  ];\n\n  const privateKey = BigInt(`0x${crypto.randomBytes(32).toString(\"hex\")}`);\n\n  const publicKey = packPoint(mulPointEscalar(Base8, privateKey));\n\n  return {\n    privateKey,\n    publicKey,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the <code>generateKeyPair</code> function, I first create a secure random private key and then calculate the corresponding public key by performing a specific mathematical operation (scalar multiplication) on a predefined point on the curve, often called a base point or generator point. In the code, this point is named Base8. The result of this multiplication is another point on the curve, denoted by its X and Y coordinates. Subsequently, the point is formatted into a bigint for convenient use with the packPoint function.</p>\n<h3>Voting with decrypted choice</h3>\n<p>The voter creates a cipher by combining their private key with the trusted party's public key. This cipher is used to encrypt the vote. The smart contract then saves the encrypted vote and the voter's public key together.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export const encryptVote = async (vote: string) => {\n  const { publicKey: trustedPartypublicKey } = config;\n  const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPair();\n  const encryptedVote = await encryptData(\n    vote,\n    privateKey,\n    publicKey,\n    BigInt(trustedPartypublicKey)\n  );\n\n  return {\n    encryptedVote,\n    publicKey: publicKey.toString(),\n  };\n};\n\nexport const encryptData = (\n  data: string,\n  privateKey: bigint,\n  voterPublicKey: bigint,\n  trustedPartyKey: bigint\n) => {\n  // Compute the shared secret by multiplying the trusted party's public key by the private key.\n  const unpackedKey = unpackPoint(trustedPartyKey);\n  if (!unpackedKey) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid key\");\n  }\n  const sharedSecretPoint = mulPointEscalar(unpackedKey, privateKey);\n\n  let sharedSecret = sharedSecretPoint[0].toString(16);\n\n  // Pad the shared secret with zeros to make it 32 bytes long.\n  while (sharedSecret.length &#x3C; 64) {\n    sharedSecret = \"0\" + sharedSecret;\n  }\n\n  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(\n    \"aes-256-ctr\",\n    Buffer.from(sharedSecret, \"hex\"), // Use the first 32 bytes of the shared secret as the key.\n    Buffer.alloc(16, 0) // Use a zero-filled buffer as the IV.\n  );\n  let encrypted = cipher.update(data, \"utf8\", \"hex\");\n  encrypted += cipher.final(\"hex\");\n\n  return encrypted;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Decrypting votes and calculating results</h3>\n<p>The trusted party can create a cipher using their private key and each voter's public key to decrypt the data.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export const publishResults = async (id: number) => {\n\t.....\n\t.....\n\n  const decryptedVotes = votes.map((vote) => {\n    const { encryptedVote, voter } = vote;\n    return decryptVote(encryptedVote, voter);\n  });\n\n  const results = calculateResult(decryptedVotes);\n// next send the calculate results to the blockchain with the zk proof \n\t ......\n\t ......\n};\n\nexport const decryptVote = (encryptedVote: string, voterPublicKey: string) => {\n  const { privateKey } = config;\n  const decryptedVote = decryptData(\n    encryptedVote,\n    BigInt(privateKey),\n    BigInt(voterPublicKey)\n  );\n\n  return decryptedVote;\n};\n\nexport const decryptData = (\n  encryptedData: string,\n  privateKey: bigint,\n  trustedPartyPublicKey: bigint\n) => {\n  const unpackedKey = unpackPoint(trustedPartyPublicKey);\n  if (!unpackedKey) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid key\");\n  }\n\n  const sharedSecretPoint = mulPointEscalar(unpackedKey, privateKey);\n\n  let sharedSecret = sharedSecretPoint[0].toString(16);\n\n  // Pad the shared secret with zeros to make it 32 bytes long.\n  while (sharedSecret.length &#x3C; 64) {\n    sharedSecret = \"0\" + sharedSecret;\n  }\n\n  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(\n    \"aes-256-ctr\",\n    Buffer.from(sharedSecret, \"hex\"), // Use the first 32 bytes of the shared secret as the key.\n    Buffer.alloc(16, 0) // Use a zero-filled buffer as the IV.\n  );\n  let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedData, \"hex\", \"utf8\");\n  decrypted += decipher.final(\"utf8\");\n  return decrypted;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the <code>generateKeyPair</code> function, we formatted the public key for easy use with the packPoint function. In the above code, with <code>unpackPoint</code>, we convert it back to its original form because we need to create a shared secret by combining the private key and the voter's public key. The shared secret is used to decrypt the vote.</p>\n<p>After decrypting each vote, calculating the results is easy! Just loop through the votes array and accumulate votes for a given choice.</p>\n<h2>Challenge 2: Ensure the trusted party is reliable and can provide ZK proof of the calculation. But what exactly are we proving?</h2>\n<br />\nIf you're unfamiliar with ZK proofs, they are a fairly complex yet fascinating piece of technology. ZK proofs are a method whereby one party can prove to another that they know a value without revealing any information about the value itself. Essentially, it's a way to validate the truth of something without sharing the details. Moreover, anyone can verify whether that proof is correct.\n<p>For our application, ideally, the trusted party should prove that they can take the encrypted votes, decrypt them, and calculate the number of votes each choice has received. In this case, the “secret” key is the trusted party's private key. For the sake of simplicity, we are just proving the ownership of a private key that matches the public key committed in the smart contract. As mentioned earlier, the votes use that key to generate a cipher to encrypt the vote.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, we’ll use <a href=\"https://zokrates.github.io/introduction.html\">ZoKrates</a>, a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum. It helps you utilize verifiable computation in your dapp, from specifying your program in a high-level language to generating proofs of computation and verifying those proofs in Solidity.</p>\n<p>This is the simple ZK program I use:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Python\">import \"ecc/proofOfOwnership\" as proofOfOwnership;\nfrom \"ecc/babyjubjubParams\" import BabyJubJubParams;\n\ndef main(field[2] pk, private field sk, BabyJubJubParams context) -> bool {\n  bool resp = proofOfOwnership(pk, sk,context);\n  return resp;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see in the arguments list, pk is a public argument, and sk is a private argument. context is also public. Only the prover - the trusted party, knows the sk, but the pk is known to anyone as it is in the smart contract. <code>context</code> is the parameters related to the curve we have picked to generate a key pair.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { initialize } from \"zokrates-js\";\n\nexport const generateProof = async (\n  privateKey: string,\n  publicKey: string[]\n) => {\n\n  const provider = await initialize();\n\n  const artifacts = await getZKP();\n\n  const program = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from(artifacts.program, \"hex\"));\n\n  const { witness, output } = provider.computeWitness(program, [\n    ...publicKey.flat(),\n    privateKey,\n    \"8\",\n    \"168700\",\n    \"168696\",\n    \"168698\",\n    \"1\",\n    \"0\",\n    \"1\",\n  \"16540640123574156134436876038791482806971768689494387082833631921987005038935\",\n    \"20819045374670962167435360035096875258406992893633759881276124905556507972311\",\n  ]);\n\n  const provingKey = Uint8Array.from(\n    Buffer.from(artifacts.provingKey, \"hex\")\n  );\n\n  const proof = provider.generateProof(\n    program,\n    witness,\n    provingKey\n  );\n\n  return provider.utils.formatProof(proof)\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above snippet, I am using the ZoKrates JS SDK to generate a proof. The flow is similar to what is documented in the <a href=\"https://zokrates.github.io/introduction.html\">ZoKrates documentation</a>. Our goal is to use the ZoKrates program to generate a proof, so we’re passing three arguments to the computeWitness function: pk (a public argument), sk (a private argument), and context. These are used to create a witness, which is then used to generate proof.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering about this part of the argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">\"8\",\n    \"168700\",\n    \"168696\",\n    \"168698\",\n    \"1\",\n    \"0\",\n    \"1\",\n  \"16540640123574156134436876038791482806971768689494387082833631921987005038935\",\n    \"20819045374670962167435360035096875258406992893633759881276124905556507972311\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>context</code> provides the data related to the specific <code>Baby JubJub</code> curve we've been using throughout the application, as many curve variations can be used. Files such as the verification key, proving key and ZoKrates program are kept in a separate directory. I am using the function below to get those:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">const getZKP = async () => {\n  const zkPath = path.join(process.cwd(), \"src\", \"services\", \"zkp\");\n  const program = (await readFile(path.join(zkPath, \"./out\"))).toString(\"hex\");\n  const verificationKey = JSON.parse(\n    (await readFile(path.join(zkPath, \"./verification.key\"))).toString()\n  );\n  const provingKey = (\n    await readFile(path.join(zkPath, \"./proving.key\"))\n  ).toString(\"hex\");\n\n  return {\n    program,\n    provingKey,\n    verificationKey,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The snippet below is from the contract in which the contract accepts the results calculated by the trusted party. Only if the verification is successful does the contract accept the result. Outsiders can verify this by passing the pk (which is public and found in the contract) and the proof to the verifier function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bool\" data-meta=\"isVerified = verifyTx(proof, input);\">        if (!isVerified) {\n            revert(\"Invalid proof\");\n        }\n\n     // accept results\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>In this blog, we developed Privote, a ZK-based private voting system that keeps voters' choices confidential until the voting period ends. We used elliptic curve techniques to encrypt votes and demonstrated how to decrypt and tally them securely. We also implemented zero-knowledge proofs using ZoKrates to verify the voting process's integrity without revealing private information.</p>\n<p>This tutorial provides a basic understanding of creating secure and private voting systems on the blockchain. In the second part, we’ll build out the frontend and show you how users can connect and cast votes using the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/sdk/\">MetaMask SDK</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"it","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Sviluppatori","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"Coding a ZK Proof-Based Private Multi-Choice Voting Dapp","metaDescription":"In this tutorial, we implement a ZK-based private voting system, Privote, in which no one can see the voters' choices until the voting has ended","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/it/news/developers/page/3/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/security/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":8,"categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","category":"developers","totalItems":66,"currentPage":3,"totalPages":17,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"non è supportato.
