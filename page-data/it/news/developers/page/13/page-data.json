A user, when trying to make payments, can end up paying much more than required. Short time high traffic on the blockchain can lead to a huge impact in gas prices. Although L2s were built to reduce gas prices, we sometimes need a more general and easier solution than using an L2 for transaction purposes. We thought it would be useful for users to have an app that can predict future gas prices based on historical data and current trends.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>EtherEyes consists of four parts: Gas price server, the snap, SARIMA Model, web frontend. The gas price server provides data about historical and current gas prices. The website hosts the snap and provides interface to install and interact with the snap by calling snap API methods. We used Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(SARIMA) model to predict gas prices.</p>\n<h4>Gas Price Server</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>We collect live gas price data as a list of around 200 candlesticks (each candlestick is an aggregate of the past 30 minutes of data) using the <a href=\"https://owlracle.info/eth\">Owlracle API</a>. This gives us the timeseries data of past 100 hours of gas prices.</p>\n<h4>The Snap</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>For the snap, we used the transaction insights API to provide realtime gas prices predictions. The flow of the snap is as follows:</p>\n<p>First, when the user starts a transaction, the transaction insights shows up in the confirmation page which is implemented using the onTransactionHandler. Here we show the user about upcoming prediction for next 30 and 60 mins. A simplified version of what we implemented is given here:</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n let state: { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n state = (await wallet.request({\n   method: 'snap_manageState',\n   params: ['get'],\n })) as { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n if (!state) {\n   state = {\n     notifToggle,\n     urgency,\n     lowEth,\n   };\n }\n\n let insights: any = {\n   type: 'Gas Fee estimation',\n };\n\n if (\n   !isObject(transaction) ||\n   !hasProperty(transaction, 'data') ||\n   typeof transaction.data !== 'string'\n ) {\n   console.warn('unknown transaction type');\n   return { insights };\n }\n\n const response = await fetch(`${MODEL_API_ENDPOINT}`, {\n   method: 'get',\n   headers: {\n     'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n   },\n });\n\n const currentData = await fetch(CURRENT_DATA_ENDPOINT, {\n   method: 'get',\n   headers: {\n     'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n   },\n });\n\n if (!response.ok) {\n   throw new Error('API request failed');\n }\n\n const data = await response.json();\n const current = await currentData.json();\n\n state.lowEth = Math.min(data.low_30_minutes, data.low_60_minutes);\n\n await wallet.request({\n   method: 'snap_manageState',\n   params: ['update', state],\n });\n\n insights = {\n   'Average Gas Limit': `Current value: ${current.avgGas}`,\n\n   'Estimated current gas price': `Current value (Base + Priority): ${\n     current.speeds[0].baseFee + current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas\n   } GWei; Base Fee: ${current.speeds[0].baseFee} GWei`,\n\n   'Forecasted Avg Gas price (for the next 30 mins)': `\n   Gas price within 30 minutes is expected to get as low as: ${data.low_30_minutes} GWei`,\n\n   'Forecasted Avg Gas price (for the next 60 mins)': `Gas price within 60 minutes is expected to get as low as: ${Math.min(\n     data.low_30_minutes,\n     data.low_60_minutes,\n   )} GWei`,\n\n   'Expected savings in 30 mins (For average gas limit)': `\n   ${\n     current.avgGas *\n     (current.speeds[0].baseFee +\n       current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas -\n       data.low_30_minutes)\n   } GWei`,\n\n   'Expected savings in 60 mins (For average gas limit)': `${\n     current.avgGas *\n     (current.speeds[0].baseFee +\n       current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas -\n       Math.min(data.low_30_minutes, data.low_60_minutes))\n   } GWei\n   `,\n };\n\n return { insights };\n};\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the user deciedes to wait, he can wait and start a notification system from the website that interacts with the snap via <code>onCronjob</code> handler and sends gas prices after every three minutes as native browser notifications. When the prices get very close to the prediction, it asks the user to complete the transaction.</p>\n<pre><code>\nexport const onCronjob: OnCronjobHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n switch (request.method) {\n   case 'exampleMethodOne': {\n     // get data from state whenever snap is invoked as snaps executions are ephemeral\n     let state: { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n     state = (await wallet.request({\n       method: 'snap_manageState',\n       params: ['get'],\n     })) as { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n     if (!state) {\n       state = {\n         notifToggle,\n         urgency,\n         lowEth,\n       };\n     }\n     notifToggle = state.notifToggle;\n     urgency = state.urgency;\n     lowEth = state.lowEth;\n\n     await wallet.request({\n       method: 'snap_manageState',\n       params: ['update', state],\n     });\n\n     console.log({ notifToggle });\n     if (notifToggle) {\n       const currentData = await fetch(CURRENT_DATA_ENDPOINT, {\n         method: 'get',\n         headers: {\n           'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n         },\n       });\n       const current = await currentData.json();\n       if (Math.abs(current.speeds[0].baseFee - lowEth) &#x3C; urgency / 38) {\n         return wallet.request({\n           method: 'snap_notify',\n           params: [\n             {\n               type: 'native',\n               message: `Gasfee is low!

Another area to improve is the urgency threshold where we need to come up with a more dynamic expression to handle wide variations of market profile, user urgency and transaction gas savings at the same time and quickly arrive at an almost optimal point where the user should make payment. Also we need to make the web interface a bit more user friendly and add some overall error handling at some corner cases which can occur rarely.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are a team consisting of eight BTech engineering students at IIT Patna.

It’s a really unique and interesting add on to MetaMask, and can be used to bring endless customizations in the wallet. The development process is also pretty straightforward and we did not face any major setbacks while developing even though there was less documentation and discussion forum content available. Although it is still in development and lacks few important features as of now,  we can already see the great potential it can have in upcoming years.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is similar to an extension in a web browser. It is used to extend the functionalities of MetaMask. It is safe as the snaps are run in an isolated environment where they have access to a limited set of capabilities determined by the permissions granted by the user during installation. It is a great and safe way to customize your wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s one of the projects that allowed us to witness how different computer science fields could work together to solve a challenge. For my team and I, building this snap was a fantastic learning opportunity. We gained knowledge on how to implement our idea effectively as well as how to use machine learning to solve a problem on blockchain. Along the way, we also established a few new connections. On the other side, rest wallets feel quite restrictive for developers.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Snaps add the features of extensions to a crypto wallet. It is really innovative and can be used for many critical use cases to improve mass adoption of cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Snaps can really be a breakthrough in the web3 ecosystem as it transforms a simple Ethereum wallet to an entire web3 management tool where we can customize and enhance our web3 experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong>\nStart reading the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html\">documentation</a>.

The project is led by some very talented individuals, including Christine Lemmer-Webber and F. Randall (\"Randy\") Farmer. Christine is known as a creator of the ActivityPub protocol (perhaps the most widely used decentralized social network protocol today), and Randy has been working on secure distributed applications since he helped build the first MMO (Lucasfilm’s Habitat).</p>\n<p>Spritely <a href=\"https://spritely.institute/static/papers/spritely-core.html\">builds the foundation</a> for a maximally <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/security/meta-mask-and-laconic-launch-moby-mask-light-client/\">phishing-proof</a> permissionless social network, where interactions are always rooted in consent and social introductions, making it harder for phishers to impersonate people, and easier for people to establish credibility and context-preserving social environments. We believe this is an ambitious and critical piece of infrastructure for allowing a safe permissionless web.</p>\n<p>A Spritely application is not built on blockchains itself, but can interoperate with blockchains as needed for multi-party assurances. By default, users create their own programs, functions, and content and simply share access with each other over the network. Intermediary servers can provide replication, but they can always be routed around and are not necessary.</p>\n<p>Since Spritely applications do not require financial buy-in the way blockchains do, it’s much friendlier to new user adoption, while still allowing a type of permissionless application to be built where it’s rooted in a user’s own sense of trust and safety. Their capability-security approach to permissionless computing makes a lot of sense to us at MetaMask, and we think tools like it can enable exciting kinds of applications.</p>\n<p>As it is a true distributed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1560751433355407360\">object capability (ocap) system</a>, the security model goes all the way down to the syntax of the language, <a href=\"http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html\">which is chosen</a> to ensure it’s as easy as possible to extend programs in a safe way.</p>\n<p>This is similar to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/meta-mask-grants-dao-funds-agoric-and-safeheron-with-first-round-of-grants/\">Agoric’s</a> HardenedJS, which underpins the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a> system, which makes JavaScript secure through the ses-shim and the TC-39 standards process, and was <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/meta-mask-grants-dao-funds-agoric-and-safeheron-with-first-round-of-grants/\">a recent MetaMask grant recipient</a>. While Agoric is oriented at making secure distributed programming maximally accessible to JavaScript programmers via the <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs\">Endo</a> project, Spritely has chosen the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)\">Scheme language</a> (a Lisp dialect) which is less common but is more simple and flexible, and allows more open-ended experimentation and iteration for the platform. The two aspire to interoperate over a protocol called <a href=\"https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html\">CapTP</a>, in a joint project through the <a href=\"https://github.com/ocapn/ocapn\">OCapN group</a>.</p>\n<h3>Secure and Collaborative Internet Systems</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>The grant of $250k in USDC will primarily be used to port the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/\">Guile</a> runtime for Scheme to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly\">WebAssembly</a>. Guile is the Scheme environment that Spritely is built on, so this will allow the Spritely platform to be run anywhere that WebAssembly is available, like a browser, like within MetaMask. This will allow developers to use the Spritely framework to build decentralized applications that run in the browser and can be accessed by users via MetaMask or any other tool that supports WASM.</p>\n<p>With the help of this grant, the Spritely community is confident that it will be able to make a significant impact in the world of secure and collaborative internet systems and MetaMask is proud to support this effort. You can learn more about the Spritely system in their document <a href=\"https://spritely.institute/static/papers/spritely-core.html\"><em>The Heart of Spritely.</em></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you’re a developer, take a look at our Snaps wish list <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/request-for-proposals\">here</a> and apply for a grant to build out a thriving ecosystem with us.</p>\n<p><em>We can’t guarantee when we will review your request or that it will get approved, but know that our team will review the application pipeline as often as we can.

We believe AA will be widely used in the future. However, currently, it takes work for devs to integrate it with their dapps and for users to use it.</p>\n<p>From devs' perspective, it's necessary to write additional code that supports AA in addition to EOA.</p>\n<p>From users' point of view, they cannot use their usual wallets, such as MetaMask, and need to install another wallet that supports AA, which is a bad UX.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we wanted to make it easy to integrate and use AA by utilizing MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>AA Snap is composed of three components: an example frontend, the MetaMask snap, and a temporary server. The snap enables devs and users to use an AA wallet (a contract wallet that supports EIP-4337) very easily. Please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/a42io/AAsnap\">repository</a> for the full implementation.</p>\n<h4>The example frontend</h4>\n<p>The example frontend is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">template</a> that is provided by MetaMask. It shows developers can easily integrate AA with their dapps by AA Snap.</p>\n<p>For example, a balance of the AA wallet can be fetched with the simple code below.</p>\n<pre><code>const balance = (await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n        defaultSnapOrigin,\n        {\n            method: 'balance',\n        },\n    ],\n})) as string;\n</code></pre>\n<p>To send a transaction from the AA wallet, you can just write the code below by passing a beneficiary address and value.</p>\n<pre><code>await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n        defaultSnapOrigin,\n        {\n            method: 'transfer',\n            params: {\n                to,        // beneficiary address\n                value,     // value in ETH or MATIC\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>How easy is it to use the AA wallet from the user’s perspective? Try it here: <a href=\"https://AAsn.app\">https://AAsn.app</a></p>\n<h4>The Snap</h4>\n<p>The snap gets an instance of AA with the code below. To implement AA, we used the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@account-abstraction/sdk\">@account-abstraction/sdk npm package</a>.</p>\n<p>Since the AA wallet address can be deterministically derived from the user’s EOA, no user input is required.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getAbstractAccount = async (): Promise&#x3C;SimpleAccountAPI> => {\n    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(wallet as any);\n    await provider.send('eth_requestAccounts', []);\n    const owner = provider.getSigner();\n    const aa = new SimpleAccountAPI({\n        provider,\n        entryPointAddress,\n        owner,\n        factoryAddress,\n    });\n    return aa;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are three steps to send a transaction from the AA wallet:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The snap shows a confirmation within the MetaMask using the snap’s snap_confirm method. This process is not required but is needed for better UX because there’s no way for users to know the details of what they will sign.</li>\n<li>The code creates a user operation of the AA wallet and requests to sign a hash of the user operation. This process is almost the same as creating a tx from EOA and signing it.</li>\n<li>Send the signed user operation to a bundler via our server.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>export const transfer = async (target: string, ethValue: string) => {\n    const value = ethers.utils.parseEther(ethValue);\n    const aa = await getAbstractAccount();\n    const address = await aa.getAccountAddress();\n\n    // 1. Show confirmation within MetaMask\n    const result = await wallet.request({\n        method: 'snap_confirm',\n        params: [{\n            prompt: 'Transfer',\n            description: 'Transfer from your Abstraction Account',\n            textAreaContent: `from: ${address}\\ntarget: ${target}\\nvalue: ${ethValue}`,\n        }],\n    });\n\n    if (!result) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // 2. Create a signed user operation of AA wallet\n    const op = await aa.createSignedUserOp({\n        target,\n        value,\n        data: '0x',\n        maxFeePerGas,\n        maxPriorityFeePerGas,\n    });\n\n    const printedOp = await printOp(op);\n    const body = JSON.stringify({\n        op: printedOp,\n    });\n\n    // 3. Send a signed user operation to the bundler\n    const response = await fetch(SERVER_END_POINT {\n        method: 'POST',\n        headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        },\n        body,\n    });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>The temporary server</h4>\n<p>During the hackathon, we encountered an error when calling the <code>sendUserOpToBundler</code> method inside the snap. Since we didn’t have time to dig into the issue, we decided to create a server to solve the problem temporarily. The temporary server just receives the signed user operation and passes it to a bundler.</p>\n<p>Because of the error probably came from dependencies because there are some restrictions in the MetaMask Snaps execution environment. We think the temporary server can be removed by following this document: <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-patching-dependencies.html\">Patching Dependencies</a></p>\n<pre><code>app.post('/aa', async (req, res) => {\n  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(\n    process.env.RPC_ENDPOINT,\n  );\n  const client = await getHttpRpcClient(\n    provider,\n    process.env.BUNDLER_URL as string,\n    process.env.ENTRY_POINT_ADDRESS as string,\n  );\n\n  try {\n    const uoHash = await client.sendUserOpToBundler(JSON.parse(req.body.op));\n    return res.json({\n      uoHash,\n    });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.log(e);\n    return res.status(400).send();\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>We would like to remove unnecessary server-side code and run the snap alone. Also, currently, it is possible for the MetaMask Snaps developer like us to replace a transaction hash to be signed with a malicious one, so we would like to introduce or propose a mechanism to prevent it.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6NyWZg6g6mQ2LZ67I9ymt/69d01787c27650246d303960f217022c/Screenshot_2023-01-23_at_3.12.35_PM.png?q=80&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"team \"></p>\n<p>Our team is running a small startup - a42 - in Japan and Singapore. a42 is building a Web3 smart lock \"wΞlock\" that enables auth with smart contracts including NFT and ENS: <a href=\"https://scrapbox.io/a42/w%CE%9Elock\">https://a42.io/w3lock</a>\nIn 2022, we attended several hackathons to learn new technologies like MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hm0429\">Hideyoshi Moriya</a> (piyo.eth): Hideyoshi has been experimenting and building Ethereum based apps since 2017.

Polysnap presents a better approach to code-reuse.  A wide selection of <a href=\"https://polywrap.io/\">Polywrap</a>-empowered Wasm modules are stored on <a href=\"https://www.ipfs.tech/\">IPFS</a>. Polysnap lets app developers execute any Wasm wrapper deployed on IPFS, on the fly and securely, with a simple JSON RPC call, without needing to build a new Snap.</p>\n<p>Users of a dapp relying on the Polysnap don’t need to install multiple snaps but only need to install polysnap which can help reduce potential attack vectors. Dapp using Polysnap can be more secure than traditional snap because Polysnap gatekeep any actions related to host capabilities like internet access, wallet access, etc and would always require user-confirmation before executing any code that relies on these capabilities.</p>\n<p>Dapp developers don’t need to ask users to install multiple Snaps for them to run their app, but rather they can just use one Snap–Polysnap–and run any Polywrap wrappers.</p>\n<p>Snap developers are no longer restricted to JavaScript and the JavaScript ecosystem for Snap development. They can instead write Polywrap wrappers in languages like Rust, Go, and AssemblyScript, and call the wrappers using Polysnap.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>The Polysnap project consists of two elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Polysnap (MetaMask Snap)</li>\n<li>Polysnap Demo Website</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The MetaMask Snap is the main feature, and the focus of the project. The website is used to demonstrate the Snap.</p>\n<h4>The Snap</h4>\n<p>Polysnap can be divided into 3 different parts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Polywrap Client</li>\n<li>Plugin Wrapper</li>\n<li>WASM Wrapper</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1. Polywrap Client</h4>\n<p>Polywrap is building a unified execution environment for the internet that is safe, open, and user-owned.</p>\n<p>Polywrap allows us to create endlessly extensible software that runs anywhere using a Polywrap Client. The Polywrap Client supports running two types of wrappers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wasm Wrapper - any sandboxed Wasm wrapper module built and deployed on IPFS using the Polywrap toolchain</li>\n<li>Plugin Wrapper - any host capability wrapper that exposes different host functionalities like HTTP, the filesystem, and JSON-RPC, to Wasm wrappers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can check out how we are using the Polywrap Client to invoke any wrapper with a simple JSON-RPC call to the Polysnap.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({\n  origin,\n  request,\n}) => {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'wrap_invoke':\n      const invocation = request.params as unknown as InvokerOptions;\n      const isApproved = await wallet.request({\n        method: 'snap_confirm',\n        params: [\n          {\n            prompt: `${origin}`.substring(0, 40),\n            description: `URI: ${invocation.uri}\\nMethod: ${invocation.method}`,\n            textAreaContent: `Args ${JSON.stringify(invocation.args)}`,\n          },\n        ],\n      });\n\n      if (isApproved === true) {\n        const client = await getClient();\n        const response = await client.invoke&#x3C;any>(invocation);\n        if (!response.ok) {\n          throw response.error;\n        }\n        return deserializeMap(response.value);\n      }\n      throw new Error('User declined invocation');\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Method not found.');\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>2. Plugin Wrapper</h4>\n<p>Plugin wrappers are directly embedded into Polysnap with the Polywrap Client. These Plugin wrappers expose the capabilities provided inside Metamask’s SES environement Ex: HTTP, Ethereum JSON-RPC</p>\n<p>We have added support for three different plugins in this MVP.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>HTTP Plugin - exposes API that allows making HTTP GET/POST requests directly from the Wasm Wrapper</li>\n<li>IPFS Plugin - exposes API to store, pin and retrieve files from the IPFS</li>\n<li>IPFS URI Resolver Plugin - exposes API to resolve deployed Wasm Wrappers from the IPFS</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>3. Wasm Wrapper</h4>\n<p>Wasm wrappers are the Wasm modules built and deployed to IPFS using the Polywrap toolchain. Since Wasm is a sandboxed enviroment, it can’t perform any IO unless the host exposes an API to facilitate it. because of this, any Wasm wrappers can be securely run inside the MetaMask Snap. Polysnap can’t run any host functions, like accessing internet, without the help of Plugin wrappers. You can check out all of the IPFS deployed wrappers at: <a href=\"https://wrappers.io/\">wrappers.io</a></p>\n<pre><code>export async function getClient(): Promise&#x3C;PolywrapClient> {\n  const ipfsResolverWrapperResult = await ipfsResolverPlugin(\n    {},\n  ).createWrapper();\n  // IPFS URI RESOLVER\n  if (!ipfsResolverWrapperResult.ok) {\n    throw ipfsResolverWrapperResult.error;\n  }\n  const ipfsUriResolver = new WrapperResolver(\n    Uri.from('ens/ipfs-resolver.polywrap.eth'),\n    ipfsResolverWrapperResult.value,\n  );\n\n  // IPFS RESOLVER\n  const ipfsWrapperResult = await ipfsPlugin({}).createWrapper();\n  if (!ipfsWrapperResult.ok) {\n    throw ipfsWrapperResult.error;\n  }\n  const ipfsResolver = new WrapperResolver(\n    Uri.from('ens/ipfs.polywrap.eth'),\n    ipfsWrapperResult.value,\n  );\n\n  // HTTP RESOLVER\n  const httpWrapperResult = await httpPlugin({}).createWrapper();\n  if (!httpWrapperResult.ok) {\n    throw httpWrapperResult.error;\n  }\n  const httpResolver = new WrapperResolver(\n    Uri.from('ens/http.polywrap.eth'),\n    httpWrapperResult.value,\n  );\n\n  // AGGREGATED RESOLVER\n  const resolver = RecursiveResolver.from([\n    httpResolver,\n    ipfsResolver,\n    ipfsUriResolver,\n    new ExtendableUriResolver(),\n  ]);\n\n  return new PolywrapClient({\n    interfaces: [\n      {\n        interface: new Uri('wrap://ens/uri-resolver.core.polywrap.eth'),\n        implementations: [\n          new Uri('wrap://ens/ipfs-resolver.polywrap.eth'),\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n    envs: [\n      {\n        uri: new Uri('wrap://ens/ipfs.polywrap.eth'),\n        env: {\n          provider: defaultIpfsProviders[0],\n          fallbackProviders: defaultIpfsProviders.slice(1),\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n    resolver,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Polysnap Website</h3>\n<p>The Polysnap website is a simple demo site we created to showcase PolySnap in action. It has a button used to connect a MetaMask wallet and install the Snap, and a query dashboard that submits a JSON RPC call to the Polysnap and displays the result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7uKYSv7s4iS7WnRvfwLrsY/8c71cab6c37573a6d75f452b6a3f3cdf/2Y2rfYy.png\" alt=\"2Y2rfYy\"></p>\n<p>To send an invocation to the Snap, a user provides three elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>uri</code> that resolves to a Wasm wrapper (the hackathon project supports only IPFS URIs, but a future version could support ENS resolution as well)</li>\n<li>The name of the <code>method</code> to invoke</li>\n<li>A json object <code>args</code> that contains the arguments that will be passed to the invoked method</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the “Invoke” button is clicked, the website reads the values in these fields and forwards them to the Snap. The Snap opens a confirmation window to request approval of the invocation, ensuring the app does not make any invocations without the end-user’s consent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3agHLh0hvCpBlEWyPZieAS/b1981895a2c68d487ae805740374a8be/invoke.png\" alt=\"invoke\"></p>\n<p>If the invocation is approved, the Polywrap Client in the Snap handles the invocation and returns the result. The result is printed in a box below the buttons. Of course, in a real-world app, developers would typically set up invocations programmatically and use the result differently.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests, Polysnap is one Snap with the power of many. With just Polysnap, developers can invoke any method in any Polywrap Wasm wrapper written in any Wasm-compilable language.</p>\n<p>The wrappers are downloaded at runtime and cached. Since Wasm wrappers are sandboxed and stateless, Polysnap is adding an additional layer of security to the already-secure Snap environment.</p>\n<p>And it’s all completely decentralized.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the list of all the improvements that we envisioned for the next version of the Polysnap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable support for more Plugin Wrappers such as: Cache, Concurrency, Ethereum, Near, Tezos, etc</li>\n<li>Add permission-based security for access to each Polywrap plugin, ensuring that security can be managed by the end user.</li>\n<li>Create a PolySnap installation website to showcase the Snap, host documentation, make installation easy for end-users</li>\n<li>Add support for IPFS, ENS and HTTP Polywrap URI Resolvers</li>\n<li>Support app developers submitting custom configurations for each invocation of the Polywrap Client configurable while invoking over JSON-RPC with MetaMask Snap</li>\n<li>Support custom cache management solutions for wrappers cached by PolySnap</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are both members of <a href=\"https://dorg.tech\">dOrg</a>, a DAO of freelance software engineers and designers, and also developers at <a href=\"https://polywrap.io\">Polywrap</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthernautKris\">Kris</a> - I am a software engineer in Web3. My life was changed in 2020 when a friend introduced me to dOrg and the decentralized web. I soon joined the team at Polywrap to help build the next generation of SDK developer tools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xKNiraj\">Niraj</a> - I am a Web3 Developer at dOrg and currently working on the Polywrap project as a Core developer. I have been working as Web3 Developer for past 2 years and contributed to Badger, Opolis, Coordinape, and Llama before joining the Polywrap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>We think MetaMask Snaps has the potential to make MetaMask become a hub that will onboard millions of new users to web3. Both developer experience and security are paramount to the success of any plugin ecosystem. We believe that Polysnap can bring both to MetaMask Snaps by making it even more easy-to-use, extensible and secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps allow extending capabilities of MetaMask by writing new extension MetaMask Snaps for your MetaMask wallet. So, it is a very powerful tool that can enable tons of use-cases like integrating different L1 wallets directly inside the MetaMask, Provide more insights for the transactions, etc. And we want to make Devx for enabling such use-cases even easier with Polysnap.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps are still new, but in just one weekend we saw teams build incredible MetaMask Snaps--even a Cosmos wallet that lives in MetaMask. Even if the MetaMask Snaps feature is still in a pre-production state, start early!</p>\n<p>Or instead of writing a new Snap, you might consider writing a Polywrap Wasm wrapper in a language like Rust or AssemblyScript. You can then not only invoke it with Polysnap without having to write a new Snap of your own but also use it anywhere with the Polywrap client.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!
