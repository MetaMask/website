At its core, Snap is a JavaScript program operating inside MetaMask in an isolated environment.</p>\n<p>In this blog we’ll explore the MetaMask Snaps security landscape. As blockchain security auditors from Consensys Diligence, we specialize in smart contract security. <a href=\"https://consensys.io/diligence/\">Consensys Diligence</a> is a blockchain security firm with a comprehensive smart contract audit service to help projects across web3 build safe dapps.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the MetaMask Snap trust model</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Every Snaps developer needs to understand the trust model inherent to MetaMask Snaps. This trust model delineates the trust boundaries between the different actors. The key message to remember is that <strong>end-users trust MetaMask but do not trust the dapps</strong>.</p>\n<p>We formalized and summarized the trust model in the diagram below. This diagram depicts the different trust boundaries that developers must keep in mind when developing Snaps:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1cxlnvrHUZGmJbFmDLaCZL/a0b74120eb660145942647bf6ceb6a4c/image4.png\" alt=\"Snaps security image 1\"></p>\n<h2>Three main trust boundaries for web3 dapps, users, and MetaMask</h2>\n<br />\n<p>First, there is a trust boundary between the user and the dapp. Users never trust dapps. Indeed, dapps can be malicious, or compromised. They can make users believe that they are signing a given payload when in fact, they are signing something else.</p>\n<p>Second, there is a trust boundary around MetaMask and its extensions. Indeed, while users do not trust dapps, they trust MetaMask. MetaMask is the source of truth for the user. The payload displayed and signed inside MetaMask, whether it is through its core module, or Snaps, is what matters.</p>\n<p>Third, there is also a trust boundary between the MetaMask core module and the Snap. Indeed, Snaps developers can interact with the core module of MetaMask through the Snaps API. This API implements a permission system meaning developers have to request permissions before accessing restricted API features. Yet, with appropriate permissions, Snaps can carry out critical actions such as accessing MetaMask root entropy, signing data, or communicating with external APIs.</p>\n<p>In essence, the guiding principle for end-users in the MetaMask ecosystem is straightforward yet profound: <strong>End users should only have to trust in the information and interactions that occur within the MetaMask and MetaMask Snap context, known as the Trust Module.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4u2fefH1GQ4epONLAMmANA/ddd2b824dc021ef6d2a692f0933c3bec/image3.png\" alt=\"Snap security image 2\"></p>\n<h2>Decoding common issues in MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The MetaMask trust model allows for a structured audit approach and helps auditors to identify security issues. During our Snaps audits, we identified different categories of issues. We were still curious about other potential categories. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive analysis across 40 Snaps audited by 9 audit firms. We created a classification and categorized the issues according to this classification. Below we highlight a few interesting categories along with some examples. Note that this list is not exhaustive.</p>\n<h3>User input validation:</h3>\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Markdown &#x26; control character injection: This involves the risk of unwanted code or commands being injected through markdown or control characters in user inputs.</li>\n<li>User input sanitization &#x26; validation:\n<ul>\n<li>Type-checking/type-confusion and parsing issues</li>\n<li>API not rejecting invalid RPC parameters: This problem occurs when the API fails to reject invalid parameters such as incorrect chain IDs, address checksums, or fee structures.</li>\n<li>Improper URI validation: This problem can occur when using lax regex expressions when validating URIs, for instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>User consent &#x26; user interface issues:</h3>\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Breaking MetaMask established UX pattern: This issue surfaces when applications deviate from the established user experience patterns of MetaMask.\n<ul>\n<li>Not prompting the user for account access: MetaMask always prompts the user before connecting any account to the dapp. Snaps developers should follow the same pattern.</li>\n<li>Account enumeration: A privacy concern where the application might enumerate or list user accounts without proper consent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Not asking for user consent:\n<ul>\n<li>When signing payloads: This refers to instances where the application performs signature-related actions without explicit user approval.</li>\n<li>Displaying private key without password visibility toggle: private keys are displayed without using a click-to-reveal component accompanied with a disclaimer text. This can be problematic if the user is in a public environment for instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Opaque snap dialogs: These are dialogs that lack transparency or clarity.\n<ul>\n<li>Transaction signing dialog with missing information: A case where essential information is omitted in transaction signing dialogs, or the information presented to the user is not human-readable.</li>\n<li>Fee rounding imprecision issues: This pertains to inaccuracies or lack of precision in fee calculations and displays.</li>\n<li>Displaying the origin: The Snaps does not display the origin of an action. This can trick the user into thinking the action was initiated by a dapp when in fact it was from another dapp.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Dependency issues:</h3>\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Vulnerable/untrusted dependencies.</li>\n<li>Supply-chain attacks: A dependency can become compromised, either through direct or indirect attack vectors.</li>\n<li>Outdated dependencies: Relying on outdated dependencies can have bad security implications, as these dependencies might contain vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Permission and authorization issues:</h3>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3fZ4XZRiz99SRHJkMV3v4r/c9f975d8efac5681848f902c9a2c5dc4/image1.png\" alt=\"Snaps security image 3\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Superfluous permissions: Granting too many permissions leads to decreased security.</li>\n<li>Accessing low-level permissions: Improperly managing MetaMask root keys entropy for Ethereum for instance.</li>\n<li>Leakage of cryptographic material:\n<ul>\n<li>Dapp requests for private key: Private keys must never leave MetaMask!</li>\n<li>Account management: The snap should prompt the user before connecting any account upon the first connection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are currently refining the results of our analysis and identifying new insights. More is coming soon. Stay tuned :)</p>\n<h2>Key takeaways for Snap developers</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Be aware that you are developing a trust module! users trust MetaMask, but not the dapp. The user must confirm every action and they should have all the information available to make an informed decision. Keys never leave MetaMask. Consequently, as a Snaps developer, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Request minimal permissions:</strong> Snaps should only ask for access to the specific functionalities or data necessary for their operation to minimize the attack surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Validate and sanitize tainted inputs:</strong> Avoid injection attacks or execution of untrusted code.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security MetaMask offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. MetaMask offers Yooldo gamers the tools they need to protect against digital threats of every kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to Yooldo to begin your web3 journey, and join the largest gaming platform on Linea.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
