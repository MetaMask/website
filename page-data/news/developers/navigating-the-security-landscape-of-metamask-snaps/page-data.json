At its core, Snap is a JavaScript program operating inside MetaMask in an isolated environment.</p>\n<p>In this blog we’ll explore the MetaMask Snaps security landscape. As blockchain security auditors from Consensys Diligence, we specialize in smart contract security. <a href=\"https://consensys.io/diligence/\">Consensys Diligence</a> is a blockchain security firm with a comprehensive smart contract audit service to help projects across web3 build safe dapps.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the MetaMask Snap trust model</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Every Snaps developer needs to understand the trust model inherent to MetaMask Snaps. This trust model delineates the trust boundaries between the different actors. The key message to remember is that <strong>end-users trust MetaMask but do not trust the dapps</strong>.</p>\n<p>We formalized and summarized the trust model in the diagram below. This diagram depicts the different trust boundaries that developers must keep in mind when developing Snaps:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1cxlnvrHUZGmJbFmDLaCZL/a0b74120eb660145942647bf6ceb6a4c/image4.png\" alt=\"Snaps security image 1\"></p>\n<h2>Three main trust boundaries for web3 dapps, users, and MetaMask</h2>\n<br />\n<p>First, there is a trust boundary between the user and the dapp. Users never trust dapps. Indeed, dapps can be malicious, or compromised. They can make users believe that they are signing a given payload when in fact, they are signing something else.</p>\n<p>Second, there is a trust boundary around MetaMask and its extensions. Indeed, while users do not trust dapps, they trust MetaMask. MetaMask is the source of truth for the user. The payload displayed and signed inside MetaMask, whether it is through its core module, or Snaps, is what matters.</p>\n<p>Third, there is also a trust boundary between the MetaMask core module and the Snap. Indeed, Snaps developers can interact with the core module of MetaMask through the Snaps API. This API implements a permission system meaning developers have to request permissions before accessing restricted API features. Yet, with appropriate permissions, Snaps can carry out critical actions such as accessing MetaMask root entropy, signing data, or communicating with external APIs.</p>\n<p>In essence, the guiding principle for end-users in the MetaMask ecosystem is straightforward yet profound: <strong>End users should only have to trust in the information and interactions that occur within the MetaMask and MetaMask Snap context, known as the Trust Module.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4u2fefH1GQ4epONLAMmANA/ddd2b824dc021ef6d2a692f0933c3bec/image3.png\" alt=\"Snap security image 2\"></p>\n<h2>Decoding common issues in MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The MetaMask trust model allows for a structured audit approach and helps auditors to identify security issues. During our Snaps audits, we identified different categories of issues. We were still curious about other potential categories. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive analysis across 40 Snaps audited by 9 audit firms. We created a classification and categorized the issues according to this classification. Below we highlight a few interesting categories along with some examples. Note that this list is not exhaustive.</p>\n<h3>User input validation:</h3>\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Markdown &#x26; control character injection: This involves the risk of unwanted code or commands being injected through markdown or control characters in user inputs.</li>\n<li>User input sanitization &#x26; validation:\n<ul>\n<li>Type-checking/type-confusion and parsing issues</li>\n<li>API not rejecting invalid RPC parameters: This problem occurs when the API fails to reject invalid parameters such as incorrect chain IDs, address checksums, or fee structures.</li>\n<li>Improper URI validation: This problem can occur when using lax regex expressions when validating URIs, for instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>User consent &#x26; user interface issues:</h3>\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Breaking MetaMask established UX pattern: This issue surfaces when applications deviate from the established user experience patterns of MetaMask.\n<ul>\n<li>Not prompting the user for account access: MetaMask always prompts the user before connecting any account to the dapp. Snaps developers should follow the same pattern.</li>\n<li>Account enumeration: A privacy concern where the application might enumerate or list user accounts without proper consent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Not asking for user consent:\n<ul>\n<li>When signing payloads: This refers to instances where the application performs signature-related actions without explicit user approval.</li>\n<li>Displaying private key without password visibility toggle: private keys are displayed without using a click-to-reveal component accompanied with a disclaimer text. This can be problematic if the user is in a public environment for instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Opaque snap dialogs: These are dialogs that lack transparency or clarity.\n<ul>\n<li>Transaction signing dialog with missing information: A case where essential information is omitted in transaction signing dialogs, or the information presented to the user is not human-readable.</li>\n<li>Fee rounding imprecision issues: This pertains to inaccuracies or lack of precision in fee calculations and displays.</li>\n<li>Displaying the origin: The Snaps does not display the origin of an action. This can trick the user into thinking the action was initiated by a dapp when in fact it was from another dapp.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Dependency issues:</h3>\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>Vulnerable/untrusted dependencies.</li>\n<li>Supply-chain attacks: A dependency can become compromised, either through direct or indirect attack vectors.</li>\n<li>Outdated dependencies: Relying on outdated dependencies can have bad security implications, as these dependencies might contain vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Permission and authorization issues:</h3>\n<br />\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3fZ4XZRiz99SRHJkMV3v4r/c9f975d8efac5681848f902c9a2c5dc4/image1.png\" alt=\"Snaps security image 3\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Superfluous permissions: Granting too many permissions leads to decreased security.</li>\n<li>Accessing low-level permissions: Improperly managing MetaMask root keys entropy for Ethereum for instance.</li>\n<li>Leakage of cryptographic material:\n<ul>\n<li>Dapp requests for private key: Private keys must never leave MetaMask!</li>\n<li>Account management: The snap should prompt the user before connecting any account upon the first connection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are currently refining the results of our analysis and identifying new insights. More is coming soon. Stay tuned :)</p>\n<h2>Key takeaways for Snap developers</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Be aware that you are developing a trust module! users trust MetaMask, but not the dapp. The user must confirm every action and they should have all the information available to make an informed decision. Keys never leave MetaMask. Consequently, as a Snaps developer, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Request minimal permissions:</strong> Snaps should only ask for access to the specific functionalities or data necessary for their operation to minimize the attack surface.</li>\n<li><strong>Validate and sanitize tainted inputs:</strong> Avoid injection attacks or execution of untrusted code. Given the Snap's ability to extend the functionality of a user's wallet, ensuring that all inputs are secure and free from exploits is vital for protecting both the wallet's integrity and the user's assets.</li>\n<li><strong>Manage supply chain:</strong> Carefully select and update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having those principles and the underlying common issues in mind during development makes the future of Snaps a lot safer for the next billion.</p>\n<p>Consensys Diligence has helped a wide range of projects across the blockchain ecosystem to ensure their protocols are ready for launch and built to protect users.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
