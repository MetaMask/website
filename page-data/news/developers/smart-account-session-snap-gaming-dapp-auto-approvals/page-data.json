First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the Snap is a server and the website is the client.</p>\n<p>Website has following user-flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect your EOA and install the Smart account session Snap.</li>\n<li>Enable Smart Account on top of MetaMask address. MetaMask EOA will be controller of this Smart account.</li>\n<li>Enable Session Module on your Smart Account. Modules enable additional access-control logic for your Smart Safe account. Essentially, every Smart account is controlled by two means. By the MetaMask account owner using their signer keys and by optional modules that have their own custom access logic.</li>\n<li>Create a session.</li>\n<li>This will create a temporary session keys on your smart account that are authorized to transaction on your wallet via module. Session can have parameters like startTime, endTime and Permissions for custom actions on Dapp contracts.</li>\n<li>Send auto approved transactions using above session key without MetaMask pop-up for gas or signatures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Metamask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#restricted-methods\">API calls</a>, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user.</p>\n<p>In this case we have levarged below:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MetaMask. For instance we use it to store created session key pair.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export type SessionKeyStorage = {\n  owner: string;\n  sessionKey: string;\n  pk: string;\n};\n\nexport const storeSessionInfo = async (data: SessionKeyStorage) => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['update', data],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const clearSessionInfo = async () => {\n  const result = await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['clear'],\n  });\n  return result;\n};\n\nexport const getSessionInfo = async () => {\n  const result = await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['get'],\n  });\n  return result;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>snap_confirm</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MetaMask.

He loves programming and learning all things web3 through research and development.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>We learned about MetaMask Snaps shortly before the ETHBogota hackathon. We were super impressed by the documentation and it’s capabilities through snap methods.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>An ability to extend features of MetaMask wallet without depending on the MetaMask core team and enable faster growth. Developers can access existing features of MetaMask like JSON RPC calls interface and storage.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Basic development was very intuitive, but we spent lot of time figuring out some of the permission requirements for specific methods. Ability to build custom UI elements for example to display balance of smart contract wallets just like EOAs is tricky at the momemnt.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a secret weapon which enables us to support ERC4337 Smart contract wallets within MetaMask, without having to build or having dapps to integrate custom widget on their front end.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Dapp-specific customised MetaMask Snaps can provide better user experience and enable multichain interactions.

crypto ecosystem. Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from Metamask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked. As MetaMask’s phishing detection provider, <a href=\"https://chainpatrol.io/\">ChainPatrol</a> recognized the power of a blocklist approach early on.</p>\n<p>While traditional takedowns are still important, in the worst cases it can take over a day to remove a phishing site entirely. MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis. By addressing these threats with speed, users are protected from having their data and wallets compromised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52fcYS0XoMmzrMcPClmA2n/5d826b2547e5e1822f9965016b822080/MetaMask_Threats_Blocked_By_Day_.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Threats Blocked By Day\"></p>\n<p><em>In 2024, ChainPatrol blocked over 29,000 threats targeting Consensys brands including Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility.
