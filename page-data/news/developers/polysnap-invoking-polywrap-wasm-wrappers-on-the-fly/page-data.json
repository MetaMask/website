Polysnap presents a better approach to code-reuse.  A wide selection of <a href=\"https://polywrap.io/\">Polywrap</a>-empowered Wasm modules are stored on <a href=\"https://www.ipfs.tech/\">IPFS</a>. Polysnap lets app developers execute any Wasm wrapper deployed on IPFS, on the fly and securely, with a simple JSON RPC call, without needing to build a new Snap.</p>\n<p>Users of a dapp relying on the Polysnap don’t need to install multiple snaps but only need to install polysnap which can help reduce potential attack vectors. Dapp using Polysnap can be more secure than traditional snap because Polysnap gatekeep any actions related to host capabilities like internet access, wallet access, etc and would always require user-confirmation before executing any code that relies on these capabilities.</p>\n<p>Dapp developers don’t need to ask users to install multiple Snaps for them to run their app, but rather they can just use one Snap–Polysnap–and run any Polywrap wrappers.</p>\n<p>Snap developers are no longer restricted to JavaScript and the JavaScript ecosystem for Snap development. They can instead write Polywrap wrappers in languages like Rust, Go, and AssemblyScript, and call the wrappers using Polysnap.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>The Polysnap project consists of two elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Polysnap (MetaMask Snap)</li>\n<li>Polysnap Demo Website</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The MetaMask Snap is the main feature, and the focus of the project. The website is used to demonstrate the Snap.</p>\n<h4>The Snap</h4>\n<p>Polysnap can be divided into 3 different parts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Polywrap Client</li>\n<li>Plugin Wrapper</li>\n<li>WASM Wrapper</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1. Polywrap Client</h4>\n<p>Polywrap is building a unified execution environment for the internet that is safe, open, and user-owned.</p>\n<p>Polywrap allows us to create endlessly extensible software that runs anywhere using a Polywrap Client. The Polywrap Client supports running two types of wrappers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wasm Wrapper - any sandboxed Wasm wrapper module built and deployed on IPFS using the Polywrap toolchain</li>\n<li>Plugin Wrapper - any host capability wrapper that exposes different host functionalities like HTTP, the filesystem, and JSON-RPC, to Wasm wrappers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can check out how we are using the Polywrap Client to invoke any wrapper with a simple JSON-RPC call to the Polysnap.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({\n  origin,\n  request,\n}) => {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'wrap_invoke':\n      const invocation = request.params as unknown as InvokerOptions;\n      const isApproved = await wallet.request({\n        method: 'snap_confirm',\n        params: [\n          {\n            prompt: `${origin}`.substring(0, 40),\n            description: `URI: ${invocation.uri}\\nMethod: ${invocation.method}`,\n            textAreaContent: `Args ${JSON.stringify(invocation.args)}`,\n          },\n        ],\n      });\n\n      if (isApproved === true) {\n        const client = await getClient();\n        const response = await client.invoke&#x3C;any>(invocation);\n        if (!response.ok) {\n          throw response.error;\n        }\n        return deserializeMap(response.value);\n      }\n      throw new Error('User declined invocation');\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Method not found.');\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>2. Plugin Wrapper</h4>\n<p>Plugin wrappers are directly embedded into Polysnap with the Polywrap Client. These Plugin wrappers expose the capabilities provided inside Metamask’s SES environement Ex: HTTP, Ethereum JSON-RPC</p>\n<p>We have added support for three different plugins in this MVP.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>HTTP Plugin - exposes API that allows making HTTP GET/POST requests directly from the Wasm Wrapper</li>\n<li>IPFS Plugin - exposes API to store, pin and retrieve files from the IPFS</li>\n<li>IPFS URI Resolver Plugin - exposes API to resolve deployed Wasm Wrappers from the IPFS</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>3. Wasm Wrapper</h4>\n<p>Wasm wrappers are the Wasm modules built and deployed to IPFS using the Polywrap toolchain. Since Wasm is a sandboxed enviroment, it can’t perform any IO unless the host exposes an API to facilitate it. because of this, any Wasm wrappers can be securely run inside the MetaMask Snap. Polysnap can’t run any host functions, like accessing internet, without the help of Plugin wrappers. You can check out all of the IPFS deployed wrappers at: <a href=\"https://wrappers.io/\">wrappers.io</a></p>\n<pre><code>export async function getClient(): Promise&#x3C;PolywrapClient> {\n  const ipfsResolverWrapperResult = await ipfsResolverPlugin(\n    {},\n  ).createWrapper();\n  // IPFS URI RESOLVER\n  if (!ipfsResolverWrapperResult.ok) {\n    throw ipfsResolverWrapperResult.error;\n  }\n  const ipfsUriResolver = new WrapperResolver(\n    Uri.from('ens/ipfs-resolver.polywrap.eth'),\n    ipfsResolverWrapperResult.value,\n  );\n\n  // IPFS RESOLVER\n  const ipfsWrapperResult = await ipfsPlugin({}).createWrapper();\n  if (!ipfsWrapperResult.ok) {\n    throw ipfsWrapperResult.error;\n  }\n  const ipfsResolver = new WrapperResolver(\n    Uri.from('ens/ipfs.polywrap.eth'),\n    ipfsWrapperResult.value,\n  );\n\n  // HTTP RESOLVER\n  const httpWrapperResult = await httpPlugin({}).createWrapper();\n  if (!httpWrapperResult.ok) {\n    throw httpWrapperResult.error;\n  }\n  const httpResolver = new WrapperResolver(\n    Uri.from('ens/http.polywrap.eth'),\n    httpWrapperResult.value,\n  );\n\n  // AGGREGATED RESOLVER\n  const resolver = RecursiveResolver.from([\n    httpResolver,\n    ipfsResolver,\n    ipfsUriResolver,\n    new ExtendableUriResolver(),\n  ]);\n\n  return new PolywrapClient({\n    interfaces: [\n      {\n        interface: new Uri('wrap://ens/uri-resolver.core.polywrap.eth'),\n        implementations: [\n          new Uri('wrap://ens/ipfs-resolver.polywrap.eth'),\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n    envs: [\n      {\n        uri: new Uri('wrap://ens/ipfs.polywrap.eth'),\n        env: {\n          provider: defaultIpfsProviders[0],\n          fallbackProviders: defaultIpfsProviders.slice(1),\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n    resolver,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Polysnap Website</h3>\n<p>The Polysnap website is a simple demo site we created to showcase PolySnap in action. It has a button used to connect a MetaMask wallet and install the Snap, and a query dashboard that submits a JSON RPC call to the Polysnap and displays the result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7uKYSv7s4iS7WnRvfwLrsY/8c71cab6c37573a6d75f452b6a3f3cdf/2Y2rfYy.png\" alt=\"2Y2rfYy\"></p>\n<p>To send an invocation to the Snap, a user provides three elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>uri</code> that resolves to a Wasm wrapper (the hackathon project supports only IPFS URIs, but a future version could support ENS resolution as well)</li>\n<li>The name of the <code>method</code> to invoke</li>\n<li>A json object <code>args</code> that contains the arguments that will be passed to the invoked method</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the “Invoke” button is clicked, the website reads the values in these fields and forwards them to the Snap. The Snap opens a confirmation window to request approval of the invocation, ensuring the app does not make any invocations without the end-user’s consent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3agHLh0hvCpBlEWyPZieAS/b1981895a2c68d487ae805740374a8be/invoke.png\" alt=\"invoke\"></p>\n<p>If the invocation is approved, the Polywrap Client in the Snap handles the invocation and returns the result. The result is printed in a box below the buttons. Of course, in a real-world app, developers would typically set up invocations programmatically and use the result differently.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests, Polysnap is one Snap with the power of many. With just Polysnap, developers can invoke any method in any Polywrap Wasm wrapper written in any Wasm-compilable language.</p>\n<p>The wrappers are downloaded at runtime and cached. Since Wasm wrappers are sandboxed and stateless, Polysnap is adding an additional layer of security to the already-secure Snap environment.</p>\n<p>And it’s all completely decentralized.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the list of all the improvements that we envisioned for the next version of the Polysnap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable support for more Plugin Wrappers such as: Cache, Concurrency, Ethereum, Near, Tezos, etc</li>\n<li>Add permission-based security for access to each Polywrap plugin, ensuring that security can be managed by the end user.</li>\n<li>Create a PolySnap installation website to showcase the Snap, host documentation, make installation easy for end-users</li>\n<li>Add support for IPFS, ENS and HTTP Polywrap URI Resolvers</li>\n<li>Support app developers submitting custom configurations for each invocation of the Polywrap Client configurable while invoking over JSON-RPC with MetaMask Snap</li>\n<li>Support custom cache management solutions for wrappers cached by PolySnap</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are both members of <a href=\"https://dorg.tech\">dOrg</a>, a DAO of freelance software engineers and designers, and also developers at <a href=\"https://polywrap.io\">Polywrap</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EthernautKris\">Kris</a> - I am a software engineer in Web3. My life was changed in 2020 when a friend introduced me to dOrg and the decentralized web. I soon joined the team at Polywrap to help build the next generation of SDK developer tools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xKNiraj\">Niraj</a> - I am a Web3 Developer at dOrg and currently working on the Polywrap project as a Core developer. I have been working as Web3 Developer for past 2 years and contributed to Badger, Opolis, Coordinape, and Llama before joining the Polywrap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>We think MetaMask Snaps has the potential to make MetaMask become a hub that will onboard millions of new users to web3. Both developer experience and security are paramount to the success of any plugin ecosystem. We believe that Polysnap can bring both to MetaMask Snaps by making it even more easy-to-use, extensible and secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps allow extending capabilities of MetaMask by writing new extension MetaMask Snaps for your MetaMask wallet. So, it is a very powerful tool that can enable tons of use-cases like integrating different L1 wallets directly inside the MetaMask, Provide more insights for the transactions, etc. And we want to make Devx for enabling such use-cases even easier with Polysnap.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps are still new, but in just one weekend we saw teams build incredible MetaMask Snaps--even a Cosmos wallet that lives in MetaMask. Even if the MetaMask Snaps feature is still in a pre-production state, start early!</p>\n<p>Or instead of writing a new Snap, you might consider writing a Polywrap Wasm wrapper in a language like Rust or AssemblyScript. You can then not only invoke it with Polysnap without having to write a new Snap of your own but also use it anywhere with the Polywrap client.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

across various platforms is crucial. Recognizing this need, MetaMask is thrilled to introduce a new feature within the MetaMask Portfolio to significantly streamline the process of transferring assets between centralized exchange (CEX) platforms like Coinbase and Binance and MetaMask.</p>\n<p>For many users, the digital asset landscape is scattered across multiple wallets and accounts, creating a fragmented experience. The challenge of moving assets from one platform to another has often been a cumbersome process, fraught with the risks of copying and pasting addresses incorrectly and exposing oneself to potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>MetaMask's latest update aims to address this issue head-on, offering a solution that not only enhances user experience but also bolsters security.</p>\n<h4><strong>Instant transfer of assets from exchanges to into your MetaMask wallet</strong></h4>\n<p>With the new integration, users can now effortlessly link their Coinbase or Binance accounts to their MetaMask wallet directly from the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard. MetaMask will never have access to exchange login credentials nor share any MetaMask wallet addresses with any third parties. Check out the below tutorial to see how it easy it is to connect to an exchange and transfer funds:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_wNpeCZubE?si=ZiWR5woPiWo4iS1D\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This seamless connection allows for the instant transfer of assets between accounts, eliminating the need for the manual entry of addresses. Additionally, for those with bank accounts linked to their Coinbase or Binance accounts, purchasing crypto directly into their MetaMask wallet has never been easier. Here's what's new:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Direct Integration</strong>: This feature enables users to transfer assets between their Coinbase or Binance accounts and MetaMask with just a few clicks, bypassing the cumbersome process of copying and pasting addresses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fiat to Crypto Onramp</strong>: Users can now directly convert fiat to crypto in their MetaMask account through their linked bank account on CEXs, streamlining the process of adding funds to their wallets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's important to note that, initially, this feature will support transfers from Coinbase or Binance accounts only, with plans to expand to other exchanges soon. No fees will be charged when transferring assets from exchanges to MetaMask, but a nominal transaction fee of 0.25% will be applied when transferring from MetaMask to centralized exchanges, ensuring the sustainability of this valuable service. Network gas fees also apply.</p>\n<h4><strong>Improving web3 UX with MetaMask step-by-step</strong></h4>\n<p>This update is a step forward in MetaMask's mission to simplify the crypto experience, making it more accessible and secure for users worldwide. By bridging the gap between self-custodial and centralized platforms, MetaMask is not just solving the fragmentation issue within the ecosystem but also paving the way for a more integrated and user-friendly digital asset environment.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"Transfers from CEX now available in MetaMask Portfolio ","metaDescription":"MetaMask's new CEX transfer feature simplifies asset transfers between centralized exchanges, enhancing both security and user experience.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"4uNWsEJpmKwVHI5EaNYsAQ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"More With MetaMask: Mendi Finance Snap","slug":"more-with-metamask-partner-series-mendi-finance","subtitle":"The More With MetaMask Partner Series explores builders who are transforming web3.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership.
