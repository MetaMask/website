A user, when trying to make payments, can end up paying much more than required. Short time high traffic on the blockchain can lead to a huge impact in gas prices. Although L2s were built to reduce gas prices, we sometimes need a more general and easier solution than using an L2 for transaction purposes. We thought it would be useful for users to have an app that can predict future gas prices based on historical data and current trends.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>EtherEyes consists of four parts: Gas price server, the snap, SARIMA Model, web frontend. The gas price server provides data about historical and current gas prices. The website hosts the snap and provides interface to install and interact with the snap by calling snap API methods. We used Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(SARIMA) model to predict gas prices.</p>\n<h4>Gas Price Server</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>We collect live gas price data as a list of around 200 candlesticks (each candlestick is an aggregate of the past 30 minutes of data) using the <a href=\"https://owlracle.info/eth\">Owlracle API</a>. This gives us the timeseries data of past 100 hours of gas prices.</p>\n<h4>The Snap</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>For the snap, we used the transaction insights API to provide realtime gas prices predictions. The flow of the snap is as follows:</p>\n<p>First, when the user starts a transaction, the transaction insights shows up in the confirmation page which is implemented using the onTransactionHandler. Here we show the user about upcoming prediction for next 30 and 60 mins. A simplified version of what we implemented is given here:</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n let state: { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n state = (await wallet.request({\n   method: 'snap_manageState',\n   params: ['get'],\n })) as { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n if (!state) {\n   state = {\n     notifToggle,\n     urgency,\n     lowEth,\n   };\n }\n\n let insights: any = {\n   type: 'Gas Fee estimation',\n };\n\n if (\n   !isObject(transaction) ||\n   !hasProperty(transaction, 'data') ||\n   typeof transaction.data !== 'string'\n ) {\n   console.warn('unknown transaction type');\n   return { insights };\n }\n\n const response = await fetch(`${MODEL_API_ENDPOINT}`, {\n   method: 'get',\n   headers: {\n     'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n   },\n });\n\n const currentData = await fetch(CURRENT_DATA_ENDPOINT, {\n   method: 'get',\n   headers: {\n     'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n   },\n });\n\n if (!response.ok) {\n   throw new Error('API request failed');\n }\n\n const data = await response.json();\n const current = await currentData.json();\n\n state.lowEth = Math.min(data.low_30_minutes, data.low_60_minutes);\n\n await wallet.request({\n   method: 'snap_manageState',\n   params: ['update', state],\n });\n\n insights = {\n   'Average Gas Limit': `Current value: ${current.avgGas}`,\n\n   'Estimated current gas price': `Current value (Base + Priority): ${\n     current.speeds[0].baseFee + current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas\n   } GWei; Base Fee: ${current.speeds[0].baseFee} GWei`,\n\n   'Forecasted Avg Gas price (for the next 30 mins)': `\n   Gas price within 30 minutes is expected to get as low as: ${data.low_30_minutes} GWei`,\n\n   'Forecasted Avg Gas price (for the next 60 mins)': `Gas price within 60 minutes is expected to get as low as: ${Math.min(\n     data.low_30_minutes,\n     data.low_60_minutes,\n   )} GWei`,\n\n   'Expected savings in 30 mins (For average gas limit)': `\n   ${\n     current.avgGas *\n     (current.speeds[0].baseFee +\n       current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas -\n       data.low_30_minutes)\n   } GWei`,\n\n   'Expected savings in 60 mins (For average gas limit)': `${\n     current.avgGas *\n     (current.speeds[0].baseFee +\n       current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas -\n       Math.min(data.low_30_minutes, data.low_60_minutes))\n   } GWei\n   `,\n };\n\n return { insights };\n};\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the user deciedes to wait, he can wait and start a notification system from the website that interacts with the snap via <code>onCronjob</code> handler and sends gas prices after every three minutes as native browser notifications. When the prices get very close to the prediction, it asks the user to complete the transaction.</p>\n<pre><code>\nexport const onCronjob: OnCronjobHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n switch (request.method) {\n   case 'exampleMethodOne': {\n     // get data from state whenever snap is invoked as snaps executions are ephemeral\n     let state: { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n     state = (await wallet.request({\n       method: 'snap_manageState',\n       params: ['get'],\n     })) as { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n     if (!state) {\n       state = {\n         notifToggle,\n         urgency,\n         lowEth,\n       };\n     }\n     notifToggle = state.notifToggle;\n     urgency = state.urgency;\n     lowEth = state.lowEth;\n\n     await wallet.request({\n       method: 'snap_manageState',\n       params: ['update', state],\n     });\n\n     console.log({ notifToggle });\n     if (notifToggle) {\n       const currentData = await fetch(CURRENT_DATA_ENDPOINT, {\n         method: 'get',\n         headers: {\n           'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n         },\n       });\n       const current = await currentData.json();\n       if (Math.abs(current.speeds[0].baseFee - lowEth) &#x3C; urgency / 38) {\n         return wallet.request({\n           method: 'snap_notify',\n           params: [\n             {\n               type: 'native',\n               message: `Gasfee is low!

Another area to improve is the urgency threshold where we need to come up with a more dynamic expression to handle wide variations of market profile, user urgency and transaction gas savings at the same time and quickly arrive at an almost optimal point where the user should make payment. Also we need to make the web interface a bit more user friendly and add some overall error handling at some corner cases which can occur rarely.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are a team consisting of eight BTech engineering students at IIT Patna.

It’s a really unique and interesting add on to MetaMask, and can be used to bring endless customizations in the wallet. The development process is also pretty straightforward and we did not face any major setbacks while developing even though there was less documentation and discussion forum content available. Although it is still in development and lacks few important features as of now,  we can already see the great potential it can have in upcoming years.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is similar to an extension in a web browser. It is used to extend the functionalities of MetaMask. It is safe as the snaps are run in an isolated environment where they have access to a limited set of capabilities determined by the permissions granted by the user during installation. It is a great and safe way to customize your wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s one of the projects that allowed us to witness how different computer science fields could work together to solve a challenge. For my team and I, building this snap was a fantastic learning opportunity. We gained knowledge on how to implement our idea effectively as well as how to use machine learning to solve a problem on blockchain. Along the way, we also established a few new connections. On the other side, rest wallets feel quite restrictive for developers.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Snaps add the features of extensions to a crypto wallet. It is really innovative and can be used for many critical use cases to improve mass adoption of cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Snaps can really be a breakthrough in the web3 ecosystem as it transforms a simple Ethereum wallet to an entire web3 management tool where we can customize and enhance our web3 experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong>\nStart reading the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html\">documentation</a>.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
