A user, when trying to make payments, can end up paying much more than required. Short time high traffic on the blockchain can lead to a huge impact in gas prices. Although L2s were built to reduce gas prices, we sometimes need a more general and easier solution than using an L2 for transaction purposes. We thought it would be useful for users to have an app that can predict future gas prices based on historical data and current trends.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>EtherEyes consists of four parts: Gas price server, the snap, SARIMA Model, web frontend. The gas price server provides data about historical and current gas prices. The website hosts the snap and provides interface to install and interact with the snap by calling snap API methods. We used Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(SARIMA) model to predict gas prices.</p>\n<h4>Gas Price Server</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>We collect live gas price data as a list of around 200 candlesticks (each candlestick is an aggregate of the past 30 minutes of data) using the <a href=\"https://owlracle.info/eth\">Owlracle API</a>. This gives us the timeseries data of past 100 hours of gas prices.</p>\n<h4>The Snap</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>For the snap, we used the transaction insights API to provide realtime gas prices predictions. The flow of the snap is as follows:</p>\n<p>First, when the user starts a transaction, the transaction insights shows up in the confirmation page which is implemented using the onTransactionHandler. Here we show the user about upcoming prediction for next 30 and 60 mins. A simplified version of what we implemented is given here:</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n let state: { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n state = (await wallet.request({\n   method: 'snap_manageState',\n   params: ['get'],\n })) as { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n if (!state) {\n   state = {\n     notifToggle,\n     urgency,\n     lowEth,\n   };\n }\n\n let insights: any = {\n   type: 'Gas Fee estimation',\n };\n\n if (\n   !isObject(transaction) ||\n   !hasProperty(transaction, 'data') ||\n   typeof transaction.data !== 'string'\n ) {\n   console.warn('unknown transaction type');\n   return { insights };\n }\n\n const response = await fetch(`${MODEL_API_ENDPOINT}`, {\n   method: 'get',\n   headers: {\n     'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n   },\n });\n\n const currentData = await fetch(CURRENT_DATA_ENDPOINT, {\n   method: 'get',\n   headers: {\n     'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n   },\n });\n\n if (!response.ok) {\n   throw new Error('API request failed');\n }\n\n const data = await response.json();\n const current = await currentData.json();\n\n state.lowEth = Math.min(data.low_30_minutes, data.low_60_minutes);\n\n await wallet.request({\n   method: 'snap_manageState',\n   params: ['update', state],\n });\n\n insights = {\n   'Average Gas Limit': `Current value: ${current.avgGas}`,\n\n   'Estimated current gas price': `Current value (Base + Priority): ${\n     current.speeds[0].baseFee + current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas\n   } GWei; Base Fee: ${current.speeds[0].baseFee} GWei`,\n\n   'Forecasted Avg Gas price (for the next 30 mins)': `\n   Gas price within 30 minutes is expected to get as low as: ${data.low_30_minutes} GWei`,\n\n   'Forecasted Avg Gas price (for the next 60 mins)': `Gas price within 60 minutes is expected to get as low as: ${Math.min(\n     data.low_30_minutes,\n     data.low_60_minutes,\n   )} GWei`,\n\n   'Expected savings in 30 mins (For average gas limit)': `\n   ${\n     current.avgGas *\n     (current.speeds[0].baseFee +\n       current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas -\n       data.low_30_minutes)\n   } GWei`,\n\n   'Expected savings in 60 mins (For average gas limit)': `${\n     current.avgGas *\n     (current.speeds[0].baseFee +\n       current.speeds[0].maxPriorityFeePerGas -\n       Math.min(data.low_30_minutes, data.low_60_minutes))\n   } GWei\n   `,\n };\n\n return { insights };\n};\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the user deciedes to wait, he can wait and start a notification system from the website that interacts with the snap via <code>onCronjob</code> handler and sends gas prices after every three minutes as native browser notifications. When the prices get very close to the prediction, it asks the user to complete the transaction.</p>\n<pre><code>\nexport const onCronjob: OnCronjobHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n switch (request.method) {\n   case 'exampleMethodOne': {\n     // get data from state whenever snap is invoked as snaps executions are ephemeral\n     let state: { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n     state = (await wallet.request({\n       method: 'snap_manageState',\n       params: ['get'],\n     })) as { notifToggle: boolean; urgency: number; lowEth: number };\n\n     if (!state) {\n       state = {\n         notifToggle,\n         urgency,\n         lowEth,\n       };\n     }\n     notifToggle = state.notifToggle;\n     urgency = state.urgency;\n     lowEth = state.lowEth;\n\n     await wallet.request({\n       method: 'snap_manageState',\n       params: ['update', state],\n     });\n\n     console.log({ notifToggle });\n     if (notifToggle) {\n       const currentData = await fetch(CURRENT_DATA_ENDPOINT, {\n         method: 'get',\n         headers: {\n           'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n         },\n       });\n       const current = await currentData.json();\n       if (Math.abs(current.speeds[0].baseFee - lowEth) &#x3C; urgency / 38) {\n         return wallet.request({\n           method: 'snap_notify',\n           params: [\n             {\n               type: 'native',\n               message: `Gasfee is low!

Another area to improve is the urgency threshold where we need to come up with a more dynamic expression to handle wide variations of market profile, user urgency and transaction gas savings at the same time and quickly arrive at an almost optimal point where the user should make payment. Also we need to make the web interface a bit more user friendly and add some overall error handling at some corner cases which can occur rarely.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are a team consisting of eight BTech engineering students at IIT Patna.

It’s a really unique and interesting add on to MetaMask, and can be used to bring endless customizations in the wallet. The development process is also pretty straightforward and we did not face any major setbacks while developing even though there was less documentation and discussion forum content available. Although it is still in development and lacks few important features as of now,  we can already see the great potential it can have in upcoming years.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is similar to an extension in a web browser. It is used to extend the functionalities of MetaMask. It is safe as the snaps are run in an isolated environment where they have access to a limited set of capabilities determined by the permissions granted by the user during installation. It is a great and safe way to customize your wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s one of the projects that allowed us to witness how different computer science fields could work together to solve a challenge. For my team and I, building this snap was a fantastic learning opportunity. We gained knowledge on how to implement our idea effectively as well as how to use machine learning to solve a problem on blockchain. Along the way, we also established a few new connections. On the other side, rest wallets feel quite restrictive for developers.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Snaps add the features of extensions to a crypto wallet. It is really innovative and can be used for many critical use cases to improve mass adoption of cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Snaps can really be a breakthrough in the web3 ecosystem as it transforms a simple Ethereum wallet to an entire web3 management tool where we can customize and enhance our web3 experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong>\nStart reading the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html\">documentation</a>.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 gaming players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ assets.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamers’ responsibility of security their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask is continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.
