Hear from people in the community building on it today.  </p>\n<h4><strong>Lixin Liu, CEO of Keystone Wallet</strong></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pZnb_qItsJVaAKGRVvewTuIxSNRjILFyMSvOPYplMyRyGrahmvYdUr6Wqs9xr2KIeRz8FY0NQDRPTVYHHAt0Pr7oFI1ZDbxbrnAC9j-olf_54JiavF0CWdY1aH6RJKZr9Qc1cOWE8_zfr-7RnXEtfMA\" width=\"157\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your company?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I am Lixin, CEO of Keystone hardware wallet. I have been a bitcoiner since 2013 and my team started building hardware wallets in late 2017. We spent over three and a half years improving Bitcoin security and then started to work on Ethereum &amp; Web3 from mid 2021. Keystone became one of the hardware wallet partners of MetaMask. Together, we proudly brought QR-code air-gapped signing to the Ethereum &amp; Web3 community.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask in mid 2020. The MetaMask team was very enthusiastic about security and insightful about the benefits of QR-code air-gapped signing. Not long after we started working on Ethereum &amp; Web3, we started to work with the MetaMask team on a hardware wallet integration. When we first noticed MetaMask Flask (Snaps) in early 2022, we strongly felt that it would be huge in the near future. Since we came from the Bitcoin community, it was pretty natural for us to contribute to Bitcoin Snaps using MetaMask Flask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re very enthusiastic about security. Every wallet provider cares about security but not all of them put enough resources into it. The MetaMask’s founders themselves are also deeply into security and they initiated great projects like MobyMask and LavaMoat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Openness. When we were working on adding QR code air-gapped signing to MetaMask extension as well as the mobile application, the MetaMask team was very responsive during the integration and a great joy to work with. When we were working on the Bitcoin Snaps, the Snaps team also had really quick turn-arounds to add APIs or any other requests.</p>\n<p>Responsibility. As we closely worked with MetaMask, we strongly felt that the MetaMask team took the whole of Web3 development as their own responsibility. This mindset deeply differentiated MetaMask from other software wallets as it helps them see things long-term and make decisions that are best for the community.</p>\n<p>Snaps opens the possibility to let more than 30 million users seamlessly manage their Bitcoin. We are super proud we are part of this great milestone for Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>We strongly feel that if Web3 is going to grow as big as Web2, MetaMask could be the “operating system” of Web3. Thus, MetaMask Snaps is basically the pioneer for that purpose.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dietrich Ayala, IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PSSWeGkp30A-a2UWQFpImdNL1Fbo4oqgC5nhwhTRoQiY41h5Yaer4j1fyuVxrHtlOyVCfCOsOj-8JP8EwrGbfa0aNV3qbeWH1TkVOmxwBC9Ovta2fJs3Xpf6GugChwBGxS_HCwZRJm1NGYL9iKR_tJw\" width=\"161\" height=\"161\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your company?</strong></p>\n<p>My name is Dietrich Ayala, and I'm IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs. A lot of my job is getting IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p working in new and weird places where it currently isn't&nbsp; — from web browsers to IoT to satellites in space. Protocol Labs is where each of those technologies were born, and is now one of many stewards and developers involved in their care and feeding. We are continually working on research and development to radically improve the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Probably late 2017 or 2018... I was working at Mozilla and had a side project called <a href=\"https://github.com/libdweb/libdweb\">libdweb</a>, which added extension APIs to enable browsers to be full participants in p2p networks and blockchains, and I'd run a <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/\">series of articles</a> on Mozilla Hacks. Dipping my toe in the water with these initiatives introduced me to a number of projects in the broader crypto/blockchain space (not yet widely referred to as Web3!), including MetaMask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent over a decade building browsers and evangelizing the web, so MetaMask is special to me in that it's been continually focused on the web as a tier 1 platform and pushed against its limits. The web must change and adapt to meet new user needs, and MetaMask's commitment to it will help make that change happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>We've been lucky to work with both MetaMask and Chainsafe on the FIL Snap. It's been challenging and fun to be part of something new and unproven, and which really lets developers like us do more for our communities through a tool they already use and are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>It's exciting to see a direction towards further extensibility - MetaMask as a platform makes sense, and removes a lot of the constraints that come from being EVM-centric.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>It'll lower the barriers to building dapps with Filecoin, and we're excited to see where that goes. It brings the low-barrier-to-entry for end-user apps on the web to so many new and different blockchain ecosystems that I expect we'll see new applications we could not have foreseen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Flask out and build their own Snap?</strong></p>\n<p>Try to build a basic dapp using one of the Snaps... but that's only half done.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
