Hear from people in the community building on it today.  </p>\n<h4><strong>Lixin Liu, CEO of Keystone Wallet</strong></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pZnb_qItsJVaAKGRVvewTuIxSNRjILFyMSvOPYplMyRyGrahmvYdUr6Wqs9xr2KIeRz8FY0NQDRPTVYHHAt0Pr7oFI1ZDbxbrnAC9j-olf_54JiavF0CWdY1aH6RJKZr9Qc1cOWE8_zfr-7RnXEtfMA\" width=\"157\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your company?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I am Lixin, CEO of Keystone hardware wallet. I have been a bitcoiner since 2013 and my team started building hardware wallets in late 2017. We spent over three and a half years improving Bitcoin security and then started to work on Ethereum &amp; Web3 from mid 2021. Keystone became one of the hardware wallet partners of MetaMask. Together, we proudly brought QR-code air-gapped signing to the Ethereum &amp; Web3 community.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>I was first introduced to MetaMask in mid 2020. The MetaMask team was very enthusiastic about security and insightful about the benefits of QR-code air-gapped signing. Not long after we started working on Ethereum &amp; Web3, we started to work with the MetaMask team on a hardware wallet integration. When we first noticed MetaMask Flask (Snaps) in early 2022, we strongly felt that it would be huge in the near future. Since we came from the Bitcoin community, it was pretty natural for us to contribute to Bitcoin Snaps using MetaMask Flask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re very enthusiastic about security. Every wallet provider cares about security but not all of them put enough resources into it. The MetaMask’s founders themselves are also deeply into security and they initiated great projects like MobyMask and LavaMoat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Openness. When we were working on adding QR code air-gapped signing to MetaMask extension as well as the mobile application, the MetaMask team was very responsive during the integration and a great joy to work with. When we were working on the Bitcoin Snaps, the Snaps team also had really quick turn-arounds to add APIs or any other requests.</p>\n<p>Responsibility. As we closely worked with MetaMask, we strongly felt that the MetaMask team took the whole of Web3 development as their own responsibility. This mindset deeply differentiated MetaMask from other software wallets as it helps them see things long-term and make decisions that are best for the community.</p>\n<p>Snaps opens the possibility to let more than 30 million users seamlessly manage their Bitcoin. We are super proud we are part of this great milestone for Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>We strongly feel that if Web3 is going to grow as big as Web2, MetaMask could be the “operating system” of Web3. Thus, MetaMask Snaps is basically the pioneer for that purpose.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dietrich Ayala, IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PSSWeGkp30A-a2UWQFpImdNL1Fbo4oqgC5nhwhTRoQiY41h5Yaer4j1fyuVxrHtlOyVCfCOsOj-8JP8EwrGbfa0aNV3qbeWH1TkVOmxwBC9Ovta2fJs3Xpf6GugChwBGxS_HCwZRJm1NGYL9iKR_tJw\" width=\"161\" height=\"161\"></p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your company?</strong></p>\n<p>My name is Dietrich Ayala, and I'm IPFS Ecosystem Lead at Protocol Labs. A lot of my job is getting IPFS, Filecoin and libp2p working in new and weird places where it currently isn't&nbsp; — from web browsers to IoT to satellites in space. Protocol Labs is where each of those technologies were born, and is now one of many stewards and developers involved in their care and feeding. We are continually working on research and development to radically improve the internet.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Probably late 2017 or 2018... I was working at Mozilla and had a side project called <a href=\"https://github.com/libdweb/libdweb\">libdweb</a>, which added extension APIs to enable browsers to be full participants in p2p networks and blockchains, and I'd run a <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/\">series of articles</a> on Mozilla Hacks. Dipping my toe in the water with these initiatives introduced me to a number of projects in the broader crypto/blockchain space (not yet widely referred to as Web3!), including MetaMask.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent over a decade building browsers and evangelizing the web, so MetaMask is special to me in that it's been continually focused on the web as a tier 1 platform and pushed against its limits. The web must change and adapt to meet new user needs, and MetaMask's commitment to it will help make that change happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team.</strong></p>\n<p>We've been lucky to work with both MetaMask and Chainsafe on the FIL Snap. It's been challenging and fun to be part of something new and unproven, and which really lets developers like us do more for our communities through a tool they already use and are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>It's exciting to see a direction towards further extensibility - MetaMask as a platform makes sense, and removes a lot of the constraints that come from being EVM-centric.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>It'll lower the barriers to building dapps with Filecoin, and we're excited to see where that goes.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, MoonPay.</strong></p>\n<p>MoonPay is a leading crypto company that lets users buy and sell digital assets directly with their MetaMask wallet. Since MoonPay’s partnership with MetaMask began in 2022, we’ve been dedicated to simplifying the management of cryptocurrencies, while keeping users secure. Let’s dive into the ways our collaboration achieves this.</p>\n<h2>Streamlining DeFi onboarding</h2>\n<p>As the demand for self-custodial wallets has risen, so too has the need for robust and intuitive tools that give users a frictionless “web2-like” experience. In the past, the two haven’t always mixed well. Newcomers to crypto, who typically have the highest appetite for intuitive UX, tend to find DeFi overly complex.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this tension, MoonPay saw an opportunity to bridge-the-gap by providing seamless cash-to-crypto onboarding to the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, MetaMask. Integrating with MoonPay allowed MetaMask’s millions of users to interface with DeFi through familiar payment options like credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. It also allowed MetaMask users to benefit from MoonPay’s stringent security protocols.</p>\n<h2>Simplifying ramps to protect users</h2>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the integration is that users can purchase digital assets directly within MetaMask wallet — eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms. This approach smoothes out the process, while keeping users’ information safe. By avoiding unnecessary third-party platforms, data exposure is minimized.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing exposure by helping users stay within the platform, MoonPay is committed to protection and security in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ramps are built with advanced encryption technology like AES-256.</li>\n<li>We comply with PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 standards, ensuring we meet stringent data security criteria.</li>\n<li>Our systems have undergone independent audits for PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001/27018, and SOC2 Type 2 certifications, giving users peace of mind that our safety standards don’t waver.</li>\n<li>Our rigorous Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies helps prevent bad actors from entering our ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating a more secure web3</h2>\n<p>As we continue to work alongside MetaMask, our shared focus on safe, user-friendly solutions remains a cornerstone of this partnership. Together, we’re not only simplifying crypto onboarding for newcomers – we’re setting the bar for what it means to prioritize security in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and selling crypto with your MetaMask wallet via MoonPay has never been easier.
