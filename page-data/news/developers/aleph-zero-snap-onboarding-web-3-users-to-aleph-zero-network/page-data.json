As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways.

On the other hand, integrating with MetaMask Snaps could help onboard an existing population of web3 users to Aleph Zero network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Adapter</strong></p>\n<p>Our snap is composed from two parts. First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the snap is a server and the website is the client. To reflect this natural boundary we have extracted snap API to a separate package named <code>adapter</code>. It exposes all possible methods the website may use to interact with the snap. Such a layer of abstraction, ease usage of the Snap by other clients (websites). Our API can be described by four methods, which names are pretty self-explanatory. If u want to deep dive, here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">code</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const getAccountFromSeed = async (seed: string): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccountFromSeed\", [seed]);\n}\n\nexport const generateNewAccount = async (): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"generateNewAccount\", []);\n}\n\nexport const signTransaction = async (transaction: SignerPayloadJSON): Promise&#x3C;{ signature: string }> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"signTransaction\", [transaction as unknown as string]);\n}\n\nexport const getAccounts = async (): Promise&#x3C;string[]> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccounts\", []);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The app</strong></p>\n<p>So, we explained the glue between our layers, let’s move on to the first layer - website. We have forked the official browser based <a href=\"https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/apps\">polkadot app</a>. Then we had to replace core functionalites like signing transactions, creating accounts or recovering them, from browser based wallet to the Snap based. For example to sign transactions inside MetaMask we changed implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/blob/ed9f12e54c9c721685692f75b78e2f3e1d8b546b/polkadot-apps/packages/react-signer/src/signers/QrSigner.ts#L20\">QrSigner</a> to use Snap <code>signTransaction</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Integrating MetaMask Snap with the polkadot app introduced two improvments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, it allowed to inherit the security model from the MetaMask extension instead of using the polkadot app wallet, which is based on local storage.</li>\n<li>Secondly, we could use MetaMask seed to create a polkadot app in a deterministic way, so whenever we export our seed, the Aleph Zero key will be also exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The MetaMask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides API calls, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user. In this case we have levarged two of them:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MeteMask. For instance we use it to store created accounts. Interacting with state is very easy and can be simplified to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript{numberLines:\" data-meta=\"true}\">const request = async (method: 'clear' | 'get' | 'update', newState?: unknown): Promise&#x3C;any> => {\nif (['get', 'clear'].includes(method) &#x26;&#x26; newState) {\n    throw new Error(`Cannot ${method} with newState`);\n}\nif (method == 'update' &#x26;&#x26; !newState) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot call update without newState');\n}\n\nconst params = newState ? [method, newState] : [method];\nreturn await wallet.request({\n    method: `snap_manageState`,\n    params,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>snap_getBip44Entropy_</code> - to get entropy from MetaMask seed. <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snap-getbip44entropy\">docs</a></p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that there exists very cool MetaMask library <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/browser-passworder\">passworder</a>, which allow us to easily encrypt and decrypt state. In our case as a symmetric key to encrypt state we have used entropy from the MetaMask seed once again.</p>\n<p><strong>The SDK</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s recap, we have hacked polkadot app by injecting some javascript here and there enabling usage of the Snap. The Snap can get entropy from the seed inside MetaMask and manage encrypted state. So the last step would be to integrate with the SDK for the Aleph Zero - <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/\">polkadotjs</a>.</p>\n<p>That seems like a easy task, just run <code>npm install @polkadot/api</code> and import it. However importing dependencies to Snap can be challening. This difficulties appears, because Snap is not evaluated directly on javascript virtual machine, it first has to be sandboxed in Secure Ecma Script (SES). In short, code which normally compile without any problems could fail when loading in <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-development-guide.html#fixing-build-eval-issues\">SES</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">Code</a></p>\n<p>When working with most of the librariers we wont have any problems, but it wasn’t case for us. We had two issues with evaluating <code>polkadotjs SDK</code> inside SES, to mitigate them we have written two scripts which were run on bundled source code.</p>\n<p>First of them was caused by incorrectly formatted wasm code embedded inside javascript file. Here is the fixing script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst dirPath =\n  '../../../../node_modules/@substrate/smoldot-light/dist/cjs/instance/autogen';\n\n// SES doesn't like double slashes in strings so we need to replace them with single slashes\n// and string concatenation.\nasync function fixDoubleSlash() {\n  const files = ['wasm0.js', 'wasm1.js', 'wasm2.js'];\n  for (const file of files) {\n    console.log('Fixing ${file}');\n    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, dirPath, file);\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');\n    let fixedContents = contents;\n    while (fixedContents.includes('//')) {\n      fixedContents = fixedContents.split('//').join('/\"+\"/');\n    }\n    await fs.writeFile(filePath, fixedContents);\n  }\n}\n\nfixDoubleSlash();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second issue was also caused, by polkadot extension, which was trying to access <code>window.addEventListener</code> method, which is forbidden in SES. It was also trivally solved with simple</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst bundlePath = path.join(__dirname, '../dist/bundle.js');\n\nasync function fix() {\n  console.log(`Fixing ${bundlePath}`);\n  const contents = await fs.readFile(bundlePath, 'utf8');\n  const replaceMissingTypes = '\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener = function(){};\\n\\n';\n\n  // Looking for a first breakline after the first line of the file\n  // This is where we can safely inject our code\n  const fixed = contents.replace('\\n\\n', replaceMissingTypes);\n  await fs.writeFile(bundlePath, fixed);\n}\n\nfix();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>We’d love to make make our snap fully compatible with polkadot.js and viable as a web wallet in Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Michael is a programmer in a Polish bank working on a daily basis with blockchain technology. He loves programming and learning new stuff.</p>\n<p>Piotr is a software engineer working in NuCypher. He’s interested in privacy, data, and distributed systems.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Piotr - Initially learned about MetaMask Snaps during Devcon in Osaka. The topic resurfaced earlier this year, shortly before EthDenver hackathon.</p>\n<p>Michaeł - Piotr introduced me to MetaMask Snaps, shortly after EthDenver.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>An ability to access application-specific cryptography/private keys in your dapp—it enables building new user flows on top of a familiar browser-wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>The basics are there, but building more sophisticated MetaMask Snaps, especially ones that require custom UI elements, is tricky. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to fit our mental model of web developer experience into Snaps - things like deployment, testing, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a tool which gives real power to the community, everyone for themself decides what features their MetaMask should have. Plugins allows to democratize development and enable faster growth.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Access to more networks (especially non-EVM ones); An ability to tap into transaction lifecycle and add custom logic (like safety checks) or customize the UX; Encrypted storage in the browser for dapp-specific sensitive content, and also an ability to “bring your own cryptography” to your users with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Compiling JS libraries in SES could be difficult, but from our experience it’s not impossible. Feedback loop in developing MetaMask is pretty long, so be sure to write unit tests.</p>\n<p>There is a small but active developers community in MetaMask Snaps - visiting Discord, GitHub discussions etc. can be very rewarding, especially that the product is still new and there is little education avalible outside this bubble.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
