As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Aleph Zero Snap with Piotr and Michael</h3>\n<p>We chat with Web3 developers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piotrroslaniec\">Piotr</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/konopek68\">Michael</a> who built the Aleph Zero Snap at the ETHWarsaw Hackathon.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lS5-YwOy9gE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>In our views the wallet experience in Polkadot ecosystem is still lacking. On the other hand, integrating with MetaMask Snaps could help onboard an existing population of web3 users to Aleph Zero network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Adapter</strong></p>\n<p>Our snap is composed from two parts. First is a website that users interact with. The second one is the actual Snap. Those two elements work in a way similar to client-server architecture, where the snap is a server and the website is the client. To reflect this natural boundary we have extracted snap API to a separate package named <code>adapter</code>. It exposes all possible methods the website may use to interact with the snap. Such a layer of abstraction, ease usage of the Snap by other clients (websites). Our API can be described by four methods, which names are pretty self-explanatory. If u want to deep dive, here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">code</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const getAccountFromSeed = async (seed: string): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccountFromSeed\", [seed]);\n}\n\nexport const generateNewAccount = async (): Promise&#x3C;PublicAccount> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"generateNewAccount\", []);\n}\n\nexport const signTransaction = async (transaction: SignerPayloadJSON): Promise&#x3C;{ signature: string }> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"signTransaction\", [transaction as unknown as string]);\n}\n\nexport const getAccounts = async (): Promise&#x3C;string[]> => {\n  return await requestSnap(\"getAccounts\", []);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The app</strong></p>\n<p>So, we explained the glue between our layers, let’s move on to the first layer - website. We have forked the official browser based <a href=\"https://github.com/Cardinal-Cryptography/apps\">polkadot app</a>. Then we had to replace core functionalites like signing transactions, creating accounts or recovering them, from browser based wallet to the Snap based. For example to sign transactions inside MetaMask we changed implementation of <a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/blob/ed9f12e54c9c721685692f75b78e2f3e1d8b546b/polkadot-apps/packages/react-signer/src/signers/QrSigner.ts#L20\">QrSigner</a> to use Snap <code>signTransaction</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Integrating MetaMask Snap with the polkadot app introduced two improvments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly, it allowed to inherit the security model from the MetaMask extension instead of using the polkadot app wallet, which is based on local storage.</li>\n<li>Secondly, we could use MetaMask seed to create a polkadot app in a deterministic way, so whenever we export our seed, the Aleph Zero key will be also exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The MetaMask API</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask provides API calls, which can be used by MetaMask Snaps if permitted by user. In this case we have levarged two of them:</p>\n<p><code>snap_manageState</code> - which allow as two store encrypted data inside MeteMask. For instance we use it to store created accounts. Interacting with state is very easy and can be simplified to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript{numberLines:\" data-meta=\"true}\">const request = async (method: 'clear' | 'get' | 'update', newState?: unknown): Promise&#x3C;any> => {\nif (['get', 'clear'].includes(method) &#x26;&#x26; newState) {\n    throw new Error(`Cannot ${method} with newState`);\n}\nif (method == 'update' &#x26;&#x26; !newState) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot call update without newState');\n}\n\nconst params = newState ? [method, newState] : [method];\nreturn await wallet.request({\n    method: `snap_manageState`,\n    params,\n  });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>snap_getBip44Entropy_</code> - to get entropy from MetaMask seed. <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snap-getbip44entropy\">docs</a></p>\n<p>It is worth to mention that there exists very cool MetaMask library <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metamask/browser-passworder\">passworder</a>, which allow us to easily encrypt and decrypt state. In our case as a symmetric key to encrypt state we have used entropy from the MetaMask seed once again.</p>\n<p><strong>The SDK</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s recap, we have hacked polkadot app by injecting some javascript here and there enabling usage of the Snap. The Snap can get entropy from the seed inside MetaMask and manage encrypted state. So the last step would be to integrate with the SDK for the Aleph Zero - <a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/\">polkadotjs</a>.</p>\n<p>That seems like a easy task, just run <code>npm install @polkadot/api</code> and import it. However importing dependencies to Snap can be challening. This difficulties appears, because Snap is not evaluated directly on javascript virtual machine, it first has to be sandboxed in Secure Ecma Script (SES). In short, code which normally compile without any problems could fail when loading in <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-development-guide.html#fixing-build-eval-issues\">SES</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/piotr-roslaniec/ethwarsaw-2022/tree/main/azero-snap/packages/snap-adapter\">Code</a></p>\n<p>When working with most of the librariers we wont have any problems, but it wasn’t case for us. We had two issues with evaluating <code>polkadotjs SDK</code> inside SES, to mitigate them we have written two scripts which were run on bundled source code.</p>\n<p>First of them was caused by incorrectly formatted wasm code embedded inside javascript file. Here is the fixing script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst dirPath =\n  '../../../../node_modules/@substrate/smoldot-light/dist/cjs/instance/autogen';\n\n// SES doesn't like double slashes in strings so we need to replace them with single slashes\n// and string concatenation.\nasync function fixDoubleSlash() {\n  const files = ['wasm0.js', 'wasm1.js', 'wasm2.js'];\n  for (const file of files) {\n    console.log('Fixing ${file}');\n    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, dirPath, file);\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');\n    let fixedContents = contents;\n    while (fixedContents.includes('//')) {\n      fixedContents = fixedContents.split('//').join('/\"+\"/');\n    }\n    await fs.writeFile(filePath, fixedContents);\n  }\n}\n\nfixDoubleSlash();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second issue was also caused, by polkadot extension, which was trying to access <code>window.addEventListener</code> method, which is forbidden in SES. It was also trivally solved with simple</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs').promises;\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst bundlePath = path.join(__dirname, '../dist/bundle.js');\n\nasync function fix() {\n  console.log(`Fixing ${bundlePath}`);\n  const contents = await fs.readFile(bundlePath, 'utf8');\n  const replaceMissingTypes = '\\n\\nwindow.addEventListener = function(){};\\n\\n';\n\n  // Looking for a first breakline after the first line of the file\n  // This is where we can safely inject our code\n  const fixed = contents.replace('\\n\\n', replaceMissingTypes);\n  await fs.writeFile(bundlePath, fixed);\n}\n\nfix();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>We’d love to make make our snap fully compatible with polkadot.js and viable as a web wallet in Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Michael is a programmer in a Polish bank working on a daily basis with blockchain technology. He loves programming and learning new stuff.</p>\n<p>Piotr is a software engineer working in NuCypher. He’s interested in privacy, data, and distributed systems.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Piotr - Initially learned about MetaMask Snaps during Devcon in Osaka. The topic resurfaced earlier this year, shortly before EthDenver hackathon.</p>\n<p>Michaeł - Piotr introduced me to MetaMask Snaps, shortly after EthDenver.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>An ability to access application-specific cryptography/private keys in your dapp—it enables building new user flows on top of a familiar browser-wallet experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>The basics are there, but building more sophisticated MetaMask Snaps, especially ones that require custom UI elements, is tricky. We spent a lot of time figuring out how to fit our mental model of web developer experience into Snaps - things like deployment, testing, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It is a tool which gives real power to the community, everyone for themself decides what features their MetaMask should have. Plugins allows to democratize development and enable faster growth.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Access to more networks (especially non-EVM ones); An ability to tap into transaction lifecycle and add custom logic (like safety checks) or customize the UX; Encrypted storage in the browser for dapp-specific sensitive content, and also an ability to “bring your own cryptography” to your users with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Compiling JS libraries in SES could be difficult, but from our experience it’s not impossible. Feedback loop in developing MetaMask is pretty long, so be sure to write unit tests.</p>\n<p>There is a small but active developers community in MetaMask Snaps - visiting Discord, GitHub discussions etc. can be very rewarding, especially that the product is still new and there is little education avalible outside this bubble.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence.
