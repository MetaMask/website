One method to collect user feedback is to integrate a  feedback or survey form into dapps. Feedback forms bridge the communication gap between users and developers and provide real-time feedback at scale to improve applications. They also foster an environment of active participation and collective decision-making.</p>\n<p>From Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) employing feedback forms for on-chain governance, to businesses leveraging them to gauge employee sentiment, the utility of feedback forms is infinite.</p>\n<p>This blog provides a step-by-step tutorial to integrate a feedback form into your application backend and start collecting user feedback. For this, we will use a feedback form we built in-house using the MetaMask SDK and other Consensys tools called, Form xChange.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/pFaNvxTSN7V4XX1EUsc6g/f0d4056dc33dcfd5f850c28bf3ce9e89/image3.png\" alt=\"image3\">\n<em><a href=\"http://form-x-change.vercel.app\">Form xChange</a></em></p>\n<p>Whether you're looking to improve your dapp’s UX, collect post-conference feedback, or a DAO member aiming to democratize decision-making, this tutorial will show you how to integrate a feedback form and open a new channel of communication within your application.</p>\n<h3>What is Form xChange and how does it work?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ConsenSys/Form-XChange\">Form xChange</a> is an open-sourced tool, developed for the creation and utilization of feedback forms on the blockchain. While the smart contract for Form xChange is currently deployed on <a href=\"http://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, its adaptable architecture allows for deployment on any EVM-compatible network.</p>\n<p>The platform enables participants to cast anonymous votes on the proposals incorporated within these forms and provides both participants and form creators access to view the results, reflecting the transparency ethos of web3.</p>\n<p>Form xChange utilizes a user-friendly interface built with Next.js and operates using two smart contracts, both written in Solidity: the <strong>FeedbackForm</strong> contract and the <strong>FeedbackFormFactory</strong> contract. The process is straightforward—every time a new form is created, a new FeedbackForm contract is deployed, a task handled efficiently by the FeedbackFormFactory contract.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5sXAlyRmpNTTZvcVyx2kf6/f80225e34395661e84b225fa8d5c8fdd/image1.png\" alt=\"image1\"></p>\n<p>To utilize Form xChange, users must first connect and sign into the application using their MetaMask wallet. Some of the supported roles and responsibilities are:</p>\n<p><strong>Form Author</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to create new forms containing multiple questions for feedback collection.</li>\n<li>Ability to view an average score derived from user responses to each section post-feedback collection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Participant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to submit responses to forms or proposals while preserving anonymity.</li>\n<li>Access to view the results post-response submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Integrate a feedback form into your dapp for user feedback at scale</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Users with less sophisticated use cases can simply rely on the already <a href=\"https://form-x-change.vercel.app/\">deployed instance</a> of Form xChange but if you have a unique use case and would like to host your own instance or control what the user interface looks like, then this part of the blog is for you.</p>\n<p>We’ll go through how to clone the repository to your local machine and get the backend running, we’ll deploy a new instance of the Form  xChange backend to Linea and finally, we’ll touch on the MetaMask SDK and how it makes it easy to connect users' MetaMask wallet clients from any platform.</p>\n<p>We’ll not be building out a user interface as it is beyond the scope of this tutorial but feel free to check out this <a href=\"https://github.com/ConsenSys/Form-XChange/tree/a63a3f482157d4d8325d1ca64852486a808086f1/apps/web\">repository</a> to get an idea of how you can approach building out your own user interface.</p>\n<h3>How to clone the Form xChange backend</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>This section assumes that you have node.js v16 or above installed on your computer, as well as the <a href=\"https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/\">Truffle development environment</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Clone the repository:\n<code>git clone git@github.com:ConsenSys/Form-XChange.git</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the contract directory:\n<code>cd Form-XChange/packages/form-XChange</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compile contract:\n<code>truffle compile</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run test:\n<code>truffle test</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to deploy your own instance of the Form xChange backend to Linea</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>What is Linea and why deploy on Linea? Well, <a href=\"https://docs.linea.build/users\">Linea</a> is a type 2 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) that replicates the Ethereum environment as a rollup, allowing developers to build on it with the experience and security of Ethereum but with lower transaction costs.</p>\n<p>Linea offers advantages like faster finality, compatibility with all development tools, default integration with MetaMask, and high throughput among other things, which makes it an excellent choice for deploying Form xChange backend.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand what Linea is and why it is a great choice, let's delve into how one can deploy to Linea. To follow through with this section, ensure you have the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet extension</a> installed as well as some Linea Eth. See <a href=\"https://docs.linea.build/users/move-funds/fund#linea-sepolia\">documentation</a> for more information on how to get some Linea Eth.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Run the Truffle dashboard: <code>truffle dashboard</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head to <code>localhost:24012</code> in your browser and connect your MetaMask wallet, then select Linea from the networks dropdown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run <code>truffle migrate --network dashboard</code> in a separate terminal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head back to <code>localhost:24012</code> and click confirm on the prompt asking you to confirm the deployment.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it, you should see the newly deployed contract address on the terminal window you ran the <code>truffle migrate --network dashboard command</code>. You can verify successful deployment by visiting the <a href=\"https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/\">Linea block explorer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Use MetaMask SDK to seamlessly connect your dapp to users’ wallets</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>With the Form XChange backend deployed to Linea, we want to make sure that users are not faced with any difficulties when they interact with our dapps. In other words, we want to make it seamless for users to connect their wallet client to our dapp without any hassle.</p>\n<p>MetaMask presents the most effective method to connect to any dapp deployed on Linea, as the MetaMask wallet extension now includes a Linea network option by default. Furthermore, to simplify the process for developers to add MetaMask support to their dapps, MetaMask recently released the MetaMask <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">SDK</a> that can be used with JavaScript, Mobile and Gaming platforms.</p>\n<p>To use the MetaMask SDK in your React frontend code base, here are some steps you can follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the MetaMask SDK using Yarn or NPM:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>yarn add @metamask/sdk or npm install @metamask sdk</code></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Import the MetaMask SDK into your React project:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>import { MetaMaskSDK } from '@metamask/sdk';</code></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Instantiate the MetaMask SDK using these options</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code> const sdk = new MetaMaskSDK(options);\n sdk.getProvider(); \n\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Access the MetaMask SDK anywhere in your React codebase:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts', params: [] });</code></p>\n<p>Calling <code>eth_requestAccounts</code> using <code>ethereum.request()</code> prompts the installation or connection popup to appear so it is advisable to always call this function first.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">MetaMask SDK documentation</a> for more information on how you can use the MetaMask SDK with Node.js, IOS, Unity and more.</p>\n<p>Form xChange enhances your dapp by facilitating valuable feedback collection and promoting increased user input and participatory decision-making.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. MetaMask offers Yooldo gamers the tools they need to protect against digital threats of every kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to begin your web3 gaming journey.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
