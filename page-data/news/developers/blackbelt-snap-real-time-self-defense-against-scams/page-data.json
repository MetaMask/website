Especially new and non-tech savvy users that are afraid to fall victim to scams and exploits. Therefore, we thought of a way to provide real-time risks assessment for smart contract interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The technical setup</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbelt consists of three elements: our server, the MetaMask snap, and our website front-end. The server retrieves data and calculates the smart contract risk scores. The MetaMask snap as well as our website call the server and supply the specific contract address within the https request. The full implementation of our project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/s-a-malik/blackbelt\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The server</strong></p>\n<p>Our server consists of a flask back-end that returns security scores and metadata as json. When a <code>GET</code> request is initiate to the route <code>/security_score</code>, the function <code>security_score()</code> is called. First, all supplied parameters, such as contract address, user address, chain id, and caller origin, will be unpacked and then partially parsed into the function <code>compute_security_score(contract_address, chain)</code> which will retrieve on-chain data and computes security scores for multiple variable (e.g., contract age). To speed up data retrieval inside MetaMask Snaps, we provide cached results if available when the server is called via MetaMask Snaps (see variable <code>is_snaps</code>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def security_score():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the security score and the metadata used to compute it for a given contract address.\n    Saves result to ipfs and local storage.\n    Params:\n    - user_address: the address of the user to check\n    - contract_address (str): eth address of the contract\n    - chain_id (int): chain to check the contract on\n    Returns:\n    - score (int): The security score (0-100)\n    - contract_info (dict):        \n    \"\"\"\n    user_address = request.args.get('user_address', type=str)\n    contract_address = request.args.get('contract_address', type=str)\n    chain_id = request.args.get('chain', default=1, type=int)\n    is_snaps = request.args.get('is_snaps', default=False, type=str)\n\n    #Check if chached results should be provided\n    is_snaps = True if is_snaps == \"true\" else False\n    if is_snaps and contract_address in contract_to_score:\n        #Retrieve from cache and return\n        return contract_to_score[contract_address][0]\n    else:\n        chain = \"mainnet\" if chain_id == 1 else \"goerli\"\n\n        #Calculate new security score\n        output = compute_security_score(contract_address, chain)\n        if output[\"status\"] != \"ok\":\n            return output\n\n        #Add to the server cache\n        contract_to_score[contract_address].append(output)\n        user_to_transactions[user_address].append(output)\n\n    return output\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>compute_security_score</code> function (in the <code>logic.py</code> file) calculates a heuristic risk score based on on-chain data from Coinbase Cloud APIs, etherscan APIs, and our own community-curated server-side database of reported malicious addresses. A few examples of the type of factors used to compute the score is shown in the snippet below. For example, we check if the contract is declared as verified and audited on etherscan, and how old the contract is.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># in the compute_security_score function:\n# ...\nverified = is_verified(contract_address, chain)\naudited = is_audited(contract_address, chain)\ntransactions, users, deployed_date_unix = numberOfTransactionsAndUsersAndAge(contract_address)\nmin_age_of_contract_in_days = (time.time() - deployed_date_unix) / 86400\nnum_times_reported = blacklist_dict[contract_address]\n# ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the future, we plan to integrate more sources of information that could help identify malicious contracts (such as automated verification tools and existing blacklist databases), and also employ more nuanced computation of the risk score, for example, using machine learning methods.</p>\n<p><strong>The snap</strong></p>\n<p>For the snap we use the transactions insights API which is triggered whenever a transaction is happening. The snap consists of four steps. First, the transaction key details are retrieved from the transaction struct. Second, the tx details are send to our server and we retrieve the security score plus metadata. Third, we check the request status and handle any errors. Fourth, we return the security score and metadata as json object within MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nexport const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({\n  transaction,\n  chainId,\n}) => {\n\n  // Get tx data\n  const user_address = transaction.from;\n  const contract_address =  transaction.to;\n  const chain_id =  chainId.split(\":\")[1];\n\n  // Call api for risk assessment\n  const url = 'https://blackbelt.xyz/security_score?contract_address='+contract_address+'&#x26;user_address='+user_address+'&#x26;chain='+chain_id+'&#x26;is_snaps=true';\n  let x = await fetch(url);\n  let data = await x.json();\n\n  // Cases for returning insights\n  if (data.status == \"ok\"){\n    const individual_scores = stringify_json('individual_scores', data)\n    const individual_details = stringify_json('contract_info', data)\n    return {\n      insights: {\"Risk Assessment\": data.risk_level, \"Security Score\": data.security_score, \"Recommendation\": data.recommendation, \"Details\": individual_details, \"Individual Scores\": individual_scores, \"Assessment Timestamp\": data.risk_assessment_timestamp, \"IPFS Storage Hash\": data.ipfs_hash},\n    };\n  } else if(data.status =='error, not a contract address'){\n    return {\n      insights: {\"No Score Available\": \"No interaction with a smart contract detected.\", \"Assessment Timestamp\": data.risk_assessment_timestamp},\n    };\n  } else if(data.status =='error, unsupported chain'){\n    return {\n      insights: {\"Chain Not Supported\": \"We are currently supporting Ethereum and Goerli only. We are working on adding more networks.\"},\n    };\n  } else {\n    return {\n      insights: {\"Unknown Error\": \"An unknown error occured. Please contact the team and try again later.\"},\n    };\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The website</strong></p>\n<p>The website is written in react and is used to quickly test our feature before adding it to MetaMask. Users can try our feature by supplying a contract address and pressing “Rate now”.

Currently, our assessment is based on heuristic, such as the number of DAU or transactions (the higher the better), but we would like to include some more advanced technique like machine learning to calculate the risk score more accurately, After improving the analytics, we would focus on speeding up the whole risk assessment process to make the user experience as seamless as possible - this could be done through caching or faster data retrieval procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are a team consisting of three Oxford PhD students and one Oxford graduate.

It was the perfect feature to bring Blackbelt to life in the most user-friendly way. Overall, the experience with MetaMask Snaps was pleasant as MetaMask Snaps are fairly easy to use. Given the novelty of MetaMask Snaps there are still some minor hiccups that occasionally caused us some headache during the hackathon but nothing really major.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is a great way to open source the development of wallet extensions and to enable diverse and individual solutions for end-users with different needs. As far as we know - MetaMask is the only wallet provider so far that supports custom plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Building with MetaMask Snaps was fairly easy. We started with one of the example projects that helped us to better understand the mechanics of MetaMask Snaps and then build on top of the example code. Building in MetaMask Snaps was fun but occasionally some bugs really challenged us, especially given the tight deadline during the hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the feature we always wished we had in our wallets.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently.
