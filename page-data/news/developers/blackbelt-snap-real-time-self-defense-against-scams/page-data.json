Especially new and non-tech savvy users that are afraid to fall victim to scams and exploits. Therefore, we thought of a way to provide real-time risks assessment for smart contract interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The technical setup</strong></p>\n<p>Blackbelt consists of three elements: our server, the MetaMask snap, and our website front-end. The server retrieves data and calculates the smart contract risk scores. The MetaMask snap as well as our website call the server and supply the specific contract address within the https request. The full implementation of our project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/s-a-malik/blackbelt\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The server</strong></p>\n<p>Our server consists of a flask back-end that returns security scores and metadata as json. When a <code>GET</code> request is initiate to the route <code>/security_score</code>, the function <code>security_score()</code> is called. First, all supplied parameters, such as contract address, user address, chain id, and caller origin, will be unpacked and then partially parsed into the function <code>compute_security_score(contract_address, chain)</code> which will retrieve on-chain data and computes security scores for multiple variable (e.g., contract age). To speed up data retrieval inside MetaMask Snaps, we provide cached results if available when the server is called via MetaMask Snaps (see variable <code>is_snaps</code>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def security_score():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the security score and the metadata used to compute it for a given contract address.\n    Saves result to ipfs and local storage.\n    Params:\n    - user_address: the address of the user to check\n    - contract_address (str): eth address of the contract\n    - chain_id (int): chain to check the contract on\n    Returns:\n    - score (int): The security score (0-100)\n    - contract_info (dict):        \n    \"\"\"\n    user_address = request.args.get('user_address', type=str)\n    contract_address = request.args.get('contract_address', type=str)\n    chain_id = request.args.get('chain', default=1, type=int)\n    is_snaps = request.args.get('is_snaps', default=False, type=str)\n\n    #Check if chached results should be provided\n    is_snaps = True if is_snaps == \"true\" else False\n    if is_snaps and contract_address in contract_to_score:\n        #Retrieve from cache and return\n        return contract_to_score[contract_address][0]\n    else:\n        chain = \"mainnet\" if chain_id == 1 else \"goerli\"\n\n        #Calculate new security score\n        output = compute_security_score(contract_address, chain)\n        if output[\"status\"] != \"ok\":\n            return output\n\n        #Add to the server cache\n        contract_to_score[contract_address].append(output)\n        user_to_transactions[user_address].append(output)\n\n    return output\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>compute_security_score</code> function (in the <code>logic.py</code> file) calculates a heuristic risk score based on on-chain data from Coinbase Cloud APIs, etherscan APIs, and our own community-curated server-side database of reported malicious addresses. A few examples of the type of factors used to compute the score is shown in the snippet below. For example, we check if the contract is declared as verified and audited on etherscan, and how old the contract is.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># in the compute_security_score function:\n# ...\nverified = is_verified(contract_address, chain)\naudited = is_audited(contract_address, chain)\ntransactions, users, deployed_date_unix = numberOfTransactionsAndUsersAndAge(contract_address)\nmin_age_of_contract_in_days = (time.time() - deployed_date_unix) / 86400\nnum_times_reported = blacklist_dict[contract_address]\n# ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the future, we plan to integrate more sources of information that could help identify malicious contracts (such as automated verification tools and existing blacklist databases), and also employ more nuanced computation of the risk score, for example, using machine learning methods.</p>\n<p><strong>The snap</strong></p>\n<p>For the snap we use the transactions insights API which is triggered whenever a transaction is happening. The snap consists of four steps. First, the transaction key details are retrieved from the transaction struct. Second, the tx details are send to our server and we retrieve the security score plus metadata. Third, we check the request status and handle any errors. Fourth, we return the security score and metadata as json object within MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nexport const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({\n  transaction,\n  chainId,\n}) => {\n\n  // Get tx data\n  const user_address = transaction.from;\n  const contract_address =  transaction.to;\n  const chain_id =  chainId.split(\":\")[1];\n\n  // Call api for risk assessment\n  const url = 'https://blackbelt.xyz/security_score?contract_address='+contract_address+'&#x26;user_address='+user_address+'&#x26;chain='+chain_id+'&#x26;is_snaps=true';\n  let x = await fetch(url);\n  let data = await x.json();\n\n  // Cases for returning insights\n  if (data.status == \"ok\"){\n    const individual_scores = stringify_json('individual_scores', data)\n    const individual_details = stringify_json('contract_info', data)\n    return {\n      insights: {\"Risk Assessment\": data.risk_level, \"Security Score\": data.security_score, \"Recommendation\": data.recommendation, \"Details\": individual_details, \"Individual Scores\": individual_scores, \"Assessment Timestamp\": data.risk_assessment_timestamp, \"IPFS Storage Hash\": data.ipfs_hash},\n    };\n  } else if(data.status =='error, not a contract address'){\n    return {\n      insights: {\"No Score Available\": \"No interaction with a smart contract detected.\", \"Assessment Timestamp\": data.risk_assessment_timestamp},\n    };\n  } else if(data.status =='error, unsupported chain'){\n    return {\n      insights: {\"Chain Not Supported\": \"We are currently supporting Ethereum and Goerli only. We are working on adding more networks.\"},\n    };\n  } else {\n    return {\n      insights: {\"Unknown Error\": \"An unknown error occured. Please contact the team and try again later.\"},\n    };\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The website</strong></p>\n<p>The website is written in react and is used to quickly test our feature before adding it to MetaMask. Users can try our feature by supplying a contract address and pressing “Rate now”.

Currently, our assessment is based on heuristic, such as the number of DAU or transactions (the higher the better), but we would like to include some more advanced technique like machine learning to calculate the risk score more accurately, After improving the analytics, we would focus on speeding up the whole risk assessment process to make the user experience as seamless as possible - this could be done through caching or faster data retrieval procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We are a team consisting of three Oxford PhD students and one Oxford graduate.

It was the perfect feature to bring Blackbelt to life in the most user-friendly way. Overall, the experience with MetaMask Snaps was pleasant as MetaMask Snaps are fairly easy to use. Given the novelty of MetaMask Snaps there are still some minor hiccups that occasionally caused us some headache during the hackathon but nothing really major.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is a great way to open source the development of wallet extensions and to enable diverse and individual solutions for end-users with different needs. As far as we know - MetaMask is the only wallet provider so far that supports custom plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Building with MetaMask Snaps was fairly easy. We started with one of the example projects that helped us to better understand the mechanics of MetaMask Snaps and then build on top of the example code. Building in MetaMask Snaps was fun but occasionally some bugs really challenged us, especially given the tight deadline during the hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the feature we always wished we had in our wallets.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Integrate with your hardware wallet:</strong> Enhance your security by connecting MetaMask to hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor from Portfolio, combining the convenience of MetaMask with the robust security of cold storage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Customize privacy settings:</strong> Adjust your privacy settings to your preference, including setting up a custom RPC for specific networks, managing connected sites, and reviewing permissions.
