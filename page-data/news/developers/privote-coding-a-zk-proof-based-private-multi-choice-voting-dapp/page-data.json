An external party wants you to sell your vote, in other words, they want you to vote for their choice, not your own, in exchange for some incentives. They will need proof of your vote if you succumb to their demand—often through a blockchain transaction receipt. While this might seem like an excellent opportunity if you're inclined to sell your vote, it undermines the integrity of the entire voting process.</p>\n<p>How can we enable voters to vote for their preferred candidates or issues while concealing their choices so that no one else can see them? The answer lies in one word: <strong>Encryption</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to develop a simple voting application—Privote—that utilizes encryption on the blockchain. When the time arrives, the votes are decrypted and tallied, and the results are published back to the blockchain while maintaining the voters' anonymity. The results are verified through a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof. Although not perfect, this example illustrates the underlying concepts.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Vitalik Buterin's <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html\">blog post</a> for an in-depth understanding of blockchain voting.</p>\n<p>Before we proceed, here is a breakdown of the main components of the Privote dapp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Smart Contract</strong>: This system stores multiple votes (ballots) and related data such as titles, available choices, and encrypted data.</li>\n<li><strong>Trusted Party</strong>: An off-chain server that decrypts the votes, calculates the results and publishes them on the blockchain. This server is termed the \"Trusted Party\" for a reason: it cannot publish incorrect results, either by computing inaccurately or by censoring messages.</li>\n<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: A platform where users connect their wallets and submit votes. There will also be a separate page for the \"admin\" to view the number of votes cast and manually release the results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To successfully build out Privote, we need to address two challenges:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable any voter to encrypt their vote while allowing the trusted party to decrypt it?</li>\n<li>Ensure the trusted party is reliable and can provide a ZK proof of the calculation, but what exactly are we proving?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenge 1: Enable any voter to encrypt their vote while allowing the trusted party to decrypt it</h2>\n<br />\nTo solve this, we can adopt asymmetric encryption. Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt. Multiple asymmetric encryption algorithms exist, including ElGamal, RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve techniques. For this tutorial, we’ll use the elliptic curve techniques, specifically the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](https://www.upguard.com/blog/diffie-hellman)(ECDH).\n<p>In ECDH, both the trusted party and each voter have their own key pairs (a public key and a private key), and the choice of elliptic curve, such as the <code>Baby Jubjub</code> curve used here for its suitability in zero-knowledge proofs, impacts the security and efficiency of cryptographic operations; the <code>Baby Jubjub</code> curve is defined by the equation <code>y^2 = x^3 + 168698 x 2 + x</code>, and key pairs are generated as specific pairs of points on this curve:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import {\n  packPoint,\n  unpackPoint,\n  mulPointEscalar,\n  Point,\n} from \"@zk-kit/baby-jubjub\";\nimport crypto from \"crypto\";\n\n// generates babyjubjub key pair that is compatible with our zokrates implementation\n\nexport const generateKeyPair = () => {\n// X and Y coordinates of the base point \n  const Base8: Point&#x3C;bigint> = [\n    16540640123574156134436876038791482806971768689494387082833631921987005038935n,\n    20819045374670962167435360035096875258406992893633759881276124905556507972311n,\n  ];\n\n  const privateKey = BigInt(`0x${crypto.randomBytes(32).toString(\"hex\")}`);\n\n  const publicKey = packPoint(mulPointEscalar(Base8, privateKey));\n\n  return {\n    privateKey,\n    publicKey,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the <code>generateKeyPair</code> function, I first create a secure random private key and then calculate the corresponding public key by performing a specific mathematical operation (scalar multiplication) on a predefined point on the curve, often called a base point or generator point. In the code, this point is named Base8. The result of this multiplication is another point on the curve, denoted by its X and Y coordinates. Subsequently, the point is formatted into a bigint for convenient use with the packPoint function.</p>\n<h3>Voting with decrypted choice</h3>\n<p>The voter creates a cipher by combining their private key with the trusted party's public key. This cipher is used to encrypt the vote. The smart contract then saves the encrypted vote and the voter's public key together.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export const encryptVote = async (vote: string) => {\n  const { publicKey: trustedPartypublicKey } = config;\n  const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPair();\n  const encryptedVote = await encryptData(\n    vote,\n    privateKey,\n    publicKey,\n    BigInt(trustedPartypublicKey)\n  );\n\n  return {\n    encryptedVote,\n    publicKey: publicKey.toString(),\n  };\n};\n\nexport const encryptData = (\n  data: string,\n  privateKey: bigint,\n  voterPublicKey: bigint,\n  trustedPartyKey: bigint\n) => {\n  // Compute the shared secret by multiplying the trusted party's public key by the private key.\n  const unpackedKey = unpackPoint(trustedPartyKey);\n  if (!unpackedKey) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid key\");\n  }\n  const sharedSecretPoint = mulPointEscalar(unpackedKey, privateKey);\n\n  let sharedSecret = sharedSecretPoint[0].toString(16);\n\n  // Pad the shared secret with zeros to make it 32 bytes long.\n  while (sharedSecret.length &#x3C; 64) {\n    sharedSecret = \"0\" + sharedSecret;\n  }\n\n  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(\n    \"aes-256-ctr\",\n    Buffer.from(sharedSecret, \"hex\"), // Use the first 32 bytes of the shared secret as the key.\n    Buffer.alloc(16, 0) // Use a zero-filled buffer as the IV.\n  );\n  let encrypted = cipher.update(data, \"utf8\", \"hex\");\n  encrypted += cipher.final(\"hex\");\n\n  return encrypted;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Decrypting votes and calculating results</h3>\n<p>The trusted party can create a cipher using their private key and each voter's public key to decrypt the data.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">export const publishResults = async (id: number) => {\n\t.....\n\t.....\n\n  const decryptedVotes = votes.map((vote) => {\n    const { encryptedVote, voter } = vote;\n    return decryptVote(encryptedVote, voter);\n  });\n\n  const results = calculateResult(decryptedVotes);\n// next send the calculate results to the blockchain with the zk proof \n\t ......\n\t ......\n};\n\nexport const decryptVote = (encryptedVote: string, voterPublicKey: string) => {\n  const { privateKey } = config;\n  const decryptedVote = decryptData(\n    encryptedVote,\n    BigInt(privateKey),\n    BigInt(voterPublicKey)\n  );\n\n  return decryptedVote;\n};\n\nexport const decryptData = (\n  encryptedData: string,\n  privateKey: bigint,\n  trustedPartyPublicKey: bigint\n) => {\n  const unpackedKey = unpackPoint(trustedPartyPublicKey);\n  if (!unpackedKey) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid key\");\n  }\n\n  const sharedSecretPoint = mulPointEscalar(unpackedKey, privateKey);\n\n  let sharedSecret = sharedSecretPoint[0].toString(16);\n\n  // Pad the shared secret with zeros to make it 32 bytes long.\n  while (sharedSecret.length &#x3C; 64) {\n    sharedSecret = \"0\" + sharedSecret;\n  }\n\n  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(\n    \"aes-256-ctr\",\n    Buffer.from(sharedSecret, \"hex\"), // Use the first 32 bytes of the shared secret as the key.\n    Buffer.alloc(16, 0) // Use a zero-filled buffer as the IV.\n  );\n  let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedData, \"hex\", \"utf8\");\n  decrypted += decipher.final(\"utf8\");\n  return decrypted;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the <code>generateKeyPair</code> function, we formatted the public key for easy use with the packPoint function. In the above code, with <code>unpackPoint</code>, we convert it back to its original form because we need to create a shared secret by combining the private key and the voter's public key. The shared secret is used to decrypt the vote.</p>\n<p>After decrypting each vote, calculating the results is easy! Just loop through the votes array and accumulate votes for a given choice.</p>\n<h2>Challenge 2: Ensure the trusted party is reliable and can provide ZK proof of the calculation. But what exactly are we proving?</h2>\n<br />\nIf you're unfamiliar with ZK proofs, they are a fairly complex yet fascinating piece of technology. ZK proofs are a method whereby one party can prove to another that they know a value without revealing any information about the value itself. Essentially, it's a way to validate the truth of something without sharing the details. Moreover, anyone can verify whether that proof is correct.\n<p>For our application, ideally, the trusted party should prove that they can take the encrypted votes, decrypt them, and calculate the number of votes each choice has received. In this case, the “secret” key is the trusted party's private key. For the sake of simplicity, we are just proving the ownership of a private key that matches the public key committed in the smart contract. As mentioned earlier, the votes use that key to generate a cipher to encrypt the vote.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, we’ll use <a href=\"https://zokrates.github.io/introduction.html\">ZoKrates</a>, a toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum. It helps you utilize verifiable computation in your dapp, from specifying your program in a high-level language to generating proofs of computation and verifying those proofs in Solidity.</p>\n<p>This is the simple ZK program I use:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-Python\">import \"ecc/proofOfOwnership\" as proofOfOwnership;\nfrom \"ecc/babyjubjubParams\" import BabyJubJubParams;\n\ndef main(field[2] pk, private field sk, BabyJubJubParams context) -> bool {\n  bool resp = proofOfOwnership(pk, sk,context);\n  return resp;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see in the arguments list, pk is a public argument, and sk is a private argument. context is also public. Only the prover - the trusted party, knows the sk, but the pk is known to anyone as it is in the smart contract. <code>context</code> is the parameters related to the curve we have picked to generate a key pair.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { initialize } from \"zokrates-js\";\n\nexport const generateProof = async (\n  privateKey: string,\n  publicKey: string[]\n) => {\n\n  const provider = await initialize();\n\n  const artifacts = await getZKP();\n\n  const program = Uint8Array.from(Buffer.from(artifacts.program, \"hex\"));\n\n  const { witness, output } = provider.computeWitness(program, [\n    ...publicKey.flat(),\n    privateKey,\n    \"8\",\n    \"168700\",\n    \"168696\",\n    \"168698\",\n    \"1\",\n    \"0\",\n    \"1\",\n  \"16540640123574156134436876038791482806971768689494387082833631921987005038935\",\n    \"20819045374670962167435360035096875258406992893633759881276124905556507972311\",\n  ]);\n\n  const provingKey = Uint8Array.from(\n    Buffer.from(artifacts.provingKey, \"hex\")\n  );\n\n  const proof = provider.generateProof(\n    program,\n    witness,\n    provingKey\n  );\n\n  return provider.utils.formatProof(proof)\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above snippet, I am using the ZoKrates JS SDK to generate a proof. The flow is similar to what is documented in the <a href=\"https://zokrates.github.io/introduction.html\">ZoKrates documentation</a>. Our goal is to use the ZoKrates program to generate a proof, so we’re passing three arguments to the computeWitness function: pk (a public argument), sk (a private argument), and context. These are used to create a witness, which is then used to generate proof.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering about this part of the argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">\"8\",\n    \"168700\",\n    \"168696\",\n    \"168698\",\n    \"1\",\n    \"0\",\n    \"1\",\n  \"16540640123574156134436876038791482806971768689494387082833631921987005038935\",\n    \"20819045374670962167435360035096875258406992893633759881276124905556507972311\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>context</code> provides the data related to the specific <code>Baby JubJub</code> curve we've been using throughout the application, as many curve variations can be used. Files such as the verification key, proving key and ZoKrates program are kept in a separate directory. I am using the function below to get those:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">const getZKP = async () => {\n  const zkPath = path.join(process.cwd(), \"src\", \"services\", \"zkp\");\n  const program = (await readFile(path.join(zkPath, \"./out\"))).toString(\"hex\");\n  const verificationKey = JSON.parse(\n    (await readFile(path.join(zkPath, \"./verification.key\"))).toString()\n  );\n  const provingKey = (\n    await readFile(path.join(zkPath, \"./proving.key\"))\n  ).toString(\"hex\");\n\n  return {\n    program,\n    provingKey,\n    verificationKey,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The snippet below is from the contract in which the contract accepts the results calculated by the trusted party. Only if the verification is successful does the contract accept the result. Outsiders can verify this by passing the pk (which is public and found in the contract) and the proof to the verifier function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bool\" data-meta=\"isVerified = verifyTx(proof, input);\">        if (!isVerified) {\n            revert(\"Invalid proof\");\n        }\n\n     // accept results\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>In this blog, we developed Privote, a ZK-based private voting system that keeps voters' choices confidential until the voting period ends. We used elliptic curve techniques to encrypt votes and demonstrated how to decrypt and tally them securely. We also implemented zero-knowledge proofs using ZoKrates to verify the voting process's integrity without revealing private information.</p>\n<p>This tutorial provides a basic understanding of creating secure and private voting systems on the blockchain. In the second part, we’ll build out the frontend and show you how users can connect and cast votes using the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/sdk/\">MetaMask SDK</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"Coding a ZK Proof-Based Private Multi-Choice Voting Dapp","metaDescription":"In this tutorial, we implement a ZK-based private voting system, Privote, in which no one can see the voters' choices until the voting has ended","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive our Newsletter","description":null,"portalId":"4795067","formId":"fbfea1e4-e214-4ab2-a98b-964f9a81695a","campaignId":null,"displayTitle":true,"width":null,"customClass":"newsletterOnNewsDetail","customId":null},"latest":{"internal":{"type":"ContentfulLayoutModuleContainer"},"contentful_id":"nO1tqQRjoUDUJfdg2B651","node_locale":"en-US","eyebrow":null,"headline":"Keep reading our latest stories","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Developers, security news, and more</p>"}},"modules":[{"node_locale":"en-US","contentful_id":"6iOGB8Fiab9ilS0jfZ8N5I","fontSize":null,"ctaLink":"/news/","displayText":"All posts","displayTextTreatment":null,"newTab":false,"buttonDisplay":false,"buttonGradient":false,"buttonSecondary":false,"hideButtonIcon":null,"eventLabel":null,"eventCategory":null,"socialLink":null,"showCaretRight":null,"buttonCaretDown":null,"launchDarklyFlag":null,"customClassName":null,"internal":{"type":"ContentfulCta"},"hubSpotForm":null,"embedHTML":null,"downloadBrowsers":null,"mobileCta":null,"alternativeCta":null},{"contentful_id":"1B0wZMveBTSiMJZWu4uunI","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulModuleContainer"},"title":"News > Latest Stories (3 items)","description":null,"numberOfItem":3,"columns":3,"columnType":null,"columnsOnTablet":null,"centerOnTablet":null,"columnsOnMobile":1,"centerOnMobile":null,"contentAlignment":"left","splitModules":false,"displayTitle":false,"isLiquiditySection":false,"isTrustBar":null,"gridModulesGap":"12px","loadMoreMode":null,"loadMoreCta":null,"carouselMode":null,"hasRegionSelector":null,"regionSelectorHeadline":null,"regionSelectorPopupTitle":null,"regionSelectorPopupText":null,"regionListKey":null,"extraData":null,"modules":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}]}],"cta":null,"backgroundColor":"default","displayHeadline":true,"headlineAlignCenter":true,"contentAlignCenter":false,"headlineMarginTop0":null,"paddingTop":"40px","sectionPadding":null,"noPaddingTop":null,"noPaddingBottom":false,"modulesMargin":null,"isTab":false,"moduleId":null,"customClass":"storiesOnNewsDetail","sideImage":null,"backgroundSize":"cover","backgroundImage":null},"latestStories":{"nodes":[{"contentful_id":"6H7l9QW6hN00NHBe1u2pOi","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"How gamers are empowered in web3","slug":"how-gamers-are-empowered-in-web3","subtitle":"Discover the builders who are transforming web3, in our More With MetaMask Partner Series.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 gaming players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ assets.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamers’ responsibility of security their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask is continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets.

Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis. By addressing these threats with speed, users are protected from having their data and wallets compromised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5VTAgVGte2yDTN49teJvWs/4fb806876d10786a3b2c7c1881453784/Threats_blocked_by_MetaMask_ChainPatrol_2024.png\" alt=\"Threats blocked by MetaMask and ChainPatrol Jan through Oct 2024\"></p>\n<p><em>Between January 1st 2024 and Oct 1st 2024,  ChainPatrol has blocked over 29,000 threats targeting Consensys brands including Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
