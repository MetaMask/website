A user managing multiple wallets and engaging opportunities across blockchain ecosystems will find themselves splitting their gas tokens across each of their wallets, reserving capital that would otherwise be for their investments in order to facilitate their digital assets and transactions. Beyond gas management, tokens transferred to a network where gas isn’t owned require the user to obtain gas before any further actions can be taken. Typically this involves the user accessing a Centralised Exchange to obtain and withdraw gas – subjecting the user to CEX withdrawal fees.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, the experience is flawed. There should not be a dependency on centralised exchanges for users to access Web3. Users should not have to worry about managing their gas and instead should be able to simply interact with decentralised systems. This is not to say that gas should not be required. Gas serves a fantastic purpose of rewarding operators of a network, as well as preventing spam/ddos. Gas should simply be more flexible. If a dApp or game developer has a native token, this token should suffice as a currency to pay for gas.</p>\n<p>With this philosophy in mind, CoinChoice was developed.</p>\n<p>CoinChoice lives within the user’s browser, supplementing every transaction with the ability to manage gas in a currency that the user desires. If the User prefers to hold USDC over ETH, then gas can be paid in USDC.</p>\n<p>CoinChoice’s MetaMask Snap further complements the experience. Directly within the MetaMask Browser Extension, users can top up their ETH in exchange for their chosen gas currency. This turns MetaMask into a solution that replaces the visit to a Centralised Exchange, consolidating and simplifying the Web3 experience, and enabling new Web3 users to familiarise themselves with a subset of systems without becoming overwhelmed by the growing abundance of services and platforms.</p>\n<p><img

implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>CoinChoice is a MetaMask &#x26; Browser Extension that gives you choice over which coins are used to pay gas.</p>\n<h4>Packages</h4>\n<br /> \n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>backend</code>: A NestJS Web Server responsible for</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simulating transactions against the Tenderly API and 0x Quote API to yield gas estimates in chosen currency</li>\n<li>receive and syndicate messages between the client’s Metamask Snap and Browser Extension</li>\n<li>receive meta-tx to forward to relayer contracts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>browser-extension</code>: A Browser Extension powered by the Plasmo Framework</p>\n<ul>\n<li>intercepts RPC requests to MetaMask in order to inject swaps to ETH for gas financing</li>\n<li>offers a popup where Gas Coin can be selected</li>\n<li>offers a popup for Token management powered by Cypher Onboarding SDK</li>\n<li>all data is submitted to backend service where Blockchain Interactions and Simulations are managed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>contracts</code> : Smart Contracts that power relaying meta-transactions to facilitate swaps on 0x Protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>frpc</code>: A package to leverage the Fluence Network’s fRPC Gateway</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>meta-mask</code>: A package that contains a React.js Site and assocated MetaMask Snap.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Snap is responsible for offering ETH Swaps directly within the MetaMask interface, by showing a message “Need ETH?”</li>\n<li>The Snap works by making a request to the backend so that a message is forwarded to the client’s browser-extension, enabling an experience where the MetaMask Snap can initiate the Browser Extension</li>\n<li>The associated Site is used to enable MetaMask Snap Installation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Technical Setup</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>CoinChoice is browser extension that supplements transactions with the opportunity to top up gas with a chosen currency.</p>\n<p>The browser extension is designed to prompt the user to pay gas in their selected currency prior to each transaction.</p>\n<p>If a user accepts, a meta-transcation is captured to convert an estimated amount of the chosen token to ETH.</p>\n<p>This meta-transaction is forwarded to the backend service that forwards it to the relayer Smart Contract where it is executed.</p>\n<p>Once the meta-transaction is settled, the user’s original transaction is prompted and accessible due to the deposit of the appropriate amount of gas.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Snap is designed to forward a transaction that would otherwise be isolated within the MetaMask extension to the CoinChoice Extension.\nIt does this by</p>\n<ol>\n<li>submitting a request with the transaction details to the backend serivce</li>\n<li>the backend will then forward the transaction data to the browser extension over a websocket connection</li>\n<li>once the browser extension receives this websocket message, it initiates its flow of topping up an automatically estimated amount of gas in exchange for a selected currency.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Backend as a Message Bus</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>CoinChoice took the approach of using a backend as a message bus between the two frontend components due to the sandboxed nature of the MetaMask Snap.</p>\n<p>The Snap code isolation prevents communication to frontend components that reside in contexts outside of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>However, Snaps can facilitate server-side requests, and therefore a backend service capable of managing user sessions can be used to pass messages between the frontend contexts.</p>\n<p>An example of this can be demonstrated through our source code.</p>\n<p>Within the MetaMask Snap, we submit a request to the server.</p>\n<p><em>See <a

I sought team members through EthDenver’s Discord. It was in Denver that all team members actually met in person. Each of us has a unique skill set to bring to the table that enabled us to work very well together. Disputes and problems were faced head-on, and blame and success were shared equally between all team members. Through the hacking experience, the team can safely say that it was a pleasure working together. If there are opportunities that arise out of this endeavour, we’d all be available to support each other.</p>\n<p>As for the team’s experience, Achim is the best example of an engineer that intersects economics and mathematics. Achim has developed a DeFi protocol named <a href=\"https://www.1delta.io/\">1Delta.io</a> that is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with leveraged digital asset management. This experience was vital in developing and deploying CoinChoice’s Smart Contracts with production-grade security.</p>\n<p>Andre comes from a Web2 background and was therefore the perfect candidate to develop and manage server-side processes that are imperative to managing and executing meta-transactions, as well as other application data. Andrew leads <a href=\"https://www.webeleven.com.br/\">Web Eleven</a>, a Web2 agency in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Christie supported the team non-technically through deck creation, branding, content, and project management. Christie leads <a href=\"https://www.webdoodle.com.au/\">Web Doodle</a>, a Web2 agency in Australia.</p>\n<p>As for me, I have a background in solutions architecture and engineering. I direct a Web3 startup named <a href=\"https://usher.so\">Usher.so</a> where we’ve developed a partner programs platform, and are subsequently exploring new decentralised infrastructure to support such a platform. While being responsible for front-end development and solutions architecture, I managed to bring my experience coordinating a project and team to the EthDenver hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is positioning itself to be among the first applications a user interacts with to engage Web3. By enabling the extensibility of the user experience, MetaMask allows developers to introduce their value proposition at an early and familiar touchpoint. This becomes more important once there is a consolidation in gateways to Web3 specifically for the next generation of Web3 users. This is analogous to the consolidation of gateways to the internet we all are already familiar with, whereby end user facing applications like Social Networks or Search Engines have become the first point of interaction for many internet users.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps enables more contextual experiences. An example outcome could be a Snap that functions differently based on the dApp that the MetaMask Wallet is interacting with. By enabling developers to build upon the overlay user interface to Web3, more interesting developments can be incorporated that fundamentally change the way Web3 is interacted with. Unlike a dApp that enables a UI for a specific protocol, Snap developers can alter the way all protocols are engaged, as the innovation lives within the wallet that enables these interactions.</p>\n<p>Finally, MetaMask Snaps that aim to increase the transparency of transactions, simplify Web3 interactions, and provide additional security to end-users will fundamentally make Web3 safer and more viable for a vast number of users.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to raw source code that implements MetaMask Snaps to gather deeper insight into how these new capabilities function. The MetaMask Snaps team has done a great job in making public well-developed code that demonstrates MetaMask Snaps within a project. While the documentation gives an overview of the features, the source code illustrates how these features are implemented and manipulated.</p>\n<p>Reduce expectations for what is capable within the Snaps Framework during early development stages. While MetaMask Snaps will eventually enable the full extensibility of MetaMask, access to different components within the Snaps Framework will be released gradually. There’s a balancing act that MetaMask will need to consider when maximising end-user security, so some features included in early builds may be re-considered. If your solution required more access to the user’s browser context, consider referring to the CoinChoice source code to develop a Browser Extension that is triggered by an action within a MetaMask Snap.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Reach out to the MetaMask team</a>.

The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security MetaMask offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. MetaMask offers Yooldo gamers the tools they need to protect against digital threats of every kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to begin your web3 gaming journey.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked. As MetaMask’s phishing detection provider, <a href=\"https://chainpatrol.io/\">ChainPatrol</a> recognized the power of a blocklist approach early on.</p>\n<p>While traditional takedowns are still important, in the worst cases it can take over a day to remove a phishing site entirely. MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1H51TkYG1NHQHa0K9CHsNT/e983121c477c4cde79958c93baaab5be/MetaMask_takedown_time.jpg\" alt=\"MetaMask takedown time\">\n<em>Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of detection on MetaMask.</em></p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis. By addressing these threats with speed, users are protected from having their data and wallets compromised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5VTAgVGte2yDTN49teJvWs/4fb806876d10786a3b2c7c1881453784/Threats_blocked_by_MetaMask_ChainPatrol_2024.png\" alt=\"Threats blocked by MetaMask and ChainPatrol Jan through Oct 2024\"></p>\n<p><em>Between January 1st 2024 and Oct 1st 2024,  ChainPatrol has blocked over 29,000 threats targeting Consensys brands including Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem.
