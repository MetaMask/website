As part of this partnership, MetaMask, Web3’s most used decentralized wallet, and Infura, the number one platform for blockchain infrastructure, have integrated StarkNet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#zk-video\">ZK-rollup</a>. The network operates as an L2 network on top of Ethereum that enables dapps to achieve scalability for their computational needs without compromising Ethereum's composability and security.</p>\n<p>MetaMask has created a <a href=\"https://app.starknet-snap.consensys-solutions.net/\">StarkNet snap</a> (only available in <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-metamask-flask-enables-developers-to-build-the-latest-technical-innovations-in-web3/\">MetaMask Flask</a>) for developers to build on the network, while Infura is offering a <a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/infura-starknet-waitlist\">private beta</a> for developers to experience the power of the Infura network on StarkNet.&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>Infura now supports StarkNet</h5>\n<p>Infura has added StarkNet to the Infura platform for faster and cheaper transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem and to ensure developers have choices for the networks they prefer for their projects.The benefits developers can expect from building with StarkNet on Infura include:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Scalability and low fees:</strong> Features like transaction aggregation enable efficient scalability and reduced gas costs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Security: </strong>Verification of STARK proofs securing dapp transactions take place on the Ethereum mainnet.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> StarkNet provides fast finality.</li><li><strong>Self-custody: </strong>StarkNet is non-custodial, involving none of the cost, risks and effort involved in maintaining a traditional custodial system.</li><li><strong>Easier builds and better end-user experience: </strong>General-purpose smart contracts promote the deployment of any business logic and the network’s interoperable nature gives end-users a seamless experience.</li></ul>\n<p>Developers can now access the StarkNet network via Infura API endpoints with support for all RPC methods. This means developers can implement their business logic of choice in a smart contract, and deploy it permissionlessly on StarkNet.</p>\n<p>\"Infura is one of the world's leading blockchain development suite. As such, StarkNet - the leading validity L2 on Ethereum, sees strategic importance in providing the growing ecosystem of StarkNet access to the best toolset for querying and analyzing the state of StarkNet. This is an incredibly significant step forward for StarkNet.\" - Eli Ben-Sasson, Co-Founder and President at StarkWare</p>\n<p>Right now, Infura is making StarkNet available to a small group of users through their private beta.

With more than 17,000 dapps choosing it as their preferred method for users to connect, MetaMask is the key to connect to Web3. With such a committed developer community and so much desire for innovation, MetaMask created and released a system that allows any developer to build, permissionlessly, on top of the product: MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps provides a way for developers to expand the capabilities of MetaMask and enable new functionality for dapps; for example, connecting to a non-EVM network like StarkNet, and a myriad of other uses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Snaps are currently only available in the development build—MetaMask Flask—which developers will need to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/flask/\">install in their browser</a> to interact with the integration. <em>Please note that MetaMask Flask should be installed in a separate browser profile from MetaMask stable.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Until now, StarkNet hasn’t been directly compatible with MetaMask due to its use of a different address and account format than Ethereum. In other words: <em>not </em><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#evm\"><em>EVM</em></a><em> compatible</em>. This Layer 2 snap is the first of its kind to enable ZK-rollup support, giving users wider access to permissionless decentralized networks for fast, low-cost applications.</p>\n<p>The StarkNet snap derives StarkNet keys from your MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase, allowing you to manage assets on StarkNet. Without having to create another account, you can simply use the StarkNet snap to facilitate:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul><li>Deploying StarkNet accounts</li><li>Making transactions on StarkNet</li><li>Interacting with StarkNet smart contracts</li></ul>\n<p>If you’re a developer and want to get started, make sure you have <a href=\"https://metamask.io/flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a> installed and then install the StarkNet snap <a href=\"https://app.starknet-snap.consensys-solutions.net/\">here</a>.&nbsp; Learn more about installing and using the Starknet snap in our <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-integrates-starkware-into-first-of-its-kind-zk-rollup-snap/\">guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Please note that StarkNet is still in alpha and you may experience service interruptions.

across various platforms is crucial. Recognizing this need, MetaMask is thrilled to introduce a new feature within the MetaMask Portfolio to significantly streamline the process of transferring assets between centralized exchange (CEX) platforms like Coinbase and Binance and MetaMask.</p>\n<p>For many users, the digital asset landscape is scattered across multiple wallets and accounts, creating a fragmented experience. The challenge of moving assets from one platform to another has often been a cumbersome process, fraught with the risks of copying and pasting addresses incorrectly and exposing oneself to potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>MetaMask's latest update aims to address this issue head-on, offering a solution that not only enhances user experience but also bolsters security.</p>\n<h4><strong>Instant transfer of assets from exchanges to into your MetaMask wallet</strong></h4>\n<p>With the new integration, users can now effortlessly link their Coinbase or Binance accounts to their MetaMask wallet directly from the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard. MetaMask will never have access to exchange login credentials nor share any MetaMask wallet addresses with any third parties. Check out the below tutorial to see how it easy it is to connect to an exchange and transfer funds:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_wNpeCZubE?si=ZiWR5woPiWo4iS1D\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This seamless connection allows for the instant transfer of assets between accounts, eliminating the need for the manual entry of addresses. Additionally, for those with bank accounts linked to their Coinbase or Binance accounts, purchasing crypto directly into their MetaMask wallet has never been easier. Here's what's new:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Direct Integration</strong>: This feature enables users to transfer assets between their Coinbase or Binance accounts and MetaMask with just a few clicks, bypassing the cumbersome process of copying and pasting addresses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fiat to Crypto Onramp</strong>: Users can now directly convert fiat to crypto in their MetaMask account through their linked bank account on CEXs, streamlining the process of adding funds to their wallets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's important to note that, initially, this feature will support transfers from Coinbase or Binance accounts only, with plans to expand to other exchanges soon. No fees will be charged when transferring assets from exchanges to MetaMask, but a nominal transaction fee of 0.25% will be applied when transferring from MetaMask to centralized exchanges, ensuring the sustainability of this valuable service. Network gas fees also apply.</p>\n<h4><strong>Improving web3 UX with MetaMask step-by-step</strong></h4>\n<p>This update is a step forward in MetaMask's mission to simplify the crypto experience, making it more accessible and secure for users worldwide. By bridging the gap between self-custodial and centralized platforms, MetaMask is not just solving the fragmentation issue within the ecosystem but also paving the way for a more integrated and user-friendly digital asset environment.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"Transfers from CEX now available in MetaMask Portfolio ","metaDescription":"MetaMask's new CEX transfer feature simplifies asset transfers between centralized exchanges, enhancing both security and user experience.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"4uNWsEJpmKwVHI5EaNYsAQ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"More With MetaMask: Mendi Finance Snap","slug":"more-with-metamask-partner-series-mendi-finance","subtitle":"The More With MetaMask Partner Series explores builders who are transforming web3.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
