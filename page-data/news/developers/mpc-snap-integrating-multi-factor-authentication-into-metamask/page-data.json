When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed MetaMask Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private key.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads / interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The rest of the process can be further split into two major tasks:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Getting the MPC SDKs running in the MetaMask Snaps SES environment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you’re familiar with how MetaMask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the MetaMask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers / byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the MetaMask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library / specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private keys.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows MetaMask Snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>I think MetaMask Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting overall.</p>\n<p><strong>What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through MetaMask Snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to Web3.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>In general, I think MetaMask Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for MetaMask Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping MetaMask Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
