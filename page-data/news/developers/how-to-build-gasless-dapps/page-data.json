Each of these processes comes with a cost, which we refer to as the \"Gas Cost.\" But what is Gas?</p>\n<p>Gas is a unit that measures the computational work required to perform transactions or execute smart contracts on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum. Gas is crucial because it regulates and prioritizes transactions within the network. Since blockchain networks have limited processing capacity, gas fees serve two key purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incentivizing Validators or Miners: Gas fees reward validators or miners for processing and confirming transactions, ensuring the network remains secure and operational.</li>\n<li>Preventing system abuse: By imposing a cost on every operation, it discourages spam attacks and malicious use of computational resources, safeguarding the network from potential abuse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considering that gas is the \"fuel\" needed for a blockchain to function, the idea of a gasless dapp might seem contradictory—like trying to run a car without fuel. So, how can a blockchain operate without gas?</p>\n<p>In reality, gas does not disappear. Instead, the responsibility for paying the gas fees shifts from the user to another party—either the service provider or the dapp itself. This approach allows users to interact with the dapp without directly incurring gas costs, enhancing user experience and accessibility.</p>\n<h2><strong>Implementing gasless transactions with ERC-4337 and Paymasters smart contract</strong></h2>\n<br />\n<p>Typically, users are responsible for paying gas fees, which can increase the cost of their transactions based on the gas price. In a gasless dapp, however, the gas fee is covered by a third party, who signs and pays for the transaction on behalf of the user. This third party is often a relayer, though in some cases, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/account-abstraction-past-present-future/\">account abstraction</a> mechanisms are used instead.</p>\n<p>There are two types of standards used to make a gasless dapp possible: ERC-4337 and ERC-2771. Let's take a closer look at them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.erc4337.io/\"><strong>ERC-4337</strong></a>: This standard introduces account abstraction, allowing Ethereum accounts to behave like smart contracts. It enables greater flexibility in how transactions are initiated and authorized, particularly by decoupling transaction initiation from traditional Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This allows for more complex transaction workflows, such as bundling multiple actions into one transaction or enabling programmable wallets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771\"><strong>ERC-2771</strong></a>: This standard introduces a meta-transaction framework, allowing users to interact with dapps without needing ETH to pay for gas fees directly. A trusted forwarder handles the transaction on behalf of the user, and the dapp reimburses the forwarder for the gas costs. This simplifies onboarding new users who don't have ETH in their wallets but still want to interact with dapps.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case, we will use <a href=\"http://permissionless.js\">permissionless.js</a> and ERC-4337 to create a custom paymaster with accounts that cover creating clients (public and Pimlico paymaster clients), setting up a smart account, and defining custom logic for the paymaster. But first, let’s understand what a paymaster is.</p>\n<p>A paymaster is a specialized smart contract in Ethereum's account abstraction system (like ERC-4337). It acts as a sponsor for transaction gas fees, enabling users to pay in tokens other than ETH or even have the fees covered entirely. The paymaster decides whether to sponsor the gas cost based on custom logic, providing more flexibility for dapps, where the transaction cost can be handled by a third party, making the process easier for users without needing them to hold ETH.</p>\n<p>1. First, let’s create a <code>utils/index.ts</code> file where we’re going to store our code.</p>\n<p>2. Create the public client (optional): this is the Pimlico paymaster client that will be used to interact with the SimpleSmartAccount:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { createPublicClient, http } from \"viem\";\nimport { createPimlicoClient } from \"permissionless/clients/pimlico\";\nimport { lineaSepolia } from \"viem/chains\";\n\nexport const publicClient = createPublicClient({\n\tchain: lineaSepolia,\n\ttransport: http(\"&#x3C;https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia>\"),\n})\n\nconst pimlicoUrl = &#x3C;https://api.pimlico.io/v2/sepolia/rpc?apikey=${apiKey}>\n\nexport const pimlicoClient = createPimlicoClient({\n\ttransport: http(pimlicoUrl),\n\tentryPoint: {\n\t\taddress: entryPoint07Address,\n\t\tversion: \"0.7\",\n\t},\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>3. Create an account: This can be any of the accounts supported by permissionless.js or custom accounts conforming to the interface. For this example, we'll use a <code>SimpleSmartAccount</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { toSimpleSmartAccount } from \"permissionless/accounts\";\nimport { privateKeyToAccount } from \"viem/accounts\";\n\nconst simpleAccount = await toSimpleSmartAccount({\n\tclient: publicClient,\n\towner: privateKeyToAccount(\"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\"),\n\tentryPoint: {\n\t\taddress: entryPoint07Address,\n\t\tversion: \"0.7\",\n\t}\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>4. Create the Smart Account client with custom paymaster logic: When creating the <code>smartAccountClient</code>, we can pass in a <code>sponsorUserOperation</code> function that will be called before a user operation is signed and sent. This function must return the <code>paymasterAndData</code>, <code>preVerificationGas</code>, <code>verificationGasLimit</code>, and <code>callGasLimit</code> fields.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { createSmartAccountClient } from \"permissionless\";\nimport { lineaSepolia } from \"viem/chains\";\n\nconst smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({\n\taccount,\n\tchain: lineaSepolia,\n\tbundlerTransport: http(pimlicoUrl),\n\tpaymaster: pimlicoClient,\n\tuserOperation: {\n\t\testimateFeesPerGas: async () => {\n\t\t\treturn (await pimlicoClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast\n\t\t},\n\t}\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>5. Send a transaction: You can now send transactions as normal. The sponsorUserOperation function will be called before each transaction is signed and sent, applying the custom paymaster logic you have set.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">const txHash = await smartAccountClient.sendTransaction({\n\tto: \"YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS\",\n\tvalue: parseEther(\"0.1\")\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have set up a smart account integrated with custom paymaster logic using permissionless.js and the Pimlico client. This setup allows seamless interaction with the blockchain while automating gas fees and transaction management through the paymaster. Now, it’s time for you to try this.</p>\n<h2>Security considerations for gasless dapps</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Trusted relayers and paymasters</strong>: Since gasless dapps rely on third-party relayers or paymasters to handle transactions on behalf of users, it’s crucial to ensure that these entities are trusted and secure. A malicious or compromised relayer could alter or block transactions. Use reputable services and implement fallback mechanisms in case the relayer fails.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Transaction integrity</strong>: When using a relayer, the transaction might be signed by the relayer on behalf of the user. Make sure that the relayer does not alter the transaction in any malicious way before submitting it to the blockchain. Ensure the smart contract or logic verifies that the transaction details (e.g., destination address, value) match what the user intended.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Paymaster logic security</strong>: Since the paymaster determines whether to sponsor gas fees based on custom logic, ensure that this logic is secure and doesn’t allow unintended parties to exploit the paymaster to execute free transactions. Implement robust rules and checks to avoid abuse or unintended sponsorship of transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Smart contract audits</strong>: Gasless dapps often involve complex smart contracts for account abstraction or meta-transactions. Regularly audit the smart contracts for security vulnerabilities, as these contracts manage transaction flow and fees. Contract vulnerabilities could lead to potential exploits where attackers manipulate transaction flows.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Gas price manipulation</strong>: In a gasless dapp, where a paymaster covers gas fees, attackers might attempt to manipulate gas prices to increase the costs borne by the paymaster. Include safeguards in the paymaster logic to cap gas fees and reject excessively costly operations.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Secure storage of private keys</strong>: When using solutions like permissionless.js or Pimlico, ensure that the private keys used to sign transactions are stored securely. Never hard-code private keys in your application, and consider using secure environments like hardware wallets or secure enclaves for key management.</p>\n<h2>Unlocking the potential of gasless dapps</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Gasless dapps are an innovative way to enhance user experience on dapps by offloading gas fees to a third party. By utilizing standards like ERC-4337, developers can create more flexible and user-friendly applications that lower the barriers to entry for new users.</p>\n<p>The provided code snippets demonstrate how to implement gasless transactions using <a href=\"http://permissionless.js\">permissionless.js</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/reference/clients/smartAccountClient\">Pimlico clients</a>, and custom paymaster logic.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
