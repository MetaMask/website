Okonkwo","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"kingsley-okonkwo"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>HyperPlay, a gaming infrastructure company, has built a web3 native game store that distributes web2 and web3 games. Their mission is to enhance the web3 gaming user experience by integrating interoperability of digital assets, on-chain reputation, and seamless wallet integration into web3 gaming. Currently, HyperPlay has a collection of 67 games in their store, featuring titles from renowned gaming studios such as Square Enix, Animoca, and others. HyperPlay’s store also includes the entire games library from Epic Games and GOG.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">platform</a> is cross-chain and supports games built on Ethereum and every EVM chain, Cosmos, Solana, Starkware, and Sui, with plans to expand support to additional blockchains. Additionally, HyperPlay is cross-platform compatible, offering support for operating systems including Windows, Steam Deck, MacOS, and Linux. Native Windows games can also be launched on MacOS, Linux, or SteamDeck using HyperPlay’s integration of gaming compatibility libraries.</p>\n<p>This case study explores how the MetaMask Developer suite empowers HyperPlay to achieve its mission of bringing immersive gaming experience to web3 players.</p>\n<h2>The challenge: Enable seamless web3 wallet support for game developers and immersive gameplay for users</h2>\n<p>To meet their objective of immersive gameplay and interoperability in web3 gaming, HyperPlay recognizes the necessity for players to use the same wallets across different games and not be forced to create a new wallet for each game that they play. Moreover, to streamline new player onboarding, wallets must be configured so that players aren't forced to exit the game to a separate website to access the web3 aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>A common approach in the current web3 gaming landscape to address this issue involves the use of embedded proprietary wallets. Here, game developers are tasked with creating their own single-game siloed wallets to provide a seamless in-game experience. However, this poses a significant challenge for developers and players, as these wallets increase the friction for playing the game for players who already have a wallet, and they also undermine the interoperability between games because it is difficult to use the assets in these wallets outside of the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2fbSb1kAPlSO8YisT3HxvW/abe9c2b3bc9cc65a1131a21c8c65a172/image__1_.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay image 1\"></p>\n<p>Furthermore, game developers prefer to spend time designing games rather than developing custom wallets and infrastructure with multiple SDK and wallet integrations to ensure cross-chain support for their games.</p>\n<h2>The solution: Improved UX and interoperability with the MetaMask Wallet API and SDK</h2>\n<p>By integrating with the MetaMask Wallet API and SDK, HyperPlay is building a seamless onboarding experience for players. When players encounter their first on-chain transaction without a wallet, they will be able to sign up and onboard a MetaMask wallet in-game. An overlay is displayed on top of the game, and the MetaMask onboarding flow is streamed to the user using graphical libraries like OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan. User interactions are streamed back, leading to calls to the HyperPlay wallet API, which are then directed to the MetaMask Wallet API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3ZIJiLFgbzZDArIxOxTIVi/e3ff6920c115a28667120fb4285ad161/image__1_.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay image 2\"></p>\n<p>Developers don’t need to embed an SDK or include any sort of code or package inside their game either. All they need to do is call the HyperPlay API, which then routes these calls to the MetaMask Wallet API, serving as a communication library for MetaMask.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay was also able to leverage MetaMask Wallet API for authentication and sign-in processes, facilitating transactions in games’ marketplaces for buying and selling gaming items, and offering game developers access to a vast user base with significant liquidity—all without the burden of game developers having to manage the wallet integration on their own.</p>\n<h2>Building new onboarding experiences for web3 users with MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay recently introduced <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> to their game store, with the next step focused on Snaps adoption by game developers. The Snaps integration aims to further enhance the user and developer experience on HyperPlay as the games can prompt users to use specific Snaps beneficial to their gameplay.</p>\n<p>The first use of Snaps on HyperPlay involves non-EVM Snaps that enable players to interact with games on non-EVM blockchains through MetaMask. This feature helps developers of games on non-EVM blockchains to access MetaMask’s vast user base of web3 natives and the liquidity in their wallets. It is also beneficial for players who want to play games available on non-EVM chains but lack knowledge of those blockchains. If the player does not have the required Snap installed, the game can prompt the Snap installation and allow the player to continue the game.</p>\n<p>Another area HyperPlay is investigating is Account Abstraction and Contract Account Allowances. This focus is especially relevant for games generating a high volume of transaction requests daily. Implementing Contract Account Allowances can be beneficial as conducting numerous transactions in-game can negatively impact user experience and security.</p>\n<p>An Account Abstraction Snap can offer a solution by allowing players to deposit a specific amount into a contract account, this account can then use session keys to grant and revoke auto-spendable allowances to particular games, up to a user-defined threshold.</p>\n<h2>Get started with MetaMask Developer today</h2>\n<p>Are you a developer building consumer dapps?</p>\n<p>MetaMask Developer suite, comprising the MetaMask Wallet API, SDK, Web3 service APIs, and Snaps, offers a comprehensive set of tools for onboarding millions of the web’s most engaged users.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">developer portal</a> to learn more about our offerings.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"How MetaMask Developer Suite Powers HyperPlay's Game Store","metaDescription":"Learn how the MetaMask Developer suite was used to build HyperPlay’s web3 game store.

The methods supported by the Wallet API are organized into several related  categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ethereum API</strong>: This category encompasses the standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API methods as defined by EIP 1193, the foundation for Ethereum blockchain interactions.</li>\n<li><strong>MetaMask</strong>: These are MetaMask-specific methods that provide functionality not necessarily supported by other wallets, offering unique features available only to MetaMask users.</li>\n<li><strong>Snaps</strong>: This category includes methods specific to the Snaps feature, allowing for a broader range of interactions within the MetaMask ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted</strong>: Methods under this category require explicit permission from the MetaMask user, obtained through the <code>wallet_requestPermissions</code> call, ensuring a secure and user-consented experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile</strong>: This category is dedicated to mobile-specific methods that are not supported by the desktop extension, tailoring the user experience for mobile users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a comprehensive overview of all methods supported by the MetaMask Wallet API, including their parameters, expected responses, and the categories they belong to, please refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/json-rpc-api/\">interactive API reference</a>.</p>\n<p>While developers have the option to integrate with MetaMask directly through the API, we recommend utilizing the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">MetaMask SDK</a> for an enhanced and seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>Building upon the MetaMask API, the SDK is a comprehensive library designed to facilitate a reliable, secure, and smooth connection between your dapp and both the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile. This SDK allows for a variety of <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/concepts/sdk/#benefits-of-metamask-sdk\">connection methods to MetaMask</a> across different dapp platforms, eliminating the dependency on third-party libraries for integration.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the MetaMask SDK enhances the development experience by enabling automatic detection of the MetaMask wallet through EIP-6963. This eliminates the need for manual configuration or detection methods, thereby simplifying the initial setup process for developers and users alike.</p>\n<h2>Reasons to use the MetaMask Wallet API</h2>\n<p>Using the MetaMask Wallet API offers five key advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access to MetaMask-specific methods</strong>: The Wallet API provides developers with several MetaMask-specific, battle-tested methods that enable tracking of specific tokens and assets, permission requests, redirection of onboarded users back to your dapp, and simplification of the connect &#x26; sign experience, among others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access to an established power user base</strong>: Developers gain access to MetaMask's extensive user base, which includes over 100M installs and 30M monthly active users, and processes 100M monthly transactions through more than 17,000 connected web3 dapps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cross-chain support</strong>: MetaMask supports all EVM chains and can be extended to support other chains through MetaMask Snaps, which facilitates transactions and dapps on networks such as Sui, Solana, Bitcoin, Algorand, Cosmos, Tezos, and Polkadot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unified, cross-platform support</strong>: The MetaMask SDK supports dapps across JavaScript, iOS, Android, and game engines, allowing developers to integrate with MetaMask using just a few lines of code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integration with popular libraries</strong>: The MetaMask SDK integrates with popular web3 connection libraries like Wagmi, web3onboard, web3 react, ethers.js, web3 auth, WalletConnect, and other wallet-agnostic connection libraries, fitting seamlessly into existing workflows.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Build with the MetaMask Wallet API to onboard millions of web3 power users to your dapp</h2>\n<p>Connecting with the MetaMask Wallet API offers an unparalleled opportunity to tap into a vast network of web3 enthusiasts and power users.

Thankfully, there are guidelines like the <a href=\"https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices\">Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices</a> that give developers a solid understanding to make their projects as safe as possible for users.</p>\n<h2>Security guidelines for MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<p>One such new primitive is <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>, an open-source system that enables users to safely extend MetaMask's functionality, offering new wallet experiences. At its core, a Snap is a JavaScript program operating inside MetaMask in an isolated environment.</p>\n<p>With MetaMask Snaps comes a variety of new and exciting functions for your MetaMask wallet which inevitably introduces more complexity and therefore more attack surface. Earlier, we introduced the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/navigating-the-security-landscape-of-metamask-snaps/\">MetaMask Trust Model</a> for a more secure Snap development and teased common vulnerabilities in Snaps.</p>\n<p>This is the groundwork for the next step we take to create a knowledge base for all things Snap security. With builders and auditors in mind, we assembled the <a href=\"https://consensys.github.io/snap-security-essentials\">Snap Security Essentials</a> explaining the MetaMask Trust Model, the top vulnerabilities, best practices, and more. It is a one-stop shop with resources and knowledge, builders, and auditors need to create a safe Snap space. <br>\n<br>\nIt is maintained by Consensys Diligence, with contributions from our friends in the broader Ethereum and security community. 💚</p>\n<h2>What you can expect from Snap Security Essentials</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>General philosophy:</strong> To understand Snaps means to understand the MetaMask Trust Model. As summarized in our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/navigating-the-security-landscape-of-metamask-snaps/\">earlier post</a> users trust MetaMask but not the dapp! Given that paradigm, there are logical consequences for Snap secure building and auditing that we condensed into general philosophy guidelines.</li>\n<li><strong>Top 10 Snap vulnerabilities:</strong> We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the audit reports for all the Snaps in the Snaps Marketplace up to Oct 23. We classified the issues and identified a clear top 10. For every vulnerability essentials provides you with a detailed description, misuse scenarios, and ways to prevent them.</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge base:</strong> This is the right place to get in the weeds of Snap building and securing. Here, we dropped our latest insights and findings so you have all Snap Security alpha in one place. This is an ever-growing treasure of knowledge as we invite the community to contribute and share.</li>\n<li><strong>Experimental tools:</strong> Security is hard and takes time. We constantly think about ways to make life easier for your inner security engineer and publish new tools for you to test. Our latest experiment is SnipGuardian which is designed to visualize a Snap's capabilities, give code insights, and detect common vulnerabilities. This tool is the Swiss Army Knife of Snap Security. As a Snap user, it can help you to understand the risk profile of a Snap before installing it. As a developer, it can help you to identify common pitfalls and vulnerabilities in your Snap and enhance the robustness of your code. As a Snap security auditor, it can help you to enhance your auditing process and identify common vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Snap Security for and from the community</h2>\n<p>We are here to support you with audits, tools, and insights. The Snap Security Essentials launched in its first version and serves as a go-to place for everything Snap Security. This is an open project and we invite everyone to contribute.

This attack compromised their npm credentials. npm, or Node Package Manager, is a tool for importing open-source software libraries, broadly used across the web development industry, as well as web3.</p>\n<p>This attack allowed a malicious version of the library in question to be published. This library is included in a live-updating manner via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in many web apps in the Ethereum ecosystem. This resulted in malicious code being injected into those web apps.</p>\n<h2>How do we prevent this? LavaMoat.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat\">LavaMoat</a> is a set of tools built specifically to help address the software supply chain security issues web application developers face.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat offers protections against supply chain attacks at three different points in the software development lifecycle: <strong>at the time of dependency install</strong> (when you’re importing all those libraries), <strong>at build time</strong> (when the app is being prepared for serving over the Internet), <strong>and at runtime</strong> (when the built application is running).</p>\n<p>LavaMoat is unique in its <strong>runtime protections</strong>. There are other tools that can be used during development, such as <a href=\"https://snyk.io/\">snyk.io</a>, which only provides warnings of known vulnerabilities, or <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>, which provides more comprehensive code analysis, and does not wait for experts to report findings to a central database. <strong>These scanning tools perform an invaluable role</strong>, and we recommend you use <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>’s GitHub Integration.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>they are unable to provide any runtime guarantees.</strong> For this reason, we find using them alone to be insufficient.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat’s security protections derive from <strong>only delegating specified capabilities</strong> to dependencies of your application.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? Well, read on, and check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Bz0DYga1k&#x26;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation\">Devcon 6 talk</a> for a deeper understanding of how LavaMoat works and how it is used.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5Bz0DYga1k?si=xqyZEWdI7k1arwZf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>An Object Capability primer</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>You can think of a system having <strong>capabilities</strong>: things it can do, like showing information, reading locally stored data, or making requests to other systems like web requests to servers or transaction requests to wallets, and the ability to <strong>delegate</strong> these capabilities to others.</p>\n<p>When delegating a capability, you can provide a limited or restricted version of the capability. This is known as <strong>attenuation</strong>.</p>\n<p>These three components form the basis of the <strong>object capability security model</strong>. By using this model, you can understand who has the ability to do what.</p>\n<h2>Web application security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Browsers do a decent job of sandboxing applications; that is, keeping them separate and preventing them from interfering with your computer or other websites.</p>\n<p>However, they don't provide robust building blocks for web app developers to further sandbox specific portions of their app, which could keep certain components of their app from compromising the whole application.</p>\n<p>For this reason, when importing a library into your application, you are effectively <strong>delegating all capabilities to that library</strong>. This is further complicated by the fact that <strong>most JavaScript libraries bring in not just their own code but a collection of libraries written by various authors.</strong></p>\n<h2>Ledger attack specifics</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>The <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> library is Ledger’s recommended way of integrating with their products. This package is a thin wrapper that loads the latest version of their library from a CDN.</p>\n<p>While this means your app will always have the latest version of the library it also means __you are effectively delegating control of your web app to the Ledger loader library, which in turn delegates it to the code hosted on the CDN. __</p>\n<p>You can model the delegation chain like this:</p>\n<h4><strong>Web App → <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> → jsDelivr CDN → npm → Ledger → Ledger ex-employee → attacker</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Even this is a simplification. Zooming in on one component, <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic\">such as the jsDeliver CDN</a>, can reveal a dazzling complexity of additional services that are also part of the supplychain and potential footholds for launching an attack.</p>\n<h2>Securing applications with Object Capability Security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>While browsers themselves don't provide much tooling, as mentioned, for limiting the capabilities of subcomponents of an application, the JavaScript language is actually well suited for the task.</p>\n<p>JavaScript, with some careful effort, allows you to build Compartments, which limit what code is allowed to access. See Agoric’s <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses\">Hardened Javascript</a> effort for an implementation of Compartments.</p>\n<h4><strong>MetaMask’s <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/\">LavaMoat</a> supply chain security system and the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a> plugin system both build on Compartments to achieve confinement.</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7nIGWogOGAO7RpDLKoqcyS/f83a7d548ee2e47734c74865becb7d25/lavamoat_mystic_1.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0px;\">\n<br />\n<h2>Would LavaMoat have prevented the Ledger supplychain attack?</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Asking if LavaMoat would have prevented it is kinda like asking if the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SYLAi4jwXcs?t=140\">stop-when-touched feature</a> on a table saw would help if you held on to the saw while jumping off a cliff - yes, your fingers would likely remain attached to your hand after the jump.</p>\n<p>In principle, the way <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> works forces the app developer to forgo many of established security best practices. But not all hope is lost.</p>\n<p>The best way to let LavaMoat (and other supply-chain security tools) help you would be to use the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit directly</code>, without handing all control off to the loader.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat was designed to mitigate attacks like the <a href=\"https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-event-stream-incident-45653ecbda99\">Copay wallet hack</a>, also known as “the event-stream incident”, and protects well against it. So, how does LavaMoat fare against this different attack?</p>\n<p>The answer is, unfortunately, the age old “it depends”. LavaMoat is a tool for application developers, not library developers, due to the way it integrates in the app runtime. This means that while some webapps could have protected themselves with LavaMoat, applications without\nLavaMoat would still be vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Additionally, LavaMoat only enforces a policy specified by the developers. <strong>If you specify an unsafe policy, LavaMoat will not be able to protect you.</strong></p>\n<h2>Let's look at how an application with LavaMoat could have been protected from this attack.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>LavaMoat uses a policy file to determine what capabilities, in the form of global platform APIs, a dependency should get. To make this easier, you can have LavaMoat analyze a package and automatically determine what a package seems to need in order to operate. This is known as <strong>static analysis.</strong></p>\n<p>While static analysis is an imperfect means of understanding what some code is trying to do,  <strong>LavaMoat only uses static analysis for convenience</strong> to help you generate a policy file. It does not use static analysis to enforce its policies at runtime. The generated policies are then reviewed, tweaked, and approved by the developer.</p>\n<p>For the original question, one answer is: <strong>Yes, LavaMoat can protect your app and your users from supply chain attacks</strong>, by preventing packages from having the capability to load new code at runtime. It can protect you if you have configured it correctly and if you used dependencies that don’t demand overly powerful capabilities.</p>\n<p>Another answer is: No. <strong>If you had configured LavaMoat to allow <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to operate normally and <a href=\"https://github.com/LedgerHQ/connect-kit/blob/e4e5f5bb3ca13a28921d7357778f132e22ae4c49/packages/connect-kit-loader/src/index.ts#L98-L107\">inject a script tag</a> running any code it likes</strong> outside of the LavaMoat runtime, <strong>the attack still would have succeeded.</strong> This is part of LavaMoat’s compromise between backwards compatibility and a safer system. LavaMoat is very flexible in order to be maximally compatible, so you can drop it in your app without rewriting it from scratch. The responsibility is still on the app developer to set sensible policies and choose sensible dependencies. LavaMoat allows you to selectively provide global browser APIs, but some global APIs simply contain too much power to safely give to a third party package. We’re researching a few different means of further limiting these powers, but making something that just works for packages that make no effort to limit their control is challenging.</p>\n<p>One of LavaMoat’s features, called <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/blob/main/docs/scuttling.md\">Scuttling</a>, would interfere with both the malicious and the original package as loaded by the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code>. Scuttling removes access to capabilities for code running outside the LavaMoat sandbox. This would prevent you from using the unsafe <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to begin with, and push you towards directly using and thus owning the process of updating <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit</code>, ensuring you maintain full control of the code run in your app.</p>\n<h4>While LavaMoat is not a silver bullet, it gives you control and visibility where you would otherwise have none. LavaMoat should be just one tool in your security strategy.</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Here’s what you can do right now to defend against an attack tomorrow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the free <a href=\"https://github.com/apps/socket-security\">Socket.dev dependency monitor</a> (2 min).</li>\n<li>Add a <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html\">CSP</a> with tight control of resources (30 min).</li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat\">LavaMoat</a> to your <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/tree/main/packages/node\">build system</a> and to your <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/tree/main/packages/webpack\">app bundle</a> (1 hr).</li>\n</ul>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Learn about LavaMoat's supply chain security system and how you can use it to defend your app today.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/news/developers/page/7/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/","/news/security/"],"limit":4,"skip":24,"categoryId":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","category":"developers","totalItems":67,"currentPage":7,"totalPages":17,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"is not supported.
