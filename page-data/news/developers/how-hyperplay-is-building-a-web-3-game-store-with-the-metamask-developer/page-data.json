Their mission is to enhance the web3 gaming user experience by integrating interoperability of digital assets, on-chain reputation, and seamless wallet integration into web3 gaming. Currently, HyperPlay has a collection of 67 games in their store, featuring titles from renowned gaming studios such as Square Enix, Animoca, and others. HyperPlay’s store also includes the entire games library from Epic Games and GOG.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">platform</a> is cross-chain and supports games built on Ethereum and every EVM chain, Cosmos, Solana, Starkware, and Sui, with plans to expand support to additional blockchains. Additionally, HyperPlay is cross-platform compatible, offering support for operating systems including Windows, Steam Deck, MacOS, and Linux. Native Windows games can also be launched on MacOS, Linux, or SteamDeck using HyperPlay’s integration of gaming compatibility libraries.</p>\n<p>This case study explores how the MetaMask Developer suite empowers HyperPlay to achieve its mission of bringing immersive gaming experience to web3 players.</p>\n<h2>The challenge: Enable seamless web3 wallet support for game developers and immersive gameplay for users</h2>\n<p>To meet their objective of immersive gameplay and interoperability in web3 gaming, HyperPlay recognizes the necessity for players to use the same wallets across different games and not be forced to create a new wallet for each game that they play. Moreover, to streamline new player onboarding, wallets must be configured so that players aren't forced to exit the game to a separate website to access the web3 aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>A common approach in the current web3 gaming landscape to address this issue involves the use of embedded proprietary wallets. Here, game developers are tasked with creating their own single-game siloed wallets to provide a seamless in-game experience. However, this poses a significant challenge for developers and players, as these wallets increase the friction for playing the game for players who already have a wallet, and they also undermine the interoperability between games because it is difficult to use the assets in these wallets outside of the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2fbSb1kAPlSO8YisT3HxvW/abe9c2b3bc9cc65a1131a21c8c65a172/image__1_.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay image 1\"></p>\n<p>Furthermore, game developers prefer to spend time designing games rather than developing custom wallets and infrastructure with multiple SDK and wallet integrations to ensure cross-chain support for their games.</p>\n<h2>The solution: Improved UX and interoperability with the MetaMask Wallet API and SDK</h2>\n<p>By integrating with the MetaMask Wallet API and SDK, HyperPlay is building a seamless onboarding experience for players. When players encounter their first on-chain transaction without a wallet, they will be able to sign up and onboard a MetaMask wallet in-game. An overlay is displayed on top of the game, and the MetaMask onboarding flow is streamed to the user using graphical libraries like OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan. User interactions are streamed back, leading to calls to the HyperPlay wallet API, which are then directed to the MetaMask Wallet API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3ZIJiLFgbzZDArIxOxTIVi/e3ff6920c115a28667120fb4285ad161/image__1_.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay image 2\"></p>\n<p>Developers don’t need to embed an SDK or include any sort of code or package inside their game either. All they need to do is call the HyperPlay API, which then routes these calls to the MetaMask Wallet API, serving as a communication library for MetaMask.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay was also able to leverage MetaMask Wallet API for authentication and sign-in processes, facilitating transactions in games’ marketplaces for buying and selling gaming items, and offering game developers access to a vast user base with significant liquidity—all without the burden of game developers having to manage the wallet integration on their own.</p>\n<h2>Building new onboarding experiences for web3 users with MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay recently introduced <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> to their game store, with the next step focused on Snaps adoption by game developers. The Snaps integration aims to further enhance the user and developer experience on HyperPlay as the games can prompt users to use specific Snaps beneficial to their gameplay.</p>\n<p>The first use of Snaps on HyperPlay involves non-EVM Snaps that enable players to interact with games on non-EVM blockchains through MetaMask. This feature helps developers of games on non-EVM blockchains to access MetaMask’s vast user base of web3 natives and the liquidity in their wallets. It is also beneficial for players who want to play games available on non-EVM chains but lack knowledge of those blockchains. If the player does not have the required Snap installed, the game can prompt the Snap installation and allow the player to continue the game.</p>\n<p>Another area HyperPlay is investigating is Account Abstraction and Contract Account Allowances. This focus is especially relevant for games generating a high volume of transaction requests daily. Implementing Contract Account Allowances can be beneficial as conducting numerous transactions in-game can negatively impact user experience and security.</p>\n<p>An Account Abstraction Snap can offer a solution by allowing players to deposit a specific amount into a contract account, this account can then use session keys to grant and revoke auto-spendable allowances to particular games, up to a user-defined threshold.</p>\n<h2>Get started with MetaMask Developer today</h2>\n<p>Are you a developer building consumer dapps?</p>\n<p>MetaMask Developer suite, comprising the MetaMask Wallet API, SDK, Web3 service APIs, and Snaps, offers a comprehensive set of tools for onboarding millions of the web’s most engaged users.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">developer portal</a> to learn more about our offerings.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"How MetaMask Developer Suite Powers HyperPlay's Game Store","metaDescription":"Learn how the MetaMask Developer suite was used to build HyperPlay’s web3 game store.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Integrate with your hardware wallet:</strong> Enhance your security by connecting MetaMask to hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor from Portfolio, combining the convenience of MetaMask with the robust security of cold storage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Customize privacy settings:</strong> Adjust your privacy settings to your preference, including setting up a custom RPC for specific networks, managing connected sites, and reviewing permissions. Learn more about how to configure your privacy settings <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>9. Participate in staking:</strong> Stake your crypto directly through MetaMask Portfolio, participating in the decision-making processes of various protocols and earning rewards. In Portfolio, there are three options for staking, Validator, Pooled, and <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake?tab=liquid\">Liquid</a>. The below tutorials show you how easy it is to start staking based on your preference.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQRwcnQVsOE?si=ZT1ykhcORwR4DYXl\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHEymH5s97o?si=ahioErY_gO8k3xDx\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>10. Bridge tokens:</strong> Bridging tokens on MetaMask refers to the process of transferring digital assets or tokens from one blockchain network to another using MetaMask as the interface for the transaction. Bridging tokens is a powerful feature in Portfolio that enhances the interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling users to leverage the unique advantages of each network.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1rwvBWk5XU?si=twN-RTUS1qioHW3l\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<h3><strong>Coming soon in Portfolio</strong></h3>\n<br />\n<p>Transfer assets from centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase and Binance directly to your MetaMask wallet, or between different accounts within MetaMask itself, with enhanced security and ease.
