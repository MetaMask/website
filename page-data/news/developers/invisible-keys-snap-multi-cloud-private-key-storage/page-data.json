As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Invisible Keys Snap</h3>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>Externally-owned accounts are at the core of virtually every dapp or service in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, it is far from trivial to design and implement a wallet application that is both secure and easy to use. Typically, in order to provide full control to the user and high levels of security, we end up resorting to complex and unpractical mechanisms. On the other hand, straightforward and enjoyable user experience is only achieved by asking users to surrend control over their keys.</p>\n<p>With InvisibleKeys, we built on MetaMask’s renowned user experience to propose a new compromise between user experience and security allowing MetaMask to connect to an innovative external multi-cloud wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong>? <strong>InvisibleKeys’ multi-cloud wallet stores the user’s private keys in two or more cloud storage services (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc) in such a way that even if one of these services is compromised the keys never are.</strong> This multi-cloud approach follows a patented workflow (patent US20190095628), which ensures very high levels of security while allowing multi-device synchronisation.</p>\n<p>To import an account from the cloud, MetaMask reads a JSON file in your Google Drive (or any other storage service) with an array of your public keys. Then, to sign a transaction, your private key (PK) is temporarily and locally reconstructed at an external web app that receives MetaMask’s requests for signature, signs the transaction, and returns the signed transaction to MetaMask. The keys are never persisted and only exist temporarily in memory. In addition, to preserve full user control, the PK is never accessed by the MetaMask extension. Even if the wallet is unlocked or compromised, the PK cannot be stolen.</p>\n<p>InvisibleKeys allows users to access their wallet from anywhere in the world, as everything is stored in the cloud, complementing the traditional MetaMask approach and maintaining MetaMask’s high standards for usability and UI interface.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>InvisibleKeys works with two main components: the MetaMask wallet and the external web app.</p>\n<p>As we intend to sign the transaction outside of the wallet, we took advantage of the hardware wallet connection/signing part of the code. Instead of sending the transaction to be signed to a specific hardware, a popup is opened with our web app where the signing will be executed.</p>\n<p>In the web app, the user authenticates with its cloud credentials, the private key is retrieved, the transaction is signed and the key is erased from memory. Finally, the popup is closed and the user is back to the MetaMask wallet which was in a waiting state, expecting a signed transaction to be sent.</p>\n<p>The two components communicate through the browser’s window web API. This is enough in this context since no private information is ever exchanged between the two.</p>\n<h3>UI Changes</h3>\n<p>Firstly, we had to make some UI changes to MetaMask to add our InvisibleKeys connection strategy. It is added the same way a new supported hardware wallet would be added to the app.</p>\n<p>These are some of the changes made to the code. Added a new device and type, and the new button for the UI.</p>\n<p><code>app/scripts/metamask-controller.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>keyringName = InvisibleKeyring.type;\nbreak;\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ui/pages/create-account/connect-hardware/select-hardware.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>  renderConnectToInvisibleButton() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;button\n        className={classnames('hw-connect__btn', {\n          selected: this.state.selectedDevice === 'invisible',\n        })}\n        onClick={(_) => this.setState({ selectedDevice: 'invisible' })}\n      >\n        &#x3C;img\n          className=\"hw-connect__btn__img\"\n          src=\"images/invisible-logo.png\"\n          alt=\"Invisible\"\n        />\n      &#x3C;/button>\n    );\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Invisible Keys Keyring</h3>\n<p>To connect different hardware wallets, the Keyring class acts as an interface to communicate between the wallet and the brand’s device. The main methods needed to import accounts and sign transactions are: <code>addAccounts()</code> which returns an array of addresses, and <code>signTransaction()</code>, which returns a signed transaction.</p>\n<p>We’ve implemented these methods on <code>InvisibleKeyring</code>. The first one opens the popup and expects a message with an array of addresses. The second one opens the popup with the unsigned transaction encoded in a message. Then, expects an encoded signed transaction, which will be returned and the main controller will send. When waiting for the closure of the popup, the Metamask is in a loading state.</p>\n<p>These methods make calls to a different class <code>InvisibleConnect</code> which is responsible for the web app connection and communication.</p>\n<p><code>./InvisibleConnect.js</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default class InvisibleConnect {\n\n  {...}\n\n  const appUrl = 'http://url-to-web-app';\n\n  async getAccountsCloud() {\n    let newAccounts = []\n\n    //create a listener for the imported accounts\n    window.addEventListener(\n      'message',\n      event => {\n        if (event.data.event_id === 'imported_accounts') {\n          newAccounts = event.data.accounts\n        }\n      },\n      false,\n    )\n\n    return new Promise(async resolve => {\n      const child = window.open(appUrl + '/import')\n      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        if (child.closed) {\n          //when the popup is closed\n          clearInterval(interval)\n          this.accounts = newAccounts\n          resolve(newAccounts)\n        }\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  }\n\n  async signTxCloud(transaction) {\n    let signedTx = {}\n\n    //create a listener for the signedTx\n    window.addEventListener(\n      'message',\n      event => {\n        if (event.data.event_id === 'signedTx') {\n          signedTx = {\n            v: event.data.v,\n            r: event.data.r,\n            s: event.data.s,\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      false,\n    )\n\n    return new Promise(async resolve => {\n      const child = window.open(appUrl + '/sign') //open popup\n\n      child.postMessage(\n        //sends message to the popup\n        {\n          event_id: 'unsignedTx',\n          data: {\n            tx: transaction.serialize().toString('hex'),\n          },\n        },\n        '*',\n      )\n\n      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        if (child.closed) {\n          //when the popup is closed\n          clearInterval(interval)\n          resolve(signedTx)\n        }\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  }\n}\n./eth-invisible-keyring.js\n\nimport InvisibleConnect from './InvisibleConnect'\n\nclass InvisibleKeyring extends EventEmitter {\n\n  {...}\n\n  addAccounts(n = 1) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      this.unlock()\n        .then(async _ => {\n          const from = this.unlockedAccount\n          const to = from + n\n          this.accounts = []\n\n          for (let i = from; i &#x3C; to; i++) {\n            const address = InvisibleConnect.getAccounts(i).address\n\n            this.accounts.push(address)\n            this.accountIndexes[ethUtil.toChecksumAddress(address)] = i\n            this.page = 0\n          }\n          resolve(this.accounts) //resolve the new accounts\n        })\n        .catch(e => {\n          reject(e)\n        })\n    })\n  }\n\n  signTransaction(address, tx) {\n    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {\n      try {\n        const signedTx = await InvisibleConnect.signTxCloud(tx)\n        const txData = tx.toJSON()\n        txData.v = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.v)\n        txData.r = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.r)\n        txData.s = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.s)\n\n        const common = tx.common\n        const freeze = Object.isFrozen(tx)\n        const feeMarketTransaction = FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction.fromTxData(\n          txData,\n          {common, freeze},\n        )\n        resolve(feeMarketTransaction)\n      } catch (err) {\n        reject(new Error(err))\n      }\n    })\n  }\n\n   {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>External App</h3>\n<p>The app has two pages: one where the accounts are imported and the other where the transaction is signed.</p>\n<p>In the first one, the user authenticates to google drive where a file with its public keys is stored in <code>metamask/public.json</code>. Then, after clicking the import button, the file is fetched, and the keys are read and sent through the window web API to the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const sendAccountsToMetamask = (publicKeys: Address[]) => {\n\twindow.opener.postMessage(\n\t  {\n\t    event_id: 'importAccounts',\n\t    data: {\n\t      accounts: publicKeys,\n\t    },\n\t  },\n\t  '*'\n\t);\n};\n\nconst getPublicKeys = async (): void => {\n     const publicKeys: Address[] = await getGoogleDrivePublicKeys();\n     sendAccountsToMetamask(publicKeys);\n     return;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the second one, the user has to authenticate to both Google Drive and Dropbox, which were the services we used for this example. The approach is compatible with any storage service. The requirement being that they are non-colluding, independent services. After authentication, the different parts of information are retrieved from those services and the private key is reconstructed using the <code>decrypt()</code> method, which is implemented according to the mechanism described in the aformentioned patent, and the transaction is signed.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Integrate with your hardware wallet:</strong> Enhance your security by connecting MetaMask to hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor from Portfolio, combining the convenience of MetaMask with the robust security of cold storage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Customize privacy settings:</strong> Adjust your privacy settings to your preference, including setting up a custom RPC for specific networks, managing connected sites, and reviewing permissions. Learn more about how to configure your privacy settings <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>9. Participate in staking:</strong> Stake your crypto directly through MetaMask Portfolio, participating in the decision-making processes of various protocols and earning rewards. In Portfolio, there are three options for staking, Validator, Pooled, and <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake?tab=liquid\">Liquid</a>. The below tutorials show you how easy it is to start staking based on your preference.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQRwcnQVsOE?si=ZT1ykhcORwR4DYXl\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHEymH5s97o?si=ahioErY_gO8k3xDx\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>10. Bridge tokens:</strong> Bridging tokens on MetaMask refers to the process of transferring digital assets or tokens from one blockchain network to another using MetaMask as the interface for the transaction. Bridging tokens is a powerful feature in Portfolio that enhances the interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling users to leverage the unique advantages of each network.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1rwvBWk5XU?si=twN-RTUS1qioHW3l\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<h3><strong>Coming soon in Portfolio</strong></h3>\n<br />\n<p>Transfer assets from centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase and Binance directly to your MetaMask wallet, or between different accounts within MetaMask itself, with enhanced security and ease. Stay tuned for this feature coming soon in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> not only simplifies the management of digital assets but also opens up a world of possibilities for users to explore and engage with the decentralized ecosystem, all while maintaining a high level of security and user control.
