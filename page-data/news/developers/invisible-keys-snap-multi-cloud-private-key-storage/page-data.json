As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Invisible Keys Snap</h3>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>Externally-owned accounts are at the core of virtually every dapp or service in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, it is far from trivial to design and implement a wallet application that is both secure and easy to use. Typically, in order to provide full control to the user and high levels of security, we end up resorting to complex and unpractical mechanisms. On the other hand, straightforward and enjoyable user experience is only achieved by asking users to surrend control over their keys.</p>\n<p>With InvisibleKeys, we built on MetaMask’s renowned user experience to propose a new compromise between user experience and security allowing MetaMask to connect to an innovative external multi-cloud wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong>? <strong>InvisibleKeys’ multi-cloud wallet stores the user’s private keys in two or more cloud storage services (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc) in such a way that even if one of these services is compromised the keys never are.</strong> This multi-cloud approach follows a patented workflow (patent US20190095628), which ensures very high levels of security while allowing multi-device synchronisation.</p>\n<p>To import an account from the cloud, MetaMask reads a JSON file in your Google Drive (or any other storage service) with an array of your public keys. Then, to sign a transaction, your private key (PK) is temporarily and locally reconstructed at an external web app that receives MetaMask’s requests for signature, signs the transaction, and returns the signed transaction to MetaMask. The keys are never persisted and only exist temporarily in memory. In addition, to preserve full user control, the PK is never accessed by the MetaMask extension. Even if the wallet is unlocked or compromised, the PK cannot be stolen.</p>\n<p>InvisibleKeys allows users to access their wallet from anywhere in the world, as everything is stored in the cloud, complementing the traditional MetaMask approach and maintaining MetaMask’s high standards for usability and UI interface.</p>\n<h3>Architecture</h3>\n<p>InvisibleKeys works with two main components: the MetaMask wallet and the external web app.</p>\n<p>As we intend to sign the transaction outside of the wallet, we took advantage of the hardware wallet connection/signing part of the code. Instead of sending the transaction to be signed to a specific hardware, a popup is opened with our web app where the signing will be executed.</p>\n<p>In the web app, the user authenticates with its cloud credentials, the private key is retrieved, the transaction is signed and the key is erased from memory. Finally, the popup is closed and the user is back to the MetaMask wallet which was in a waiting state, expecting a signed transaction to be sent.</p>\n<p>The two components communicate through the browser’s window web API. This is enough in this context since no private information is ever exchanged between the two.</p>\n<h3>UI Changes</h3>\n<p>Firstly, we had to make some UI changes to MetaMask to add our InvisibleKeys connection strategy. It is added the same way a new supported hardware wallet would be added to the app.</p>\n<p>These are some of the changes made to the code. Added a new device and type, and the new button for the UI.</p>\n<p><code>app/scripts/metamask-controller.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>keyringName = InvisibleKeyring.type;\nbreak;\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ui/pages/create-account/connect-hardware/select-hardware.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>  renderConnectToInvisibleButton() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;button\n        className={classnames('hw-connect__btn', {\n          selected: this.state.selectedDevice === 'invisible',\n        })}\n        onClick={(_) => this.setState({ selectedDevice: 'invisible' })}\n      >\n        &#x3C;img\n          className=\"hw-connect__btn__img\"\n          src=\"images/invisible-logo.png\"\n          alt=\"Invisible\"\n        />\n      &#x3C;/button>\n    );\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Invisible Keys Keyring</h3>\n<p>To connect different hardware wallets, the Keyring class acts as an interface to communicate between the wallet and the brand’s device. The main methods needed to import accounts and sign transactions are: <code>addAccounts()</code> which returns an array of addresses, and <code>signTransaction()</code>, which returns a signed transaction.</p>\n<p>We’ve implemented these methods on <code>InvisibleKeyring</code>. The first one opens the popup and expects a message with an array of addresses. The second one opens the popup with the unsigned transaction encoded in a message. Then, expects an encoded signed transaction, which will be returned and the main controller will send. When waiting for the closure of the popup, the Metamask is in a loading state.</p>\n<p>These methods make calls to a different class <code>InvisibleConnect</code> which is responsible for the web app connection and communication.</p>\n<p><code>./InvisibleConnect.js</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default class InvisibleConnect {\n\n  {...}\n\n  const appUrl = 'http://url-to-web-app';\n\n  async getAccountsCloud() {\n    let newAccounts = []\n\n    //create a listener for the imported accounts\n    window.addEventListener(\n      'message',\n      event => {\n        if (event.data.event_id === 'imported_accounts') {\n          newAccounts = event.data.accounts\n        }\n      },\n      false,\n    )\n\n    return new Promise(async resolve => {\n      const child = window.open(appUrl + '/import')\n      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        if (child.closed) {\n          //when the popup is closed\n          clearInterval(interval)\n          this.accounts = newAccounts\n          resolve(newAccounts)\n        }\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  }\n\n  async signTxCloud(transaction) {\n    let signedTx = {}\n\n    //create a listener for the signedTx\n    window.addEventListener(\n      'message',\n      event => {\n        if (event.data.event_id === 'signedTx') {\n          signedTx = {\n            v: event.data.v,\n            r: event.data.r,\n            s: event.data.s,\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      false,\n    )\n\n    return new Promise(async resolve => {\n      const child = window.open(appUrl + '/sign') //open popup\n\n      child.postMessage(\n        //sends message to the popup\n        {\n          event_id: 'unsignedTx',\n          data: {\n            tx: transaction.serialize().toString('hex'),\n          },\n        },\n        '*',\n      )\n\n      const interval = setInterval(() => {\n        if (child.closed) {\n          //when the popup is closed\n          clearInterval(interval)\n          resolve(signedTx)\n        }\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  }\n}\n./eth-invisible-keyring.js\n\nimport InvisibleConnect from './InvisibleConnect'\n\nclass InvisibleKeyring extends EventEmitter {\n\n  {...}\n\n  addAccounts(n = 1) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      this.unlock()\n        .then(async _ => {\n          const from = this.unlockedAccount\n          const to = from + n\n          this.accounts = []\n\n          for (let i = from; i &#x3C; to; i++) {\n            const address = InvisibleConnect.getAccounts(i).address\n\n            this.accounts.push(address)\n            this.accountIndexes[ethUtil.toChecksumAddress(address)] = i\n            this.page = 0\n          }\n          resolve(this.accounts) //resolve the new accounts\n        })\n        .catch(e => {\n          reject(e)\n        })\n    })\n  }\n\n  signTransaction(address, tx) {\n    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {\n      try {\n        const signedTx = await InvisibleConnect.signTxCloud(tx)\n        const txData = tx.toJSON()\n        txData.v = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.v)\n        txData.r = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.r)\n        txData.s = ethUtil.addHexPrefix(signedTx.s)\n\n        const common = tx.common\n        const freeze = Object.isFrozen(tx)\n        const feeMarketTransaction = FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction.fromTxData(\n          txData,\n          {common, freeze},\n        )\n        resolve(feeMarketTransaction)\n      } catch (err) {\n        reject(new Error(err))\n      }\n    })\n  }\n\n   {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>External App</h3>\n<p>The app has two pages: one where the accounts are imported and the other where the transaction is signed.</p>\n<p>In the first one, the user authenticates to google drive where a file with its public keys is stored in <code>metamask/public.json</code>. Then, after clicking the import button, the file is fetched, and the keys are read and sent through the window web API to the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const sendAccountsToMetamask = (publicKeys: Address[]) => {\n\twindow.opener.postMessage(\n\t  {\n\t    event_id: 'importAccounts',\n\t    data: {\n\t      accounts: publicKeys,\n\t    },\n\t  },\n\t  '*'\n\t);\n};\n\nconst getPublicKeys = async (): void => {\n     const publicKeys: Address[] = await getGoogleDrivePublicKeys();\n     sendAccountsToMetamask(publicKeys);\n     return;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the second one, the user has to authenticate to both Google Drive and Dropbox, which were the services we used for this example. The approach is compatible with any storage service. The requirement being that they are non-colluding, independent services. After authentication, the different parts of information are retrieved from those services and the private key is reconstructed using the <code>decrypt()</code> method, which is implemented according to the mechanism described in the aformentioned patent, and the transaction is signed.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?
