The toolkit is designed to solve significant UX problems that prevent mainstream web3 adoption &#x26; offers tools to unlock new social coordination use-cases. The Red Balloon was a social strategy game played at the EthCC conference in Brussels from July 7th to 9th, 2024. Participants experienced instant onboarding, cost-effective gas sponsorship, and multi-hop delegations for the first time in a web3 game.</p>\n<p>The goal of the challenge was to find 10 balloons scattered throughout the conference venue and win 5 ETH as the prize. However, due to the geographical and temporal distribution of the balloons, it was impossible for a single player to find all 10 balloons independently. This game was inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Network_Challenge\">DARPA Network challenge</a> and simulates a difficult large-scope problem that requires decentralized collaboration to solve.</p>\n<p>The first person to collect all 10 balloons and claim the win took home the prize money minus any commissions for people whose balloons were used for the win.</p>\n<p>This case study discusses how the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/introducing-the-delegation-toolkit-metamask-smart-contract-account-offering/\">MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</a> made each feature of the Red Balloon game possible.</p>\n<h2>Scan to play: featuring instant web3 onboarding</h2>\n<p>One of the main features of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is the ability for users to bypass the typical web3 wallet connection flow, eliminating the need to install a traditional wallet or worry about seed phrases.</p>\n<p>For Red Balloon, players onboard the game by scanning a QR code from either a physical balloon or another player who has already onboarded the game. This generates a counterfactual (free and instant) embedded smart account for them in the game web app, after which they can get straight to playing without thinking of creating or connecting a wallet, on-ramping, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/30xLTWrV2sNdQPKan4CIhd/d488393d44f93179dff3941af84136ec/image3.gif\" alt=\"Game UI GIF\"></p>\n<h2>Collect and share balloons: featuring off-chain delegations</h2>\n<p>Each balloon in the game was represented by a unique NFT smart contract assigned to a delegator account. This delegator account could issue delegations to players who discovered the corresponding physical balloon, allowing them to assign themselves as holders to claim a win. Here are the two types of delegations we implemented:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delegations from the delegator account</strong>: This allowed a player to receive a special delegation from the delegator account when they found a physical balloon. This delegation then granted the player permission to assign themselves as the balloon holder, which was required to call the win function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delegations from peers</strong>: Players could also create offers to other players, specifying the balloons they had access to and the commission they required for another player to use that balloon to claim a win. These were off-chain offers, allowing them to be free and instant.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the delegator account is entirely embedded within the game experience, playing the game did not require players to review any confirmations, making this an interruption-free experience.</p>\n<h2>Claim to win: featuring gas-sponsored batched transactions</h2>\n<p>To win the game, a player needed to be assigned all 10 balloons either by peers or directly from the delegator account before they could call the win function. The first player to achieve this condition was declared the winner and received the prize money, minus any commissions owed to other players who shared their balloon access with the winner.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit ensured that the off-chain agreements between players were programmatically enforced. When a player accepted an offer and used the shared balloons to win the game, the commissions were automatically distributed to the respective balloon owners in an atomically batched transaction.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this was at no cost to the winner and owners of the balloons, as the game featured gas sponsorship. The only time gas costs incurred were for the batched transaction<a href=\"https://lineascan.build/tx/0x04b4f192c6404ea6660f5ea47e7171472254ca42037ce25236ab9445a098fd6a\"> (transaction hash) </a>of claim win, which included the deployment of the winner’s smart account &#x26; transfers to those who won commissions. For a game that engaged <strong>621 players</strong>, we had to pay only <strong>57 cents in gas sponsorship,</strong> which delivered a gas-free end-to-end experience for all users. This feature provides a growth strategy for developers who want a cost-effective way to sponsor gas fees for their users, ensuring a seamless experience without worrying about transaction costs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//downloads.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/C7ozKpT2JT6qQ9a7YYPVf/47ab6c89c691c6e76c688ad313345a4d/image1.gif\" alt=\"image1\"></p>\n<h2>Building better UX in web3</h2>\n<p>Through the innovative design and practical use of the Delegation Toolkit, the Red Balloon game brings a complex concept to life, allowing players to experience the potential of decentralized coordination and programmatically enforced agreements while offering a seamless onboarding and gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>This demonstration not only highlights the unique capabilities of the Delegation Toolkit but also offers EthCC participants a glimpse into the future of web3 UX.

This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful combination. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks or buy crypto with fiat.
