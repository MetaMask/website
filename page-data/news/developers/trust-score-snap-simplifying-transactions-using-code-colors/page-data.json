Decoding methods and arguments is a good first step, but if users interact with a malicious contract, the visible information can be misleading. To counterbalance this, I thought about showing quantitative data, in a very simple manner, using code colors 🟥 🟧 🟩. The idea is to show a trust score based on data that is easy to verify from multiple sources. I chose to start with 4 criterias:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many users have interacted with the smart-contract overall.</li>\n<li>How often the current account has interacted with this contract.</li>\n<li>How old this contract is.</li>\n<li>Has this contract code been verified.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<h4>The insights main function</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The snap is very simple, and is easy to extend. Here is the full <a href=\"https://github.com/Tbaut/template-snap-monorepo\">code</a> that we will go through.</p>\n<p>When the insights tab is clicked on MetaMask, the <code>onTransaction</code> function is called. Inide it, we call each function diving us the criteria that we decided to take into account.</p>\n<pre><code>type ScoreResult = {\n  score: number;\n  description: string;\n};\n\nconst onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({\n  transaction,\n  chainId,\n}) => {\n  // call all the insights criteria\n  // they all return a ScoreResult\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those functions generally call an api, and process the results. Let’s dig into one of these to understand.</p>\n<h4>Determine a trust score based on overall interactions</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Let’s dig in the function giving a score based on the total amount of transaction that a contract received. We use the Etherscan api here, but any other api could work to verify the same data.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Gets a trust score for a contract based on the overall tx count\n * 3 -> the contract had overall >=100 txs\n * 2 -> the contract had overall 50 &#x3C;= tx &#x3C; 99\n * 1 -> the contract had overall tx &#x3C; 50\n *\n *@param options0\n * @param options0.chainId - the chain id to call the api with\n * @param options0.contractAddress - the contract address to check\n * @returns the score and a description\n */\nexport async function getContractTransactionCountScore({\n  chainId,\n  contractAddress,\n}: IContractTransactionCountScore): Promise&#x3C;ScoreResult> {\n  // get the api url asking for the 100th transaction\n  // it will return undefined if there is none\n  const url100 = getEtherscanContractTxsUrl({\n    txNumber: 100,\n    chainId,\n    contractAddress,\n  });\n  const { result: result100 } = await fetchUrl&#x3C;EtherscanResponse>(url100);\n\n  // if there is a 100th tx it means the contract\n  // has received at least 100 txs. We have all we need\n  // we can return with the best score of 3\n  if (result100.length === 1) {\n    return {\n      score: 3,\n      description: 'more than 100 txs',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // this will be call if there are less than 100 txs\n  // we check if there is a 50th tx.\n  const url50 = getEtherscanContractTxsUrl({\n    txNumber: 50,\n    chainId,\n    contractAddress,\n  });\n  const { result: result50 } = await fetchUrl&#x3C;EtherscanResponse>(url50);\n\n  // if there is a 50th tx we can return with a score of 2\n  if (result50.length === 1) {\n    return {\n      score: 2,\n      description: 'more than 50 txs',\n    };\n  }\n\n  // otherwise, return with the lowest score\n  return {\n    score: 1,\n    description: 'fewer than 50 txs',\n  };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Not all scores are equal</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Now that we have a <code>TrustResult</code> for each of our criteria, it is time to apply weights. Indeed, not all of our criterias trust score should have the same weight. For instance, the amount of past transactions with the contract has a cost. If a scammer was willing to game it, it would cost them some ETH for gas. As a result, this criteria is considered more costly to game, hence more important, I gave it a weight of 3.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the contract’s age cannot be circunvented by an attacker, they would have to deploy it, and then wait before launching their attack if they wanted to have a high trust score. I gave it a weight of 2.</p>\n<p>The other criterias are considered weaker and have a weight of 1.</p>\n<pre><code>// arbitrary weight for each score\nconst Weights = {\n  contractTransactionCountScore: 3,\n  contractAgeScore: 2,\n  contractVerificationScore: 1,\n  contractUserTransactionScore: 1,\n};\n\n// calculate the overall trust score after applying the weights\nconst calculateOverallScoreWithWeight = ({\n  contractTransactionCountScore,\n  contractUserTransactionScore,\n  contractAgeScore,\n  contractVerificationScore,\n}: CalculateOverallScoreWithWeightArgs) => {\n  const totalWeitght = Object.values(Weights).reduce(\n    (acc: number, curr: number) => acc + curr,\n    0,\n  );\n\n  const overallScoreWithWeight =\n    (contractUserTransactionScore.score * Weights.contractUserTransactionScore +\n      contractTransactionCountScore.score *\n        Weights.contractTransactionCountScore +\n      contractAgeScore.score * Weights.contractAgeScore +\n      contractVerificationScore.score * Weights.contractVerificationScore) /\n    totalWeitght;\n\n  return Math.floor(overallScoreWithWeight);\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Present the final score</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Finally, we now have the trust score of a smart contract, we need to show it in a simple manner. The MetaMask insights api only allows to show key value pairs. The keys are in bold, and the values have a reglar font weight. I figured that by using emojis, I could create an interface that is not intimidating to users, while still showing all the information gathered.</p>\n<p>The function transforming the trust score into emojis:</p>\n<pre><code>const getColor = (result: number) => {\n  switch (result) {\n    case 3:\n      return '🟩';\n    case 2:\n      return '🟧';\n    default:\n      return '🟥';\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the return part of the <code>onTransaction</code> function, with some hacks to show key values, in a nice way:</p>\n<pre><code>return {\n    insights: {\n      '': `Trust score: ${getColor(overallScore)}`,\n      ' ': '-----------------------------',\n      'Contract popularity': `${getColor(\n        contractTransactionCountScore.score,\n      )} ${contractTransactionCountScore.description}`,\n      'Previous interactions': `${getColor(\n        contractUserTransactionScore.score,\n      )} ${contractUserTransactionScore.description}`,\n      'Contract age': `${getColor(contractAgeScore.score)} ${\n        contractAgeScore.description\n      }`,\n      'Contract verification': `${getColor(contractVerificationScore.score)} ${\n        contractVerificationScore.description\n      }`,\n    },\n  };\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, I created a very simple interface to call 2 types of contracts, one very well known and used Uniswap contract, and one very recently deployed storage contract, the one presented by default on Remix. I you were to use this snap and interract with the <a href=\"https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45\">Uniswap router contract</a> you would see the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/aTUNnd3NE3KYsfkMIxEsE/6f79c40caed890a21e87de6a529f0e31/Screenshot_2023-05-25_at_6.24.47_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 6.24.47 PM\"></p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>This is only scratching the surface of what information could give user confidence, or prevent them from being phished. The obvious first step would be to use more sources for our data. The contract verification already use Sourcify and Etherscan, but it would be better to use multiple sources for each criteria.</p>\n<p>Then, we should apply more advanced algorithm to prevent scammers from being able to game the scores easiely. For instance, we should count the amount of unique accounts who transacted with a contract. We could do some anaysis on the accounts that interacted with it in the past as well, to make sure they are not all originating from one source. The down-side is that all this analysis is harder to make using multiple sources of truth.</p>\n<p>There are some interesting research as well done on scam detection for smart contract that could be integrated. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07220.pdf\">More info here</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, the overwelming amount of positive reactions I received for this hack shows that users are demending for some more information, and I believe that the fact that it is easy to digest played a key role.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>\n<p>I am a software engineer at ChainSafe and I worked at Parity in the past. I love to build products with a focus on good UX. Web3 is a great playground for me because everything is so complex, trying to make it understandable to as many ppl as possible is a great challenge. I have been in the space for almost 5 years and although I have attended many hackathons, I am generally a volonteer, a mentor or a judge rather than a hacker. The main reason is that I am a perfectionist and generally don’t like quick and dirty solutions :).</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, my colleagues at ChainSafe have built one of the first ever snap, the one for Filecoin. I probably had a look at the code back then, but did not dig further.</p>\n<p>At the time of hacking, the insights api wasn’t actually available to developers. I was talking to the MetaMask team in Lisbon, I did not expect to be able to add a user interface to MetaMask. They told me that it was about to be released, and that I could build on it now. In fact this was only available with a custom build, and the documentation hadn’t been released yet.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>Having the ability to add custom code in a tab, while making sure that this code is safe to execute opens the doors to a huge range of enhancements. I’m very much looking forward to what will come out of this.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you?</strong></p>\n<p>The template monorepo made it a breath to get started. The fact that all my code could be written in one repo, with one command to launch both the test dapp and the snap, both with auto-refresh was a great developer experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What does Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s the extension to an extension.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2><strong>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</strong></h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</strong></p>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2><strong>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</strong></h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
