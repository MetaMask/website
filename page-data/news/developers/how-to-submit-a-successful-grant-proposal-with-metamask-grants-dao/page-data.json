This post outlines what <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> is and how to submit a successful grant application.</p>\n<h3>What is MetaMask Grants DAO and how does it work?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask Grants DAO is an internal Consensys employee-led DAO that aims to foster innovation in the MetaMask ecosystem. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/building-an-extensible-world-with-metamask-grants-dao/\">Established in October 2022</a>, the DAO places an emphasis on builders and their journey to MVP.</p>\n<p>Making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world requires decentralizing efforts to build out a thriving ecosystem to empower our communities. MetaMask Grants DAO not only accelerates growth for crypto-comfortable users but also aims to promote long-term adoption among crypto-curious individuals by providing multiple pathways for participation.</p>\n<p>Every ConsenSys employee can opt-in to be a Grants DAO member with equal voting rights governed by a non-transferable token. Learn more about the DAO <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How do I apply?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>You can apply for a MetaMask grant here: <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\">https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\n</a></p>\n<p>Recipients include projects that have previously collaborated with MetaMask as well as new relationships formed as a result of the DAO.</p>\n<p>We’ll use information from a prior grant recipient, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/metamask-grants-dao-funds-agoric-and-safeheron-with-first-round-of-grants/\">Safeheron</a> as an example in this guide.</p>\n<p>To increase your chances of being funded, make sure to keep these 3 tips in mind when filling out your application:</p>\n<h4>#1 Be specific about your project and the problem you solve</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Make sure you’re able to describe your project clearly. What are your goals, why is it important, and how does it align with our mission? Does it fit into our <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/request-for-proposals\">current wish list</a>?</p>\n<p>In Safeheron’s application, they clearly stated how their project revolved around improving MetaMask’s key management experience, specifically with a focus on helping users manage their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) to reduce phishing attacks while also reducing the chance of those keys being lost.</p>\n<p>This is an extremely important issue to the MetaMask team as we prioritize user security above all else.</p>\n<p>When filling out your grant application, don’t hesitate to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data</strong>: Do you have quantitative data to illustrate the problem you’re solving?</li>\n<li><strong>Track record</strong>: What have you and your team been involved with? Have you participated in one of our hackathons? Collaborated with our team in the past? Let us know! Safeheron mentioned their previous relationship with the MetaMask and Keystone team in implementing a 2/2 MPC snap and described how a grant would fund the evolution of this into a 2/3 MPC snap.</li>\n<li><strong>Roadmap</strong>: What is your vision and what part of your roadmap and execution will our grant enable? Feel free to call out future steps, but be clear in delineating what portion of your project the grant will be funding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#2 Include key milestones and a path to production</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Including milestones, timelines, and a thorough strategy helps us evaluate the feasibility of your project. And maybe we can even fund a portion of your build, so be explicit in your milestones. Be realistic when sketching this out— what targets would you measure your productivity by? What does success look like? Does it make sense to break out your path to production by dev weeks or by milestones achieved?</p>\n<p>Milestones, for example, could look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2/2 MPC solution implemented with MetaMask Flask and Keystone hardware wallet</li>\n<li>Compatible 2/3 MPC algorithm developed</li>\n<li>Designs for the 2/3 MPC experience</li>\n<li>Integration of 2/3 MPC algorithm with Flask, Keystone, and MetaMask Mobile</li>\n<li>Security review</li>\n<li>Marketing and PR preparation</li>\n<li>Launch</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#3 Clearly describe how the budget would be used</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>What would the funding go towards? What are some blocks you’re currently experiencing? Include cost breakdowns so there’s an understanding of where the grant could contribute best.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re requesting funding for $35,000 how much of that will be used for development costs, security audits, marketing, etc.? We commonly see that audit fees can be a point of pressure for teams, so feel free to get an application in, even if it’s just to cover audit costs.</p>\n<h3>Making an impact</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask Grants DAO was funded to enable and empower the developer ecosystem to keep building, innovating, and thriving. If you believe your project is making a positive impact and would benefit from a grant, we encourage you to <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/TQ9ua2g2\">apply for funding!</a></p>\n<p>Keep tabs on our <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> page, and stay up to date on our developer offerings on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMaskDev\">Twitter</a>. We’re looking forward to seeing what you build.</p>\n<p><em>We can’t guarantee when we will review your request or that it will get approved, but know that our team will review the application pipeline as often as we can. Thanks for being patient with us.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you to the Safeheron team for letting us use your application as an example in this guide.</em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive

Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked.

MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1H51TkYG1NHQHa0K9CHsNT/e983121c477c4cde79958c93baaab5be/MetaMask_takedown_time.jpg\" alt=\"MetaMask takedown time\">\n<em>Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of detection on MetaMask.</em></p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities.
