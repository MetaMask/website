While the frontend is a simple web application that hosts the UI, it also acts as a companion DApp for our Snaps application.</p>\n<p>Most of the functionality is achieved in the snap, but the remaining is in the frontend to facilitate the users to request amount from others and/or configure their tags through our UI. While the <em>request amount</em> feature uses the XMTP protocol, the tagging feature uses the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snaps-json-rpc-api\">MetaMask Snaps API</a>.</p>\n<p>We have used the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">snap monorepo</a> as the template to begin with. The full implementation of our project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/shree675/FoxTagger\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>The Snaps Application</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>In our entire implementation, we make use of the following main features provided by the Snaps API:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Persistence storage</li>\n<li>Notifications</li>\n<li>Cron jobs</li>\n<li>Transaction insights</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our implementation begins by first exposing some functions to the frontend in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\index.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'getPersistentStorage':\n      return await getPersistentStorage();\n    case 'setPersistentStorage':\n      await setPersistentStorage(\n        request.params as void | Record&#x3C;string, unknown>,\n      );\n      return null;\n    case 'clearPersistentStorage':\n      await clearPersistentStorage();\n      return null;\n\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Method not found.');\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The functions <code>getPersistenceStorage</code> and <code>setPersistenceStorage</code> are very fundamental as they facilitate the storage and retrieval of tags and other information and are defined as shown in the below code snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  return await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['get'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const clearPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['clear'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const setPersistentStorage = async (\n  data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void,\n) => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['update', data],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>For all the feature implementations, we have created a suitable datastructure for our persistence storage.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"from_account0\": {\n      mainMapping: {\n        \"to_account0\": [\"tag0\",\"tag1\"],\n        ...\n      },\n      usage: {\n        \"tag0\": {\n          limit: \"100000000000\",\n          used: \"800000\",\n          notified: false\n        },\n        ...\n      },\n      latestHash: \"transaction_hash0\"\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>A user can have multiple accounts and each account has its own tags, usage and user-defined limits.</p>\n<h4>Transaction Insights</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The transaction insights feature displays the associated tags, their corresponding expenditures and alerts, if any, in an ongoing transaction.</p>\n<p>In the same <code>index.ts</code> file, we add a transaction insights handler that allows us to intercept an ongoing transaction and interact with the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n  const insights = await getDetails(transaction);\n\n  return {\n    insights,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function <code>getDetails</code> implements the entire logic for calculating the expenditure and showing alerts. This is implemented in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\transaction.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getDetails = async (transaction: Record&#x3C;string, unknown>) => {\n  const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n  const account = (transaction.from as string).toLowerCase();\n  const completeStorage = (await getPersistentStorage()) as any;\n\n  if (!completeStorage?.[account]) {\n    throw new Error('Storage initialization failed.');\n  }\n\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.mainMapping || !storage.usage) {\n    throw new Error('Data corrput. Please re-install the snap.');\n  }\n\n  const tagList = storage.mainMapping[toAddress];\n  if (!tagList?.length) {\n    return {\n      Tag: NO_TAG_MESSAGE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  let tags = '';\n  let alerts = '';\n  let usageMsg = '';\n\n  for (const tag of tagList) {\n    if (tags === '') {\n      tags += `${tag}`;\n    } else {\n      tags += `, ${tag}`;\n    }\n    let { used } = storage.usage[tag];\n    let { limit } = storage.usage[tag];\n    const fixedUsed = FixedNumber.from(used);\n    const fixedLimit = FixedNumber.from(limit);\n    const usedPercent = (\n      Number(fixedUsed.divUnsafe(fixedLimit).toString()) * 100\n    ).toFixed(2);\n    used = BigNumber.from(used);\n    limit = BigNumber.from(limit);\n\n    const amount = BigNumber.from(transaction.value as string);\n    const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gas as string);\n    const total = amount.add(gas);\n\n    if (usageMsg === '') {\n      usageMsg += `${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    } else {\n      usageMsg += ` | ${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    }\n\n    if (!limit.eq('0')) {\n      if (used.gt(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${EXCEEDED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      } else if (used.add(total).gte(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${WILL_EXCEED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (alerts === '') {\n    return {\n      Tag: tags,\n      Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {\n    Tag: tags,\n    Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    Alerts: alerts,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this, we are first checking if the current transaction’s <em>to</em> hash (or <em>to</em> address) is present in the storage. Then we retrieve and calculate the usage percentage. We then check if the usage is about to reach, or has already reached the set limit for that tag and we send an appropriate alert.</p>\n<p>Notice that we use <strong>BigNumber</strong> and <strong>FixedNumber</strong> classes available in the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers\">ethers</a> npm package to handle arithmetic operations on large numbers.</p>\n<p>Transaction insights is now complete and this is the final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/h4Vxe5SiAOs0y7vviJkND/6c637c9e70b041140ca49d14450f478e/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.22.44_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.22.44 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Cron Jobs</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Defined here are three cron jobs, <code>weeklySummary</code> for generating the summary every week, <code>checkLimits</code> to check if the user has exceeded limits on any of his/her tags and <code>updateAmount</code> that updates the usage information of new transactions performed by the user.</p>\n<p>These cron jobs are mentioned in <code>packages\\snap\\snap.manifest.json</code>, with their appropriate frequency. Additionally, a cron job handler is incorporated in <code>index.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>These functionalities are defined in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\cron.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getSummary = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n  let exceeded = false;\n  let hasTag = false;\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      hasTag = true;\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n\n      if (\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt('0')\n      ) {\n        exceeded = true;\n      }\n\n      // reset usage information for the next week\n      newUsage[tag].notified = false;\n      newUsage[tag].used = '0';\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (hasTag) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n  }\n\n  return exceeded;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we iterate through the storage and check if the user has crossed any limits on any of the tags. We then reset <code>notified</code> to <code>false</code> so that it can be reused by <code>checkLimits</code> cron job. We return a boolean value for the cron job handler to pick it up for each user account and send an appropriate notification message at the end of the week.</p>\n<pre><code>export const checkLimits = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const tags: string[] = [];\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n      const { notified } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n      if (\n        !notified &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt(BigNumber.from('0'))\n      ) {\n        tags.push(tag);\n        newUsage[tag].notified = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (tags.length > 0) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n\n    const message = `${LIMIT_ALERT_HEADER + tags.length} tags on ${compact(\n      account,\n    )}`;\n    return message;\n  }\n\n  return null;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above function, we once again iterate through all non-notified user tags and check their usage. If it has exceeded the set limit, we set <code>notified</code> to <code>true</code> so that this tag is not picked up again until the next week. We return a message to the cron job handler stating the number of tags that crossed the limit and the user’s account hash.</p>\n<p>Next, we complete the implementation for <code>updateAmount</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const updateAmount = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://api-goerli.etherscan.io/api?module=account&#x26;action=txlist&#x26;address=${account}&#x26;startblock=0&#x26;endblock=9999999999&#x26;sort=asc&#x26;apikey=${process.env.REACT_API_KEY}`,\n  );\n  const result = await response.json();\n\n  if (!result.result) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  let transactions = result.result;\n  if (transactions.length === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // sort in descending order\n  transactions = transactions.sort(\n    (a: any, b: any) => b.timeStamp - a.timeStamp,\n  );\n\n  const { latestHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  const { prevHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  if (transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  for (const transaction of transactions) {\n    if (transaction.hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n      break;\n    }\n\n    if (transaction.to !== account) {\n      const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n      const tagList = completeStorage[account].mainMapping[toAddress];\n\n      if (tagList !== null &#x26;&#x26; tagList !== undefined) {\n        for (const tag of tagList) {\n          const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gasPrice).mul(\n            BigNumber.from(transaction.gasUsed),\n          );\n          const value = BigNumber.from(transaction.value);\n          const total = gas.add(value);\n          if (prevHash !== latestHash) {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from(\n              completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used,\n            )\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          } else {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from('0')\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  completeStorage[account].prevHash = latestHash;\n  completeStorage[account].latestHash = transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase();\n\n  return completeStorage;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we use the <a href=\"https://docs.etherscan.io/v/goerli-etherscan/\">etherscan API</a> to fetch all the user transactions and update the usage details for each tag. We sort the obtained transactions in decreasing order of time and scan them from <code>latestHash</code> transaction to avoid rescanning of transactions. We finally update <code>latestHash</code>. This cron job runs more frequently than <code>checkLimits</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are a few outputs of the above implementations:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/75yjXTyGHM43SE7mfP81Km/7a2ca077862463f656efadff0ad44a9f/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.26.54_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.26.54 PM\"></p>\n<h4>The Frontend DApp</h4>\n<br /> \n<h5>Tagging Feature</h5>\n<br /> \n<p>The website has two pages. The first page is the landing page where the user can login, add/remove tags, check his/her tag usage distribution, set limits and apply filters on the tags and transactions. All of this is achieved through the familiar React.js functionality. The transactions are fetched from the previously mentioned etherscan API and the addresses are associated with their corresponding tags. This information comes from the persistence storage of the connected Snaps.</p>\n<p>The logic for most of the above features is written in <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\GetTableData.jsx</code>. The integration of the snap with the frontend is sophisticated, yet intuitive once finished.</p>\n<p>The snap methods are exposed to the frontend by writing the following functions in <code>packages\\site\\src\\utils\\snap.ts</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Get the persisted data from the snap.\n *\n * @returns The persisted data, if any, 'null' otherwise.\n */\nexport const getStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'getPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Update the persistent storage in the snap.\n *\n * @param data - The complete data to be stored.\n */\nexport const setStorage = async (data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'setPersistentStorage',\n        params: data,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Clear the persistent storage in the snap.\n */\nexport const clearStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'clearPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2\">react-chartjs-2</a> npm package to display analytics of the user’s expenditure.</p>\n<p>This is the final look of the website:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/AWO9lNPmaXnJXUEtNMXqN/c9b685ec2b2644c1ff6edbe5c3b7f85d/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.28.50_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.28.50 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Request Amount Feature</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This is a unique feature in which a user can send a notification through XMTP to another user requesting for ETH. For this, both the users need to have this snap enabled. This feature is made available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/request\">http://localhost:8000/request</a>.</p>\n<p>For this, we use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xmtp/xmtp-js\">@xmtp/xmtp-js</a> npm package to create <code>WalletContext</code> and <code>XmtpContext</code> in <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\WalletContext.tsx</code> and <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\XmtpContext.tsx</code> respectively. We also create hooks and components. Most of this code directly comes from an example in the <a href=\"https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-quickstart-react\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We create a new page, <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\request.tsx</code> in the website to accommodate the UI for this feature. We send messages using the sendMessage function from the <code>useSendMessage</code> hook.</p>\n<pre><code>import useSendMessage from '../hooks/useSendMessage';\n\nconst sendNewMessage = () => {\n    const payload = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      message: msgTxt,\n    };\n    sendMessage(JSON.stringify(payload));\n    setMsgTxt('');\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we display the received messages using the provider state of <code>XmtpContext</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import { XmtpContext } from '../contexts/XmtpContext';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n    const [providerState] = useContext(XmtpContext);\n    const { convoMessages, client } = providerState;\n\n    return (\n        &#x3C;>\n            &#x3C;ConversationList\n                convoMessages={convoMessages}\n                setSelectedConvo={setSelectedConvo}\n            />\n        &#x3C;/>\n    )\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>After following the example in the above mentioned documentation, we finally attain the required functionality:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/56ckGzBW5BnSehYheh5Eqt/8f3fa3518be25d1fefdd334ef7f1a6f9/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.31.53_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.31.53 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This completes FoxTagger, the entire project with our idea manifested into a MetaMask Snaps application, coupled with a DApp.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The next step would be to extend the tagging functionality by adding more analytics and using a Machine Learning model to make predictions and suggestions on how to minimize the user’s expenditure.\nThen we can aim to incorporate a transaction split feature where the user can split a fee among multiple accounts, adding on top of the request amount feature.</p>\n<p>Additionally, MetaMask Snap’s new custom UI functionality could be leveraged to provide a more pleasing user experience inside the snap.\nFinally, the snap can be extended to chains other than the Goerli Testnet network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6om9b00PGfNjh6CMwVGtui/708e691cdf4d127c9fcad36a5d347676/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.17.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.17.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>From ideation to implementation, our team collaborated to generate ideas, refine them, and overcome challenges to come up with our FoxTagger Snaps.</p>\n<p>Sachin Sahu played a pivotal role in developing the frontend and functionalities of the dApp. Not only did he help integrate MetaMask Snaps with the platform, but he also worked on the demo and documentation to ensure that users have all the information they need to start using the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Siddhartha G's expertise in frontend design and implementation was crucial to the development of the platform. He created intuitive frontend components and methods to present and modify data and assisted in integrating MetaMask Snaps with the dApp.</p>\n<p>Shreetesh M took charge of the backend implementation and ensured that all functions were exposed to the frontend. He implemented transaction insights and cron jobs, which helped the team integrate the backend seamlessly with the frontend.</p>\n<p>Noble Saji Mathews's contributions were instrumental in drafting the framework for transactions through on-chain messaging. He was also part of the ideation process for the tagging and transaction request system, which enhances the platform's usability and user-friendliness.</p>\n<p>Kranthi brought his unique perspective to the table by proposing the idea of the tagging system and exploring novel methods to incorporate decentralized communication. His hard work resulted in the implementation of the 'request' feature, which has revolutionized the way users interact with the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Ansh Anand's expertise in frontend design and ideation process made him an invaluable member of the team. He worked on the demo video, which showcased the platform's capabilities and helped attract more users.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>With more than 21 million active users on MetaMask, it’s kind of hard to achieve functionality that fits everybody’s needs. That's where MetaMask Snaps come in - the developer community now has more freedom to customize and personalize MetaMask based on user requirements, making it easier than ever to interact with different dApps that may be built on different blockchains or use different protocols.</p>\n<p>The benefits of MetaMask Snaps are numerous, including the ability to track expenditures over time, analyze spending, donate a small percent of each transaction to charity, request payment from clients, set up autopay for Netflix subscriptions, and much more! Integrating MetaMask with various DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and social media platforms is now a breeze with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p>But Snaps aren't just for complex financial transactions. Imagine going out to lunch with friends and paying with cryptocurrency - with MetaMask Snaps, splitting the bill and requesting payment from your friends is as simple as a single tap! That’s the power of MetaMask Snaps!</p>\n<p>As the Web3 space continues to evolve, MetaMask Snaps is sure to become an increasingly important tool for developers and users alike. With the potential of the metaverse on the horizon, the use cases of Snaps are truly endless.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>We would advise them to first go through the existing snaps on github. This will help them a lot in understanding the potential of the features provided by MetaMask Snaps, although the features look simple on paper.</p>\n<p>We would also suggest they use the existing monorepo template to start with their implementation. It has many benefits. The repo is structured very well along with linting checks and actions, developers can implement both a companion web app and a snap in one package. Moreover, the repo is always on par with the official documentation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we recommend them to post their issues or doubts on community channels and help increase their exposure to MetaMask’s Snaps.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7.
