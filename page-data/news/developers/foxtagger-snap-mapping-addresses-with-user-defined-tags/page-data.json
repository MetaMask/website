While the frontend is a simple web application that hosts the UI, it also acts as a companion DApp for our Snaps application.</p>\n<p>Most of the functionality is achieved in the snap, but the remaining is in the frontend to facilitate the users to request amount from others and/or configure their tags through our UI. While the <em>request amount</em> feature uses the XMTP protocol, the tagging feature uses the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-rpc-api.html#snaps-json-rpc-api\">MetaMask Snaps API</a>.</p>\n<p>We have used the <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/template-snap-monorepo\">snap monorepo</a> as the template to begin with. The full implementation of our project can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/shree675/FoxTagger\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>The Snaps Application</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>In our entire implementation, we make use of the following main features provided by the Snaps API:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Persistence storage</li>\n<li>Notifications</li>\n<li>Cron jobs</li>\n<li>Transaction insights</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our implementation begins by first exposing some functions to the frontend in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\index.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onRpcRequest: OnRpcRequestHandler = async ({ request }) => {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'getPersistentStorage':\n      return await getPersistentStorage();\n    case 'setPersistentStorage':\n      await setPersistentStorage(\n        request.params as void | Record&#x3C;string, unknown>,\n      );\n      return null;\n    case 'clearPersistentStorage':\n      await clearPersistentStorage();\n      return null;\n\n    default:\n      throw new Error('Method not found.');\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The functions <code>getPersistenceStorage</code> and <code>setPersistenceStorage</code> are very fundamental as they facilitate the storage and retrieval of tags and other information and are defined as shown in the below code snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  return await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['get'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const clearPersistentStorage = async () => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['clear'],\n  });\n};\n\nexport const setPersistentStorage = async (\n  data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void,\n) => {\n  await wallet.request({\n    method: 'snap_manageState',\n    params: ['update', data],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>For all the feature implementations, we have created a suitable datastructure for our persistence storage.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"from_account0\": {\n      mainMapping: {\n        \"to_account0\": [\"tag0\",\"tag1\"],\n        ...\n      },\n      usage: {\n        \"tag0\": {\n          limit: \"100000000000\",\n          used: \"800000\",\n          notified: false\n        },\n        ...\n      },\n      latestHash: \"transaction_hash0\"\n    },\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>A user can have multiple accounts and each account has its own tags, usage and user-defined limits.</p>\n<h4>Transaction Insights</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The transaction insights feature displays the associated tags, their corresponding expenditures and alerts, if any, in an ongoing transaction.</p>\n<p>In the same <code>index.ts</code> file, we add a transaction insights handler that allows us to intercept an ongoing transaction and interact with the MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<pre><code>export const onTransaction: OnTransactionHandler = async ({ transaction }) => {\n  const insights = await getDetails(transaction);\n\n  return {\n    insights,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function <code>getDetails</code> implements the entire logic for calculating the expenditure and showing alerts. This is implemented in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\transaction.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getDetails = async (transaction: Record&#x3C;string, unknown>) => {\n  const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n  const account = (transaction.from as string).toLowerCase();\n  const completeStorage = (await getPersistentStorage()) as any;\n\n  if (!completeStorage?.[account]) {\n    throw new Error('Storage initialization failed.');\n  }\n\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.mainMapping || !storage.usage) {\n    throw new Error('Data corrput. Please re-install the snap.');\n  }\n\n  const tagList = storage.mainMapping[toAddress];\n  if (!tagList?.length) {\n    return {\n      Tag: NO_TAG_MESSAGE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  let tags = '';\n  let alerts = '';\n  let usageMsg = '';\n\n  for (const tag of tagList) {\n    if (tags === '') {\n      tags += `${tag}`;\n    } else {\n      tags += `, ${tag}`;\n    }\n    let { used } = storage.usage[tag];\n    let { limit } = storage.usage[tag];\n    const fixedUsed = FixedNumber.from(used);\n    const fixedLimit = FixedNumber.from(limit);\n    const usedPercent = (\n      Number(fixedUsed.divUnsafe(fixedLimit).toString()) * 100\n    ).toFixed(2);\n    used = BigNumber.from(used);\n    limit = BigNumber.from(limit);\n\n    const amount = BigNumber.from(transaction.value as string);\n    const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gas as string);\n    const total = amount.add(gas);\n\n    if (usageMsg === '') {\n      usageMsg += `${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    } else {\n      usageMsg += ` | ${tag}: ${usedPercent}%`;\n    }\n\n    if (!limit.eq('0')) {\n      if (used.gt(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${EXCEEDED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      } else if (used.add(total).gte(limit)) {\n        alerts += `${WILL_EXCEED_MESSAGE + toEth(limit)} for the tag ${tag}. `;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (alerts === '') {\n    return {\n      Tag: tags,\n      Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    };\n  }\n\n  return {\n    Tag: tags,\n    Usage: usageMsg + FOOTER_NOTE,\n    Alerts: alerts,\n  };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this, we are first checking if the current transaction’s <em>to</em> hash (or <em>to</em> address) is present in the storage. Then we retrieve and calculate the usage percentage. We then check if the usage is about to reach, or has already reached the set limit for that tag and we send an appropriate alert.</p>\n<p>Notice that we use <strong>BigNumber</strong> and <strong>FixedNumber</strong> classes available in the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers\">ethers</a> npm package to handle arithmetic operations on large numbers.</p>\n<p>Transaction insights is now complete and this is the final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/h4Vxe5SiAOs0y7vviJkND/6c637c9e70b041140ca49d14450f478e/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.22.44_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.22.44 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Cron Jobs</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Defined here are three cron jobs, <code>weeklySummary</code> for generating the summary every week, <code>checkLimits</code> to check if the user has exceeded limits on any of his/her tags and <code>updateAmount</code> that updates the usage information of new transactions performed by the user.</p>\n<p>These cron jobs are mentioned in <code>packages\\snap\\snap.manifest.json</code>, with their appropriate frequency. Additionally, a cron job handler is incorporated in <code>index.ts</code> file.</p>\n<p>These functionalities are defined in <code>packages\\snap\\src\\cron.ts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const getSummary = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n  let exceeded = false;\n  let hasTag = false;\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      hasTag = true;\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n\n      if (\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt('0')\n      ) {\n        exceeded = true;\n      }\n\n      // reset usage information for the next week\n      newUsage[tag].notified = false;\n      newUsage[tag].used = '0';\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (hasTag) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n  }\n\n  return exceeded;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we iterate through the storage and check if the user has crossed any limits on any of the tags. We then reset <code>notified</code> to <code>false</code> so that it can be reused by <code>checkLimits</code> cron job. We return a boolean value for the cron job handler to pick it up for each user account and send an appropriate notification message at the end of the week.</p>\n<pre><code>export const checkLimits = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const storage = completeStorage[account];\n  if (!storage.usage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const { usage } = storage;\n  const tags: string[] = [];\n  const newUsage: any = {};\n\n  for (const tag in usage) {\n    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(usage, tag)) {\n      const { used } = usage[tag];\n      const { limit } = usage[tag];\n      const { notified } = usage[tag];\n\n      newUsage[tag] = usage[tag];\n      if (\n        !notified &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(used).gt(BigNumber.from(limit)) &#x26;&#x26;\n        BigNumber.from(limit).gt(BigNumber.from('0'))\n      ) {\n        tags.push(tag);\n        newUsage[tag].notified = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (tags.length > 0) {\n    storage.usage = newUsage;\n    completeStorage[account] = storage;\n    await setPersistentStorage(completeStorage);\n\n    const message = `${LIMIT_ALERT_HEADER + tags.length} tags on ${compact(\n      account,\n    )}`;\n    return message;\n  }\n\n  return null;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above function, we once again iterate through all non-notified user tags and check their usage. If it has exceeded the set limit, we set <code>notified</code> to <code>true</code> so that this tag is not picked up again until the next week. We return a message to the cron job handler stating the number of tags that crossed the limit and the user’s account hash.</p>\n<p>Next, we complete the implementation for <code>updateAmount</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>export const updateAmount = async (account: string, completeStorage: any) => {\n  const response = await fetch(\n    `https://api-goerli.etherscan.io/api?module=account&#x26;action=txlist&#x26;address=${account}&#x26;startblock=0&#x26;endblock=9999999999&#x26;sort=asc&#x26;apikey=${process.env.REACT_API_KEY}`,\n  );\n  const result = await response.json();\n\n  if (!result.result) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  let transactions = result.result;\n  if (transactions.length === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // sort in descending order\n  transactions = transactions.sort(\n    (a: any, b: any) => b.timeStamp - a.timeStamp,\n  );\n\n  const { latestHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  const { prevHash } = completeStorage[account];\n  if (transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  for (const transaction of transactions) {\n    if (transaction.hash.toLowerCase() === latestHash) {\n      break;\n    }\n\n    if (transaction.to !== account) {\n      const toAddress = (transaction.to as string).toLowerCase();\n      const tagList = completeStorage[account].mainMapping[toAddress];\n\n      if (tagList !== null &#x26;&#x26; tagList !== undefined) {\n        for (const tag of tagList) {\n          const gas = BigNumber.from(transaction.gasPrice).mul(\n            BigNumber.from(transaction.gasUsed),\n          );\n          const value = BigNumber.from(transaction.value);\n          const total = gas.add(value);\n          if (prevHash !== latestHash) {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from(\n              completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used,\n            )\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          } else {\n            completeStorage[account].usage[tag].used = BigNumber.from('0')\n              .add(total)\n              .toString();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  completeStorage[account].prevHash = latestHash;\n  completeStorage[account].latestHash = transactions[0].hash.toLowerCase();\n\n  return completeStorage;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we use the <a href=\"https://docs.etherscan.io/v/goerli-etherscan/\">etherscan API</a> to fetch all the user transactions and update the usage details for each tag. We sort the obtained transactions in decreasing order of time and scan them from <code>latestHash</code> transaction to avoid rescanning of transactions. We finally update <code>latestHash</code>. This cron job runs more frequently than <code>checkLimits</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are a few outputs of the above implementations:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/75yjXTyGHM43SE7mfP81Km/7a2ca077862463f656efadff0ad44a9f/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.26.54_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.26.54 PM\"></p>\n<h4>The Frontend DApp</h4>\n<br /> \n<h5>Tagging Feature</h5>\n<br /> \n<p>The website has two pages. The first page is the landing page where the user can login, add/remove tags, check his/her tag usage distribution, set limits and apply filters on the tags and transactions. All of this is achieved through the familiar React.js functionality. The transactions are fetched from the previously mentioned etherscan API and the addresses are associated with their corresponding tags. This information comes from the persistence storage of the connected Snaps.</p>\n<p>The logic for most of the above features is written in <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\GetTableData.jsx</code>. The integration of the snap with the frontend is sophisticated, yet intuitive once finished.</p>\n<p>The snap methods are exposed to the frontend by writing the following functions in <code>packages\\site\\src\\utils\\snap.ts</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Get the persisted data from the snap.\n *\n * @returns The persisted data, if any, 'null' otherwise.\n */\nexport const getStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'getPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Update the persistent storage in the snap.\n *\n * @param data - The complete data to be stored.\n */\nexport const setStorage = async (data: Record&#x3C;string, unknown> | void) => {\n  await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'setPersistentStorage',\n        params: data,\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n\n/**\n * Clear the persistent storage in the snap.\n */\nexport const clearStorage = async () => {\n  return await window.ethereum.request({\n    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',\n    params: [\n      defaultSnapOrigin,\n      {\n        method: 'clearPersistentStorage',\n      },\n    ],\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2\">react-chartjs-2</a> npm package to display analytics of the user’s expenditure.</p>\n<p>This is the final look of the website:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/AWO9lNPmaXnJXUEtNMXqN/c9b685ec2b2644c1ff6edbe5c3b7f85d/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.28.50_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.28.50 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Request Amount Feature</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This is a unique feature in which a user can send a notification through XMTP to another user requesting for ETH. For this, both the users need to have this snap enabled. This feature is made available at <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/request\">http://localhost:8000/request</a>.</p>\n<p>For this, we use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xmtp/xmtp-js\">@xmtp/xmtp-js</a> npm package to create <code>WalletContext</code> and <code>XmtpContext</code> in <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\WalletContext.tsx</code> and <code>packages\\site\\src\\contexts\\XmtpContext.tsx</code> respectively. We also create hooks and components. Most of this code directly comes from an example in the <a href=\"https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-quickstart-react\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>We create a new page, <code>packages\\site\\src\\pages\\request.tsx</code> in the website to accommodate the UI for this feature. We send messages using the sendMessage function from the <code>useSendMessage</code> hook.</p>\n<pre><code>import useSendMessage from '../hooks/useSendMessage';\n\nconst sendNewMessage = () => {\n    const payload = {\n      id: Date.now(),\n      message: msgTxt,\n    };\n    sendMessage(JSON.stringify(payload));\n    setMsgTxt('');\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we display the received messages using the provider state of <code>XmtpContext</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import { XmtpContext } from '../contexts/XmtpContext';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n    const [providerState] = useContext(XmtpContext);\n    const { convoMessages, client } = providerState;\n\n    return (\n        &#x3C;>\n            &#x3C;ConversationList\n                convoMessages={convoMessages}\n                setSelectedConvo={setSelectedConvo}\n            />\n        &#x3C;/>\n    )\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>After following the example in the above mentioned documentation, we finally attain the required functionality:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/56ckGzBW5BnSehYheh5Eqt/8f3fa3518be25d1fefdd334ef7f1a6f9/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.31.53_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.31.53 PM\"></p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>This completes FoxTagger, the entire project with our idea manifested into a MetaMask Snaps application, coupled with a DApp.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>The next step would be to extend the tagging functionality by adding more analytics and using a Machine Learning model to make predictions and suggestions on how to minimize the user’s expenditure.\nThen we can aim to incorporate a transaction split feature where the user can split a fee among multiple accounts, adding on top of the request amount feature.</p>\n<p>Additionally, MetaMask Snap’s new custom UI functionality could be leveraged to provide a more pleasing user experience inside the snap.\nFinally, the snap can be extended to chains other than the Goerli Testnet network.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6om9b00PGfNjh6CMwVGtui/708e691cdf4d127c9fcad36a5d347676/Screenshot_2023-05-10_at_1.17.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-10 at 1.17.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>From ideation to implementation, our team collaborated to generate ideas, refine them, and overcome challenges to come up with our FoxTagger Snaps.</p>\n<p>Sachin Sahu played a pivotal role in developing the frontend and functionalities of the dApp. Not only did he help integrate MetaMask Snaps with the platform, but he also worked on the demo and documentation to ensure that users have all the information they need to start using the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Siddhartha G's expertise in frontend design and implementation was crucial to the development of the platform. He created intuitive frontend components and methods to present and modify data and assisted in integrating MetaMask Snaps with the dApp.</p>\n<p>Shreetesh M took charge of the backend implementation and ensured that all functions were exposed to the frontend. He implemented transaction insights and cron jobs, which helped the team integrate the backend seamlessly with the frontend.</p>\n<p>Noble Saji Mathews's contributions were instrumental in drafting the framework for transactions through on-chain messaging. He was also part of the ideation process for the tagging and transaction request system, which enhances the platform's usability and user-friendliness.</p>\n<p>Kranthi brought his unique perspective to the table by proposing the idea of the tagging system and exploring novel methods to incorporate decentralized communication. His hard work resulted in the implementation of the 'request' feature, which has revolutionized the way users interact with the Snap's dApp.</p>\n<p>Ansh Anand's expertise in frontend design and ideation process made him an invaluable member of the team. He worked on the demo video, which showcased the platform's capabilities and helped attract more users.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>With more than 21 million active users on MetaMask, it’s kind of hard to achieve functionality that fits everybody’s needs. That's where MetaMask Snaps come in - the developer community now has more freedom to customize and personalize MetaMask based on user requirements, making it easier than ever to interact with different dApps that may be built on different blockchains or use different protocols.</p>\n<p>The benefits of MetaMask Snaps are numerous, including the ability to track expenditures over time, analyze spending, donate a small percent of each transaction to charity, request payment from clients, set up autopay for Netflix subscriptions, and much more! Integrating MetaMask with various DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and social media platforms is now a breeze with MetaMask Snaps.</p>\n<p>But Snaps aren't just for complex financial transactions. Imagine going out to lunch with friends and paying with cryptocurrency - with MetaMask Snaps, splitting the bill and requesting payment from your friends is as simple as a single tap! That’s the power of MetaMask Snaps!</p>\n<p>As the Web3 space continues to evolve, MetaMask Snaps is sure to become an increasingly important tool for developers and users alike. With the potential of the metaverse on the horizon, the use cases of Snaps are truly endless.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>We would advise them to first go through the existing snaps on github. This will help them a lot in understanding the potential of the features provided by MetaMask Snaps, although the features look simple on paper.</p>\n<p>We would also suggest they use the existing monorepo template to start with their implementation. It has many benefits. The repo is structured very well along with linting checks and actions, developers can implement both a companion web app and a snap in one package. Moreover, the repo is always on par with the official documentation.</p>\n<p>Finally, we recommend them to post their issues or doubts on community channels and help increase their exposure to MetaMask’s Snaps.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay.

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams.

Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts.

This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities.
