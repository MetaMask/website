For the average person, trying to wrap your head around how blockchain technology works, what is gas, or how to bridge assets can be a daunting task. Unfamiliar technical words, new patterns, and lack of education are some major user experience (UX) issues in web3 slowing down mass adoption.</p>\n<p>When I decided to focus my career on designing web3 products, my main motivation was the huge UX challenge to democratize the use of crypto, especially to make self-custodial wallets secure and easy to use. But like any big task, this challenge requires  collective effort—it needs the ideas and perspectives of more designers, and above all, it needs the web3 space to give UX the importance that it deserves.</p>\n<p>But it's not enough to just talk about it, you have to lead by example, and that's exactly what we did: We teamed up with <a href=\"https://hoprnet.org/\">HOPR</a> to organize the first UX hackathon in the history of web3. Here’s how it went.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4BURqxSIRs506tYIxO4hm/636064d4fe78b84a5500dc1f7d263cbc/hackathon_team_pic.jpeg\" alt=\"hackathon team pic\"></p>\n<h3>The ETH Zurich Hackathon</h3>\n<p>We gathered more than thirty designers onsite and remotely at ETH Zurich to tackle <strong>two of the most important challenges in web3: privacy and security.</strong></p>\n<p>Before making the designers' heads crawl with solving complex problems, we kicked off the hackathon with a workshop on privacy and UX in web3 diving into the evolution of the internet and the fundamental pillars of making the experience of using a crypto wallet accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>The main topics focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contextualization and education:</strong> Knowing how to use these powerful tools helps break down the barrier of crypto jargon that is so intimidating to new users</li>\n<li><strong>Embracing transparent design:</strong> Keeping users well informed and safe is important, even if that means adding a little more friction to their experience</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> We are still in the early stage of web3, so now more than ever, UX design has to use mental models and existing patterns from web2, whenever possible, so we can make the experience of buying crypto from a wallet not too different from ordering a burger from a delivery app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the designers warmed up, it was time to introduce the brief of the two challenges they could choose from.</p>\n<h3>MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>The first one focused on MetaMask Snaps. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> is a new way to create web3 end-user experiences, this new tool is to web3 what the iPhone is to cell phones: a before and after in how we build and interact with wallets.</p>\n<p>This is not just a new feature made by MetaMask, it’s a system that allows anyone to build on top of our wallet to expand its capabilities and customize the wallet experience without asking for permission from anyone except the end user. So, with Snaps, users will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go beyond Ethereum and access other blockchains like Bitcoin.</li>\n<li>Make it possible to integrate any scaling solution and make exploring Layer 2s accessible to everyone.</li>\n<li>Enable authentication, privacy, and consent in ways that keep users in control while empowering them with more ways to protect their data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And privacy was precisely the main protagonist of this UX hackathon and a prevailing pillar in our ecosystem. Web3 technology is still in its early stages and there aren’t widely adopted standards for storing or accessing data yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hoprnet.org/\">HOPR</a> is a Swiss project that aims to improve the privacy and security of web3 transactions by obscuring all metadata, including IP addresses, making it impossible to tell anything about who is sending data or what data they’re sending. And how can they bring this to regular users without making them run their own nodes? By creating a HOPR Snap to bring an extra layer of privacy and security to user’s transactions. This challenge’s brief focused on designing the integration of Snaps into the Metamask Extension’s UI, the installation of the HOPR Snap and a send flow using the Snap.</p>\n<p>The winners of this challenge have weighed in on different solutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NayatCheikh\">Nayat Cheikh</a>: Lead Product Designer at Vesper, designed a scenario in line with how Snaps would work today by downloading the HOPR Snap from their website and a more idealistic user experience scenario—the Snap could be downloaded directly from the MM extension, onboarding users on Snaps as well as thinking about the user flow of how to send a transaction once the Snap is installed in both cases when the user has funds to pay the transaction fee and when they don’t.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52FfXP1P2Q86ZEheHg7ib6/b4680b622ee91f908ae9065024bcf59a/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.30.26_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.30.26 AM\"></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IDfBAffJ8Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/freberghmans?lang=en\">Frederic Berghman</a>: Digital customer experience lead at Bitcoin Suisse, stepped out of his comfort zone as a designer to remind us that UX is not just about designing interfaces but also about thinking about how to bring real value to users. His solution goes beyond the installation of the Snap in the extension, and evolved into a business model of the product that includes insurance for users of the HOPR snap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6AD8mDHuhV33uayVjpgtC9/aa6ac6322cddf05900ae49d03411722b/Frederick.jpg\" alt=\"Frederick\"></p>\n<h3>Social Recovery</h3>\n<p>The second challenge was focused on introducing Social Recovery to MetaMask to help reduce the blockage of funds on the blockchain when users forget their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). This feature would make newcomers feel more secure in a decentralized environment where not everyone wants to have the responsibility of their wallet’s safety. Unlike a traditional self custodial wallet where only you can recover access to your funds via your Secret Recovery Phrase, Social Recovery would allow users to still be the only ones to access to their funds while letting them choose a trusted group of people who can help them recover their wallet if access is lost. This solution to key management would help us onboard more users to DeFi while adding an extra layer of security to their experience, which makes it an exciting UX challenge to explore.</p>\n<p>The winners of this challenge have introduced this feature consciously during the onboarding flow without adding cognitive load or making the experience too long for users, allowing them to rely on the people they already trust to start their crypto journey with confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Sanmartin</strong>: UX researcher and designer at Akasha Foundation,  went further by thinking not only of creating a flow to allow adding guardians during the onboarding to help recover the user's account, but thought of introducing the feature even when the user has already made the onboarding, allowing users to request their contacts to be their guardians or request to be guardian of other accounts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4DSWO82OtJD6ucDX8dxqLt/b7bea43f2ac7462c68711995438b6430/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.39.32_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.39.32 AM\"></p>\n<p><strong>Sinlin Yeo</strong>: Head of Product Design at web3Auth, thought of a flow straight forward and well contextualized both guard creation and recovery request using patterns that users new to web3 may find familiar from web2 products. Her approach is a good reminder that, in the vast majority of cases, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3rD6oYCvnHYaYK8xSJRmxc/03909bfbfabddb5ea026d1afe26c3a28/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.40.28_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.40.28 AM\"></p>\n<h3>The Future of Crypto Is All About UX</h3>\n<p>Web2 products have raised the bar of user experience design, our users are expecting to have intuitive and easy-to-use products, but web3 still has 99 problems and UX is one of them. Our products are still complex and intimidating to use. The good news is that this is starting to shift—we are making great strides in improving the safety and accessibility of our products—but there is still a long way to go.</p>\n<p>In the midst of a turbulent market and the recent insolvency of big CeFi players:, the need to focus on building decentralized finance is an obvious fact that no one will deny. But when we say “buidl” we are not just referring to the amazing developers in our ecosystem, we are also stressing the need of putting user experience and accessible design at the center of our attention to onboard the new wave of users in DeFi.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We made history!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
