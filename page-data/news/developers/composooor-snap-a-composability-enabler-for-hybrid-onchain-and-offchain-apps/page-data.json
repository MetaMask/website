More and more apps are using offchain resources (such as computation or data storage) verified in the contract logic due to blockchains technical limitations. Examples include order books, merkle trees of airdrops, sorted lists, token attributes etc.</p>\n<p>In each case valuable information is stored/computed off chain but can be used and has big effects on onchain interactions. To make this possible, contracts use different cryptographic techniques such as hashes or signatures to check validity. Dapps then require frontends/apis with specific logic that can come up with the relevant information for the contract. Sadly this pattern breaks composability, e.g a DeFi app relying on a proprietary order book served on AWS can’t be easily integrated by another smart contract.</p>\n<p>Fed up by those limitations we decided to come up with a standard and infrastructure to enable all apps to be easily integrated into anything. We strongly believe that making integrations easier again are opening many opportunities to the space.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>\n<p>The Composooor metamask snap is used to standardize and handle communication between a web client, one or multiple offchain arbitrary ressources, and an arbitrary number of smart-contracts implementing the composooor standard. All standard ressources are easily accessible on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@composooor/composooor\">an npm package</a> that makes using composooor’s superpowers a one liner in most cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Step by step</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When preparing a transaction, our metamask snap wallet will request an estimate gas call on the desired on chain contract.</li>\n<li>If the contract needs some data or computation made off chain to function, it will revert with a standardized error containing specs on how to find this missing data. The standardized error looks like this</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>error MissingOffchainDataError(\n    address registryAddress,\n    string url,\n    bytes abiArgs\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>this error is exposed by the <code>ComposooorRegister</code> that contracts must extend to access offchain ressouces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Metamask snap wallet can then decode this error and finds the missing data either by fetching it on a decentralized protocol, or on an API, or by executing some code it fetched from this sources to produce it. For the ETHDenver hackathon, we implemented the simplest option which is the API call.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>const responseData = await fetch(error.url + `?args=${error.abiArgs}`);\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The wallet will then estimate gas again, this time adding an instruction to store the fetched data in the standardized registry of the corresponding contract before calling the desired method.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>const callToRegisterData: Call = {\n    callee: error.registryAddress,\n    functionSelector: utils.id('recordParameter(bytes)').slice(0, 10) as PrefixedBy0x,\n    data: defaultAbiCoder.encode(['bytes'], [data]) as PrefixedBy0x,\n};\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>During the transaction execution, the same or another contract may need another off chain ressource to function. If it’s the case, the wallet loops on the transaction preparation steps until no offchain ressource is needed anymore. This enables endless composability <em>between protocols</em> accessing rich offchain ressources.</li>\n<li>When the gas estimation is successful, the user is prompted with the signature of the prepared transaction, to execute successfully with all necessary ressources included.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What integrating a composooor-enabled app / making your own looks like.</strong></p>\n<p>At ETHDenver we showed how composooor reduces code complexity of the usual hybrid app pattern by at least 80-90%.</p>\n<p><strong>Smart contract side</strong></p>\n<p>Import with import \"<code>@composooor/ComposooorRegister.sol</code>\";.\nExample usage :</p>\n<pre><code>contract Example is ComposooorRegister {\n    function action() public {\n        bytes memory data = consumeParameter(\"http://api.api/number\", abi.encode(arguments));\n        (uint256 offchainNumber) = abi.decode(data, (uint256));\n        (...)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ComposooorRegister</code> is made with solidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Front end side</strong></p>\n<p>The composooor snap yields the most returns on the front-end side: it reduces typically 200+ lines integrations to… 0 ! The snap logic handles everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo</strong></p>\n<p>We made a fully integrated demo in the form of a react-wagmi dapp. This dapp makes it possible to buy an NFT paying only a small fraction of the price upfront and taking a loan to repay later to finance the rest. Onchain, it is no less than 8 contracts which are involved in the transaction. In the middle of it, the NFT marketplace requires an offchain signature of the NFT seller. The composooor snap is able to pick up the error, decode it and provide the information onchain (after being fetched in an api) despite the complexity of the transaction. Composooor made this app way simpler to implement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5hvC8qYY3yAs7nSHVrACLr/77c690ce30608a5b893cf05e954c9dfc/Screenshot_2023-06-26_at_9.49.45_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-26 at 9.49.45 PM\"></p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>Part of such an innovation making developers gain considerable time and enabling new blockchain usecases is adoption. We would implement and deploy multiple user-facing apps using Composooor snap behind the scenes and working with the corresponding snap. If those apps gain traction, we would make some partnerships to compose them with other apps starting a flywheel of adoption fueled by the simplified dev experience. Along the way the snap and the standard would evolve into a more general and standardized product fitting the original vision: connecting blockchains synchronously to arbitrary resources, in an agnostic way regarding decentralization and usecases.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>We’re a team building a lending protocol to use NFTs as collateral with a more capital efficient approach.  We decided to go with an architecture using off-chain components like an order book. This choice allows to improve capital efficiency and user experience but may limit interoperability with other protocols. This is why we developed the Composooor snap allowing easy integration with other protocols. We hope that this library will be used by other teams, opening new possibilities and making their work easier.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space?</strong></p>\n<p>Wallets are one of the main unavoidable pillars/building blocks of web3 and  MetaMask is the defacto default wallet for most users. Enabling developers to leverage this for arbitrary new use cases seems crucial to me. The main point is that we can’t imagine or prepare for all innovations wallets will need to be a part of so giving some access to them is like the transition from bitcoin to ethereum: enable arbitrary use cases on top of your tech has unforeseen exponentially compounding upside. So its hard to answer this question but what I’m most excited about is apps making the wallet do more than just signing messages and optimizes the interactions is a context-rich way for the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>Make use of the template provided and be careful to correctly ask for every user approval needed and use as few as possible.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
