They simplify complex blockchain interactions by turning them into manageable functions, enabling real-time monitoring of blockchain events and facilitating wallet integration for secure user interactions. These libraries also improve web3 developer efficiency by abstracting the complexity of blockchain protocols to offer a consistent API across various networks.</p>\n<p>This blog covers the top three web3 libraries and their key features for developers looking to build on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains.</p>\n<h2>Web3.js</h2>\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://web3js.org\">Web3.js</a> is a collection of JavaScript &#x26; TypeScript libraries that enable developers to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket connections. It serves as a bridge between Ethereum and applications, allowing developers to create dapps that can run on web browsers or servers. Web3.js provides a convenient and accessible interface to Ethereum and its core components, including smart contracts, transactions, and account management.</p>\n<p>Key features of Web3.js include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Interact with smart contracts as JavaScript objects</strong>: Web3.js allows developers to treat Ethereum smart contracts as JavaScript objects, making it straightforward to interact with the blockchain’s data and functions directly from a web application.</li>\n<li><strong>Get block and state information from Ethereum nodes</strong>: The library provides methods to query blocks, transactions, and states directly from Ethereum, which is essential for monitoring network conditions and validating transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Account and transaction management:</strong> Web3.js facilitates the creation of Ethereum accounts and the processing and signing of transactions, which are crucial for enabling users to interact securely and efficiently with the blockchain.</li>\n<li><strong>Subscribe to specific on-chain events</strong>: The library provides functionality to subscribe to events triggered by smart contracts, allowing applications to react in real time to network changes or updates.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Ethers.js</h2>\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.ethers.org/v5/\">Ethers.js</a> is a lightweight library that aims to provide a simpler and more compact way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. It is designed to be easier to use and more modular than Web3.js, making it an attractive option for developers looking for an efficient and streamlined library.</p>\n<p>Key features of Ether.js include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Secure private key management</strong>: Ethers.js prioritizes security by ensuring that private keys are stored on the client side, safeguarding them from unauthorized access and potential security threats.</li>\n<li><strong>Import and export JSON wallets</strong>: The library supports importing and exporting JSON wallets compatible with clients like Geth and Parity, facilitating easy wallet management.</li>\n<li><strong>Versatile network connection options</strong>: The library can connect to Ethereum nodes using various providers, such as INFURA, JSON-RPC, Etherscan, Alchemy, Cloudflare, or even MetaMask, offering developers flexibility in how they interact with Ethereum.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficiency and size</strong>: Ethers.js is incredibly efficient with a tiny footprint (~88kb compressed; 284kb uncompressed), making it ideal for web applications where performance and loading time are critical.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensive documentation</strong>: It boasts detailed and well-maintained documentation, which assists developers in quickly learning and effectively utilizing the library.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Web3.py</h2>\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable\">Web3.py</a> is a Python library designed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It was originally inspired by the Web3.js JavaScript API but has since evolved to cater specifically to the preferences and requirements of Python developers, incorporating Pythonic idioms and functionalities that enhance ease of use and integration with the Python ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Key features of Web3.py include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Middleware configuration</strong>: The library allows for custom middleware configuration, enhancing control over processing requests and responses in interactions with Ethereum nodes.</li>\n<li><strong>Utility functions</strong>: Web3.py includes a suite of utility functions for tasks such as encoding and decoding data, converting currency units, cryptographic hashing, and facilitating common Ethereum-related operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Data fetching and transactions</strong>: The library provides extensive APIs for fetching data from the blockchain (such as balances, transactions, and block data) and creating, signing, and sending transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart contract interaction</strong>: Web3.py supports deploying and interacting with smart contracts, including methods to instantiate contract objects, call their functions, and handle contract events.</li>\n<li><strong>Filtering and event handling</strong>: It offers powerful filtering options for monitoring blockchain events and logs, which is crucial for applications that need real-time updates from the network.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Advance web3 dapp development with MetaMask Developer</h2>\n<p>The libraries discussed are an excellent starting point for launching your dapp development journey quickly. However, they might not cover some advanced features necessary for seamless integration with leading wallets.</p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">MetaMask Developer portal</a> for more advanced development needs, such as Sign-in-with-Ethereum (SIWE), support for EIP-6963, and seamless integration with MetaMask via Snaps. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools, APIs, and SDKs designed to streamline user onboarding and enable developers to forge unique, permissionless wallet connections and in-dapp experiences tailored for MetaMask users.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"Top Three

Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked.

MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1H51TkYG1NHQHa0K9CHsNT/e983121c477c4cde79958c93baaab5be/MetaMask_takedown_time.jpg\" alt=\"MetaMask takedown time\">\n<em>Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of detection on MetaMask.</em></p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities.
