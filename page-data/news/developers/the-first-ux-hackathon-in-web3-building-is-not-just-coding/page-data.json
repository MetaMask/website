For the average person, trying to wrap your head around how blockchain technology works, what is gas, or how to bridge assets can be a daunting task. Unfamiliar technical words, new patterns, and lack of education are some major user experience (UX) issues in web3 slowing down mass adoption.</p>\n<p>When I decided to focus my career on designing web3 products, my main motivation was the huge UX challenge to democratize the use of crypto, especially to make self-custodial wallets secure and easy to use. But like any big task, this challenge requires  collective effort—it needs the ideas and perspectives of more designers, and above all, it needs the web3 space to give UX the importance that it deserves.</p>\n<p>But it's not enough to just talk about it, you have to lead by example, and that's exactly what we did: We teamed up with <a href=\"https://hoprnet.org/\">HOPR</a> to organize the first UX hackathon in the history of web3. Here’s how it went.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4BURqxSIRs506tYIxO4hm/636064d4fe78b84a5500dc1f7d263cbc/hackathon_team_pic.jpeg\" alt=\"hackathon team pic\"></p>\n<h3>The ETH Zurich Hackathon</h3>\n<p>We gathered more than thirty designers onsite and remotely at ETH Zurich to tackle <strong>two of the most important challenges in web3: privacy and security.</strong></p>\n<p>Before making the designers' heads crawl with solving complex problems, we kicked off the hackathon with a workshop on privacy and UX in web3 diving into the evolution of the internet and the fundamental pillars of making the experience of using a crypto wallet accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p>The main topics focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contextualization and education:</strong> Knowing how to use these powerful tools helps break down the barrier of crypto jargon that is so intimidating to new users</li>\n<li><strong>Embracing transparent design:</strong> Keeping users well informed and safe is important, even if that means adding a little more friction to their experience</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> We are still in the early stage of web3, so now more than ever, UX design has to use mental models and existing patterns from web2, whenever possible, so we can make the experience of buying crypto from a wallet not too different from ordering a burger from a delivery app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the designers warmed up, it was time to introduce the brief of the two challenges they could choose from.</p>\n<h3>MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>The first one focused on MetaMask Snaps. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> is a new way to create web3 end-user experiences, this new tool is to web3 what the iPhone is to cell phones: a before and after in how we build and interact with wallets.</p>\n<p>This is not just a new feature made by MetaMask, it’s a system that allows anyone to build on top of our wallet to expand its capabilities and customize the wallet experience without asking for permission from anyone except the end user. So, with Snaps, users will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go beyond Ethereum and access other blockchains like Bitcoin.</li>\n<li>Make it possible to integrate any scaling solution and make exploring Layer 2s accessible to everyone.</li>\n<li>Enable authentication, privacy, and consent in ways that keep users in control while empowering them with more ways to protect their data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And privacy was precisely the main protagonist of this UX hackathon and a prevailing pillar in our ecosystem. Web3 technology is still in its early stages and there aren’t widely adopted standards for storing or accessing data yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hoprnet.org/\">HOPR</a> is a Swiss project that aims to improve the privacy and security of web3 transactions by obscuring all metadata, including IP addresses, making it impossible to tell anything about who is sending data or what data they’re sending. And how can they bring this to regular users without making them run their own nodes? By creating a HOPR Snap to bring an extra layer of privacy and security to user’s transactions. This challenge’s brief focused on designing the integration of Snaps into the Metamask Extension’s UI, the installation of the HOPR Snap and a send flow using the Snap.</p>\n<p>The winners of this challenge have weighed in on different solutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NayatCheikh\">Nayat Cheikh</a>: Lead Product Designer at Vesper, designed a scenario in line with how Snaps would work today by downloading the HOPR Snap from their website and a more idealistic user experience scenario—the Snap could be downloaded directly from the MM extension, onboarding users on Snaps as well as thinking about the user flow of how to send a transaction once the Snap is installed in both cases when the user has funds to pay the transaction fee and when they don’t.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52FfXP1P2Q86ZEheHg7ib6/b4680b622ee91f908ae9065024bcf59a/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.30.26_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.30.26 AM\"></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0IDfBAffJ8Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/freberghmans?lang=en\">Frederic Berghman</a>: Digital customer experience lead at Bitcoin Suisse, stepped out of his comfort zone as a designer to remind us that UX is not just about designing interfaces but also about thinking about how to bring real value to users. His solution goes beyond the installation of the Snap in the extension, and evolved into a business model of the product that includes insurance for users of the HOPR snap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6AD8mDHuhV33uayVjpgtC9/aa6ac6322cddf05900ae49d03411722b/Frederick.jpg\" alt=\"Frederick\"></p>\n<h3>Social Recovery</h3>\n<p>The second challenge was focused on introducing Social Recovery to MetaMask to help reduce the blockage of funds on the blockchain when users forget their Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP). This feature would make newcomers feel more secure in a decentralized environment where not everyone wants to have the responsibility of their wallet’s safety. Unlike a traditional self custodial wallet where only you can recover access to your funds via your Secret Recovery Phrase, Social Recovery would allow users to still be the only ones to access to their funds while letting them choose a trusted group of people who can help them recover their wallet if access is lost. This solution to key management would help us onboard more users to DeFi while adding an extra layer of security to their experience, which makes it an exciting UX challenge to explore.</p>\n<p>The winners of this challenge have introduced this feature consciously during the onboarding flow without adding cognitive load or making the experience too long for users, allowing them to rely on the people they already trust to start their crypto journey with confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Maria Sanmartin</strong>: UX researcher and designer at Akasha Foundation,  went further by thinking not only of creating a flow to allow adding guardians during the onboarding to help recover the user's account, but thought of introducing the feature even when the user has already made the onboarding, allowing users to request their contacts to be their guardians or request to be guardian of other accounts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4DSWO82OtJD6ucDX8dxqLt/b7bea43f2ac7462c68711995438b6430/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.39.32_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.39.32 AM\"></p>\n<p><strong>Sinlin Yeo</strong>: Head of Product Design at web3Auth, thought of a flow straight forward and well contextualized both guard creation and recovery request using patterns that users new to web3 may find familiar from web2 products. Her approach is a good reminder that, in the vast majority of cases, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3rD6oYCvnHYaYK8xSJRmxc/03909bfbfabddb5ea026d1afe26c3a28/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_11.40.28_AM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 11.40.28 AM\"></p>\n<h3>The Future of Crypto Is All About UX</h3>\n<p>Web2 products have raised the bar of user experience design, our users are expecting to have intuitive and easy-to-use products, but web3 still has 99 problems and UX is one of them. Our products are still complex and intimidating to use.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
