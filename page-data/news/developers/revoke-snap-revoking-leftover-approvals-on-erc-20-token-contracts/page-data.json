As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel MetaMask Snaps being built today.</p>\n<h3>Revoke Snap with Swix Jedi and Adrian</h3>\n<p>We chat with Web3 developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swixJedi\">Swix Jedi</a> and Adrian who built the Revoke Snap at the ETHWarsaw Hackathon.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3_Okkp8NHw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong>Snap Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/SwixJedi/revokesnap\">https://github.com/SwixJedi/revokesnap</a></p>\n<p><strong>Why did you build it?</strong></p>\n<p>In order to ensure security of token usage by external actors, ERC20 token standards implement an allowance, where the owner of the token needs to approve an actor (i.e. DEX smart contract) to be able to utilize its tokens up to a chosen limit.</p>\n<p>In order to enhance the somewhat clunky DeFi user experience, many of the DeFi protocols use a max unit 256 value for approvals in order for the user not to have to approve tokens and spend their money on unnecessary gas fees each time they want to interact with their contracts.</p>\n<p>Especially for active DeFi users that can easily create a situation when after using said protocols there are some leftover approvals, which is a potential security threat.</p>\n<p>While there are existing solutions to help users tackle the leftover allowance, only some of them offer approvals directly from the user interface. The process is time consuming as each approval needs to be addressed individually and manually confirmed. While this approach is secure it requires a lot of continuous, manual user interaction.</p>\n<p>This is what pointed us towards an unaddressed niche where we could leverage the MetaMask Snaps capabilities, to make things better.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</strong></p>\n<p>We decided to leverage the following benefits of MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to all accounts in Metamask</li>\n<li>Ability to perform complex operations using a single approval from a user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To propose a solution for this problem, which in the future should make it possible to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Present only one user prompt to get access to all current and future accounts (with notable exception of hardware wallets)</li>\n<li>Revoke all approvals from all current accounts in batch, with no need for separate confirmations and accounts switching</li>\n<li>Actively monitor all user accounts (including those on hardware wallets) for new approvals and display notification to the user when detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On installing the Revoke Snap through the web UI, MetaMask will prompt for needed permissions.</p>\n<p>All permissions are specified in a <code>snap.manifest.json</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\"initialPermissions\": {\n    \"snap_confirm\": {},\n    \"snap_getBip44Entropy_60\": {},\n    \"snap_notify\": {},\n    \"endowment:long-running\": {}\n  },\n</code></pre>\n<p>Two permissions worth noting here are:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Control your “Ethereum” accounts and assets.</strong>\nThis means that to function, our snap requires users parent key (secret key) from MetaMask in order to be able to generate accounts and sign transactions on behalf of the user.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Run indefinitely</strong>\nWhile Revoke Snap is not an implementation that is meant to run in the background continuously, settling transactions on blockchain takes time and MetaMask Snaps do have a built in kill-switch after 60s, which can not be enough to finalize the transactions. This permission allows RevokeSnap to go around that security measure.</p>\n<p>After receiving the necessary permissions RevokeSnap will generate a number of accounts out of the user's private key:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n// Get chosen amount of wallets (signers) from provider (in this case Metamask)\nexport async function getSigners(provider: ethers.providers.Provider, amount: number): Promise&#x3C;Wallet[]> {\n    let wallets: Wallet[] = [];\n\n    for (let i=0; i&#x3C;amount; i++) {\n        wallets.push(await getSigner(provider, i));\n    }\n\n    return wallets;\n}\n\n// Exctract addresses out of wallets\nexport function getAddresses(wallets: Wallet[]): string[] {\n    let addresses: string[] = [];\n\n    for (let i=0; i&#x3C;wallets.length; i++) {\n        addresses.push(wallets[i].address);\n    }\n\n    return addresses;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\n// Fetch parent key from Metamask and generate a wallet from it, base on the input index\nexport async function getSigner(provider: ethers.providers.Provider, index: number): Promise&#x3C;Wallet> {\n    // Metamask uses default HD derivation path\n    // https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/importing-a-seed-phrase-from-another-wallet-software-derivation-path/\n    const ethereumNode = (await wallet.request({\n      method: 'snap_getBip44Entropy_60',\n    })) as unknown as BIP44CoinTypeNode;\n    const deriveEthereumAccount = await getBIP44AddressKeyDeriver(ethereumNode);\n    // A bug:\n    // The current public version of @metamask/key-tree's derive function returns the private key and chain code in a single buffer\n    // Ether.js also accepts a 64 byte buffer without errors and returns wrong keys\n    // Related issue: https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/issues/2926\n    // TODO(ritave): Update to newest key-tree when available and use deriveEthereumAccount(0).privateKey\n    const mainAccountKey = (await deriveEthereumAccount(index)).privateKey;\n    return new Wallet(mainAccountKey, provider);\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then perform a check for leftover approvals and, once the search is complete, expose a button to revoke all identified approvals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4eMGL5OTIo5lvvahzoJzBO/2edd3473ae0f0d836b33cd7f4ff97288/Screen_Shot_2022-11-07_at_3.54.17_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-07 at 3.54.17 PM\"></p>\n<p>On the click of the “Revoke All” button the Snap will issue a series of transactions corresponding to the leftover approval to zero them out one by one. As the Snap already is in possession of the generated wallets private keys this does not require any additional confirmation from the user, beyond the initial one.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the next steps if you would implement this?</strong></p>\n<p>As during the hackathon there was only a limited amount of time to create the most optimum solutions, we utilized a number of functional implementations which have room for improvement.</p>\n<p>For starters, currently the number of accounts generated in the snap is passed as a function parameter and hard-coded as 3. A better option could be for the snap to use an external API (or a dedicated backend) to verify the next transaction nonce on each account for a given chosen chain(s) and only take into account addresses with the nonce number greater than 0.</p>\n<p>Moreover for approvals we used a short list of known addresses of tokens and actors to showcase the functionality, but optimally the approval check should be done more globally. This could be done, i.e. by using an RPC provider API (such as <a href=\"https://infura.io/\">Infura</a>) to find all approval transactions and parse them to display on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m Jedi, I work as a Lead Developer at Swix. I have been in crypto since 2017, and since 2019 I fell down the rabbit hole and started working with DeFi protocols, mostly on the Smart Contract side. With Swix I’m currently working on bridging the real estate yields on-chain and bringing new users into the crypto space.</p>\n<p>I’m Adrian, I’ve worked as a software developer and architect for small startups and big companies. Blockchain has been my main area of interest for many years, particularly the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n<p>During the development of the Revoke Snap we split the work so that Jedi focused on working out how MetaMask Snaps work and setting up necessary basics for the Smart Contact interactions required within our Snap, while Adrian handled the web UI and bundling of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</strong></p>\n<p>We were first introduced to MetaMask Snaps during ETHWarsaw’s presentation, which was quite technical and encompassed more in-depth under the hood workings of the protocol. This triggered us to research the topic some more, and well, here we are.</p>\n<p><strong>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other wallets?</strong></p>\n<p>I mean… the idea itself. MetaMask Snaps breaks out of the standard accepted within the non-custodial browser wallet extensions landscape which is that every transaction, while interacting with web3 applications, needs to be individually approved by the user. Also the functionality of wallets is limited to the functionality the team behind it decides to implement.</p>\n<p>What MetaMask Snaps brings to the table is a platform enabling the bottom-up creation of native wallet integrations for arbitrary blockchain interactions, which carries a lot of resemblance to the mobile app stores.</p>\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3 space? What does MetaMask Snaps mean to you?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest value adds for the crypto space coming from MetaMask Snaps is smoothing of the UX in the crypto and DeFi protocols. Whether that would be enabling bundling transactions, 1-click approval for all transactions made within one dApp, allowing for direct contract interactions while executing credit card-to-crypto purchases or some other even more creative solution, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>It is our strong belief that, especially for the new crypto users, abstracting away the complexity and clunkiness of blockchain interactions can be a game changer.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about what building MetaMask Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your team?</strong></p>\n<p>A big motivator while building Revoke Snap was that MetaMask Snaps are still in development and thus the experimentation we do right now can have a tangible impact on where MetaMask, MetaMask Snaps and, through it to an extent, the crypto space will go. It was a good experience to be able to add our brick to the future of web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask Snaps?</strong></p>\n<p>For any devs looking to try MetaMask Snaps out — have a go at it. MetaMask Snaps are pretty straight forward to start with using the available github template repository and the MetaMask team is very helpful as well. The concept itself has a big potential and there isn’t so much that has been done with it already, so it’s easy to provide a value add.</p>\n<h3>Building with MetaMask Snaps</h3>\n<p>To get started with MetaMask Snaps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checkout the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=post&#x26;utm_campaign=2022_Sep_hackathon-winners-feature-blog-post_content_technical\">developer docs</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a></li>\n<li>Check out a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions/675\">MetaMask Snaps guide</a></li>\n<li>Stay connected with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metamaskdev\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps-skunkworks/discussions\">GitHub discussions</a>, and <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/consensys\">Discord</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep an eye out for our team at the next hackathon in an area near you!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
