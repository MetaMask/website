Security researcher ZachXBT shared a leaked message from an Inferno Drainer Customer group chat. It notified customers that the attacker had updated all customer addresses to the attacker's address. This means customers who performed a successful phishing attack on March 18 had the stolen funds redirected to the attacker's address instead of their customer's address.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Although this was related to an off-chain compromise, the original $2.5M came from victims of phishing attacks. Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">FTX and BlockFi users targeted in Email Phishing Campaign</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6BYDqB0JH0XweutJH4gsUy/3d91e6a33851bb1699815776f5d9f5d9/Screenshot_2024-04-01_at_12.45.45_PM.png\" alt=\"blockfi scam\"></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>FTX and BlockFi users lost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">more than US$ 7 million</a> on the Ethereum mainnet the week of March 18 as they were targeted in a phishing campaign. The specific threat actor, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6C0e83422cD73fFD3A5EC4506638F6A0A8e22b38\">0x6C0e83422cD73fFD3A5EC4506638F6A0A8e22b38</a>, used popular daas (drainer as a service) Pink Drainer to conduct the on-chain portion of the scheme. Many users signed a malicious signature or interacted with a malicious contract, resulting in their wallets being drained of crypto assets. It’s reported that the email list used in this campaign likely came from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mailerlite-confirms-hack-crypto-phishing-email-3m-attacks\">the Mailerlite compromise</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when receiving emails asking them to connect their wallets and sign transactions. To prevent being scammed by impersonators, it is recommended that users check official communications from the organization. A simple search on BlockFi’s and FTX’s websites would have revealed that no official announcement allowed users to withdraw funds. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio’s MakerDao-Based Contract Exploited for $16M</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On the weekend of March 23rd <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio Ecosystem broke the news</a> that their MakerDao-based smart contracts on Ethereum were exploited. This resulted in a total loss of over $16M in crypto assets. All contracts on Polkadot and the Curio Chain itself remained secure. Curio recently posted its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1772354849029464278\">recovery strategy</a> roadmap, highlighting that 100% of funds will be restored to users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone who was a holder of Curio’s governance token was impacted. Unfortunately, this is a scenario where a user would not have been able to protect themselves from this attack, as it involved a vulnerability within Curios’ smart contracts. For those of you who are protocol developers, you can help prevent these attacks by ensuring your smart contracts are thoroughly audited. It's a best practice to have your smart contracts audited continuously with new releases. After completing an audit, projects should participate in a bug bounty program to incentivize researchers to find vulnerabilities in their contracts before threat actors do.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: March 2024","metaDescription":"Lots of exciting activity from ETHDenver and some new snaps additions are covered in this month’s installment.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive our Newsletter","description":null,"portalId":"4795067","formId":"fbfea1e4-e214-4ab2-a98b-964f9a81695a","campaignId":null,"displayTitle":true,"width":null,"customClass":"newsletterOnNewsDetail","customId":null},"latest":{"internal":{"type":"ContentfulLayoutModuleContainer"},"contentful_id":"nO1tqQRjoUDUJfdg2B651","node_locale":"en-US","eyebrow":null,"headline":"Keep reading our latest stories","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Developers, security news, and more</p>"}},"modules":[{"node_locale":"en-US","contentful_id":"6iOGB8Fiab9ilS0jfZ8N5I","fontSize":null,"ctaLink":"/news/","displayText":"All posts","displayTextTreatment":null,"newTab":false,"buttonDisplay":false,"buttonGradient":false,"buttonSecondary":false,"hideButtonIcon":null,"eventLabel":null,"eventCategory":null,"socialLink":null,"showCaretRight":null,"buttonCaretDown":null,"launchDarklyFlag":null,"customClassName":null,"internal":{"type":"ContentfulCta"},"hubSpotForm":null,"embedHTML":null,"downloadBrowsers":null,"mobileCta":null,"alternativeCta":null},{"contentful_id":"1B0wZMveBTSiMJZWu4uunI","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulModuleContainer"},"title":"News > Latest Stories (3 items)","description":null,"numberOfItem":3,"columns":3,"columnType":null,"columnsOnTablet":null,"centerOnTablet":null,"columnsOnMobile":1,"centerOnMobile":null,"contentAlignment":"left","splitModules":false,"displayTitle":false,"isLiquiditySection":false,"isTrustBar":null,"gridModulesGap":"12px","loadMoreMode":null,"loadMoreCta":null,"carouselMode":null,"hasRegionSelector":null,"regionSelectorHeadline":null,"regionSelectorPopupTitle":null,"regionSelectorPopupText":null,"regionListKey":null,"extraData":null,"modules":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}]}],"cta":null,"backgroundColor":"default","displayHeadline":true,"headlineAlignCenter":true,"contentAlignCenter":false,"headlineMarginTop0":null,"paddingTop":"40px","sectionPadding":null,"noPaddingTop":null,"noPaddingBottom":false,"modulesMargin":null,"isTab":false,"moduleId":null,"customClass":"storiesOnNewsDetail","sideImage":null,"backgroundSize":"cover","backgroundImage":null},"latestStories":{"nodes":[{"contentful_id":"1ZwT5dKh4Z0FZuaBp7YSPK","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Transfers from Coinbase and Binance now available in MetaMask","slug":"metamask-centralized-exchange-transfers-coinbase-binance","subtitle":"MetaMask launches new CEX transfer feature to make your wallet more powerful.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
