When these events occur, security researchers spring into action to join war rooms that try to mitigate the damage. But even with the Seal 911 group of auditors and white-hat hackers that was created last August, are we anywhere close to ready for the carnage that might come with the next bull run? Monahan talks about the dangers of bad actors ranging from \"script-kiddies'' to APTs, and the lack of accountability when protocols get hacked.

Oktapus in particular is so-named for their methods of stealing Okta credentials through phishing pages.

The email service provider MailerLite, allegedly hacked, is currently investigating the issue. The phishing emails contained malicious links leading to a multi-chain address. WalletConnect and other Web3 users have been targeted with emails promoting a launchpad launch and a fake Token Terminal beta launch, both containing links to fictitious airdrops. Cybersecurity platform Hudson Rock suggests that a malware program found on a MailerLite employee's computer might have been used to gain access to MailerLite’s servers for data theft and further attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To enhance protection against phishing attacks, users should approach unsolicited emails with caution, regularly update and run antivirus software, and <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/19878220833947-How-to-turn-on-Blockaid-security-alerts\">enable Blockaid security alerts</a> in their MetaMask settings.

This is a common campaign that scammers with a good understanding of Ethereum smart contracts use to spoof Etherscan logs. The scam involves sending airdrops that appear to come from reputable sources to token holders, who are then directed to a fraudulent website where they are tricked into authorizing the attacker to drain their wallets. The scam is sophisticated, utilizing complex smart contract interactions and a proxy contract to obfuscate the true nature of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should approach unsolicited airdrops with caution, scrutinize embedded links in digital assets, and understand the implications of interacting with smart contracts. Users should stay informed about scam tactics, use trusted tools for verifying transactions, and double-check sources of airdrops or transactions. Safe browsing practices and securing assets, such as using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, are recommended. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, education, caution, and skepticism remain key defenses against potential threats.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://securelist.com/new-macos-backdoor-crypto-stealer/111778/\">Cracked Software Loaded with Backdoors to Steal Cryptocurrency</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Kaspersky discovered a sophisticated macOS malware campaign that targets users through cracked apps found on pirating websites. The malware, embedded in repackaged pre-cracked applications, initiates an infection through a Trojan proxy and a post-install script. The malware is capable of running on macOS Ventura 13.6 and later, suggesting a focus on users of newer operating systems. The malware uses a program named \"Activator\" to execute its payload, which includes stealing cryptocurrency wallets. The malware campaign is still a work-in-progress, with the operators frequently updating the malicious scripts. The final payload is a backdoor that can run any scripts with administrator privileges and replace Exodus and Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet applications with infected versions that steal secret recovery phrases.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To safeguard against malware attacks, users should strictly download and install applications from official platforms or trusted third-party app stores, avoiding unverified or pirating websites. It's crucial to keep your operating system and all applications updated, as updates often include security patches that guard against known vulnerabilities.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
