So this month, MetaMask unveiled Smart Transactions that can deliver a 99.5% transaction success rate, MEV protection, pre-simulation, and improved gas settings. As our Executive Product Director Gal Eldar put it:</p>\n<p><em>“At MetaMask, we believe that wallets are uniquely positioned—and in many ways responsible—for addressing these user pain points head-on. The creation of Smart Transactions serves as our commitment to take an even more active role in tackling some of these challenges and to continue innovating at new layers of the wallet experience as part of our efforts to make the process of submitting transactions not just easier and safer but also more efficient and predictable for everyone. Democratizing access to decentralized technologies is a long and winding journey, and Smart Transactions are an important and bold step toward this end.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys/\"><strong>User Guide: Secret Recovery Phrase, Password, and Private Keys</strong></a></p>\n<p>In our continuous quest to educate our users, this recent support article co-authored by Oliver Renwick and Joel Willmore is aimed at teaching newcomers tips to avoid getting themselves rekt.

Check out the X Space he co-hosted with HAPI to discuss how Snaps enables innovation that makes users more secure.</p>\n<p>“One of the most important things is that security is multifaceted and what that means is that there's lots of different stages within your journey as a user in web3 ... where security products are needed. Usually, when people talk about security, they'll talk about one specific area, like 'get a hardware wallet.' A hardware wallet is great but it doesn't protect you if you sign something on a dapp that gives [a bad actor] access to your assets. You can still get drained from a hardware wallet if you interact with a malicious dapp ... At MetaMask we're focused on bringing on security providers and shipping solutions in lots of different areas.”</p>\n<p>The Snaps Directory is growing all the time! <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/\">Click here</a> to see a full list of Security Snaps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/newsletter/archive/podcast-taylor-monahan\"><strong>Taylor Monahan Explains $10M Hack and How to Stay Safe in Crypto in Interview with The Defiant</strong></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7BfHEyiQr8XefMMFkgcAbE/5ad12174182193d4a9db41492050b289/Screenshot_2024-06-06_at_2.38.01_PM.png\" alt=\"taylor monahan\"></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">original interview with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefiantNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DefiantNews</a> is here<br><br>(my opinion on root cause has evolved over time and with add&#39;l investigation but the facts have not changed)<a href=\"https://t.co/cPpcZcEitV\">https://t.co/cPpcZcEitV</a></p>&mdash; Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1788038815682334882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Meanwhile…</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1791291986324103295\">Pink Drainer Shuts Down</a></p>\n<p>Pink Drainer, a notorious crypto wallet drainer, amassed over $85 million by exploiting around 20K victims through sophisticated phishing schemes. Pink Drainer recently announced they are shutting down citing: “We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it's time for us to retire.” Despite Pink Drainer's end, the threat of similar operations looms. Pink Drainer wrote, “It is very likely that our retirement will have no major impact on the scene, people will move on to other drainers just as quickly as they moved to us.”</p>\n<p>Although Pink Drainer is retiring, there are still other popular active wallet drainers. Keeping substantial funds in hardware wallets is highly recommended, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🚨💰 According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@zachxbt</a>, Pink Drainer is shutting down after siphoning off over $75M from around 20k victims in just a year. <a href=\"https://t.co/eg1AUjHJwl\">pic.twitter.com/eg1AUjHJwl</a></p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1791291986324103295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<h4><a href=\"https://mp-weixin-qq-com.translate.goog/s/84lUaNSGo4lhQlpnCVUHfQ?_x_tr_sl=auto&#x26;_x_tr_tl=en&#x26;_x_tr_hl=en&#x26;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">Lazarus(APT-Q-1) Secret Stealing Operation</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Lazarus, an APT group, has been active since 2007, gaining notoriety for its 2014 Sony Pictures attack. Initially focusing on government agencies to steal intelligence, it shifted in 2014 towards targeting global financial institutions and virtual currency trading venues, engaging in the theft of money and assets. The group has employed phishing attacks through fake social accounts that offer bogus job opportunities to individuals in specific industries. Recently, security researchers uncovered a series of attacks involving ZIP files with malicious JS code targeting blockchain developers through job postings on platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and Braintrust. These attacks, consistent with Lazarus's \"Contagious Interview\" campaign, involve tricking candidates into running malicious code that steals crypto-related information and implants malware.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against phishing and malware attacks like those executed by groups such as Lazarus, it's crucial to verify the legitimacy of unexpected job offers through independent research and to maintain robust digital hygiene. This includes using up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security, and exercising caution with email attachments and links from unknown sources. Additionally, keeping all software updated is essential to guard against exploitable vulnerabilities. By adopting these practices, individuals can significantly bolster their defenses against sophisticated cyber threats and safeguard their sensitive information</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/etherscan/status/1788550675993174409\">Address Poisoning Attacks on the Rise, leading a recent victim to a $68M Loss</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Address poisoning is a deceptive tactic where attackers manipulate victims' transaction histories to trick them into sending funds to the wrong address. This method involves creating fake tokens, using 'vanity' addresses that closely resemble the target's, and exploiting the ERC-20 token standard's \"transferFrom()\" function. Attackers employ these strategies to conduct zero-value token transfers and spoofed token transfers, making their fraudulent addresses appear legitimate. These attacks are designed to confuse users into copying the wrong address for their transactions, leading to financial losses. The sophistication of these methods highlights the evolving nature of cyber threats in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against address poisoning, users should avoid copying addresses directly from their transaction history and instead, copy them from a trusted source. Implementing domain names for addresses can enhance distinguishability, though users must be cautious of domain name spoofing.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy, MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security MetaMask offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering Gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. MetaMask offers Yooldo gamers the tools they need to protect against digital threats of every kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to Yooldo to begin your web3 journey, and join the largest gaming platform on Linea.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets.

Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.
