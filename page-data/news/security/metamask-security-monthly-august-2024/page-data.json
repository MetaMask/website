Developed as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), it disguises itself as legitimate software through an Apple disk image, prompting users for their password and MetaMask password upon execution. The malware then steals a variety of sensitive information, including cryptocurrency wallets and browser cookies, storing them in a directory for exfiltration. Cthulhu Stealer, similar in functionality to the Atomic Stealer malware, is part of a growing trend of macOS-targeted malware, underscoring the need for vigilance among Apple users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against threats like the Cthulhu Stealer, macOS users should only download software from trusted sources such as the Apple App Store or official developer websites. Enabling built-in security features like Gatekeeper, which blocks unverified apps, and keeping the system and applications updated with the latest security patches are critical steps. Additionally, using reputable antivirus software can provide an extra layer of protection. By staying informed about potential threats and adopting these proactive security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk of malware infections and safeguard their sensitive information.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://blog.phylum.io/smuggling-malware-in-test-code/\">Fake Developer Jobs Laced with Malware</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The sophisticated malware campaign that has been targeting developers with fake job advertisements for months shows no sign of letting up The malware, disguised as a legitimate npm package named \"execution-time-async,\" installs malicious scripts that steal cryptocurrency and credentials from the victims. The attackers cleverly hid the malware within a test file, exploiting social engineering techniques to lure developers into downloading and executing the compromised package. The malware may be part of a larger social engineering campaign, with ties to North Korean state-sponsored activities.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against such software supply chain attacks, developers should exercise caution when downloading packages, especially from unofficial sources. Always verify the authenticity of job offers and be wary of requests to download software as part of the application process. By staying informed about the latest threats and adopting a cautious approach to software installation, developers can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated malware campaigns.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580\">ZackXBT Uncovers DPRK Developers Working for 25+ Crypto Projects</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>A team recently discovered 1.3 million missing from their treasury, leading them to seek ZachXBT's expertise. The investigation revealed that the team unknowingly employed DPRK IT workers posing under fake identities as developers. This breach led to the laundering of the stolen funds through a complex path of exchanges, bridges, and mixers. ZachXBT then uncovered 25+ additional crypto projects that had hired DPRK developers.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>This incident underscores the critical importance of thorough vetting and monitoring of team members, especially in roles with access to sensitive operations. Teams should implement rigorous background checks, utilize secure code practices, and maintain strict oversight of treasury transactions.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
