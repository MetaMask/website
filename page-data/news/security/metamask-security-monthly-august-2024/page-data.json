Developed as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), it disguises itself as legitimate software through an Apple disk image, prompting users for their password and MetaMask password upon execution. The malware then steals a variety of sensitive information, including cryptocurrency wallets and browser cookies, storing them in a directory for exfiltration. Cthulhu Stealer, similar in functionality to the Atomic Stealer malware, is part of a growing trend of macOS-targeted malware, underscoring the need for vigilance among Apple users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against threats like the Cthulhu Stealer, macOS users should only download software from trusted sources such as the Apple App Store or official developer websites. Enabling built-in security features like Gatekeeper, which blocks unverified apps, and keeping the system and applications updated with the latest security patches are critical steps. Additionally, using reputable antivirus software can provide an extra layer of protection. By staying informed about potential threats and adopting these proactive security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk of malware infections and safeguard their sensitive information.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://blog.phylum.io/smuggling-malware-in-test-code/\">Fake Developer Jobs Laced with Malware</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The sophisticated malware campaign that has been targeting developers with fake job advertisements for months shows no sign of letting up The malware, disguised as a legitimate npm package named \"execution-time-async,\" installs malicious scripts that steal cryptocurrency and credentials from the victims. The attackers cleverly hid the malware within a test file, exploiting social engineering techniques to lure developers into downloading and executing the compromised package. The malware may be part of a larger social engineering campaign, with ties to North Korean state-sponsored activities.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against such software supply chain attacks, developers should exercise caution when downloading packages, especially from unofficial sources. Always verify the authenticity of job offers and be wary of requests to download software as part of the application process. By staying informed about the latest threats and adopting a cautious approach to software installation, developers can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated malware campaigns.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580\">ZackXBT Uncovers DPRK Developers Working for 25+ Crypto Projects</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>A team recently discovered 1.3 million missing from their treasury, leading them to seek ZachXBT's expertise. The investigation revealed that the team unknowingly employed DPRK IT workers posing under fake identities as developers. This breach led to the laundering of the stolen funds through a complex path of exchanges, bridges, and mixers. ZachXBT then uncovered 25+ additional crypto projects that had hired DPRK developers.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>This incident underscores the critical importance of thorough vetting and monitoring of team members, especially in roles with access to sensitive operations. Teams should implement rigorous background checks, utilize secure code practices, and maintain strict oversight of treasury transactions. Additionally, fostering a culture of security awareness and encouraging the reporting of suspicious activities can further safeguard teams.</p>\n<p><img

Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams.

Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities.
