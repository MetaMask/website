All three unlock new possibilities for defending technologies by introducing new capabilities that were never possible before, while taking into consideration the very sensitive ecosystem we know as the browser.</p>\n<p><b>Securely 🔒</b></p>\n<p>With Securely you can preserve exclusive access to native functionalities within the web app and safely access native APIs while resting assured any tampering made to those APIs cannot affect your technology.</p>\n<p>In other words, if in your program you need to use <code>fetch</code> but are worried that it might have been tampered by a third-party JS code running in the same context as your code, with Securely you can access the original <code>fetch</code> API and avoid any potential tampering.</p>\n<p>With Securely you can defend your code against attacks such as prototype pollution and MITB.</p>\n<p>check out Securely’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lavamoat.github.io/securely/demo/\">demo</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lavamoat.github.io/securely/\">source code</a></p>\n<p><b>Snow ❄️</b></p>\n<p>With Snow, you can obtain exclusive first access to all newborn windows within the web app.</p>\n<p>By providing Snow with a single callback, Snow will make sure to call it with every new window that is attached to DOM before granting access to its creator.</p>\n<p>Creating iframes in order to access their new realms to get a hold on freshly new APIs is a common practice by attackers. However, by using Snow you can apply the security policy that you applied in the top window to every new window that is created, and thereby disarm attackers from abusing such techniques.</p>\n<p>Beyond its security aspect, Snow helps you to shape every new realm that comes to life within your web app the way you want it to look. And you can rest assured it’ll do so for every new window no matter how it’s created, thanks to Snow’s focus on covering all possible ways of doing so.</p>\n<p>Snow is built on top of Securely in order to prevent attacks against it.</p>\n<p>check out Snow’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lavamoat.github.io/snow/demo/\">demo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lavamoat.github.io/snow/\">source code</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/lavamoat/snow/wiki/Introducing-Snow\">further documentation</a></p>\n<p><b>Across 🔁</b></p>\n<p>With Across, you can for the first time establish a fully secured communication channel between two scripts that are attached to the same DOM based on their source URL.</p>\n<p>As of today, there is no way for two scripts within a browser web app to exchange information that will be accessible and visible only to them and not to any other script.</p>\n<p>By using Securely and Snow security capabilities, Across unlocks the ability for scripts to share sensitive information with one another in the client side without the need for a server-side entity, and without worrying a third party within the webpage might endanger their communication channel!</p>\n<p>check out Across’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lavamoat.github.io/across/demo/\">demo</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lavamoat.github.io/across/\">source code</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/lavamoat/across/wiki/Introducing-Across\">further documentation</a></p>\n<p>We believe the three can be used to create safer browser-based technologies that are less vulnerable to today’s javascript security threats, and to also unlock new powers for creating strong and secured technologies on top of them.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to learn more and hopefully help improve these tools and rely on them, as at the moment they are still considered to be experimental.</p>\n<h3 class=\"mt-8\">Incident Response</h3>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who has been participating in our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-launches-hackerone-bounty-program-to-sustain-security/\">Bug Bounty Program at HackerOne!</a> If you’re interested in contributing, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/metamask\"><a href=\"https://hackerone.com/metamask\">https://hackerone.com/metamask</a></a>.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, the assets in scope are the MetaMask Extension (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension\">source code</a>), which can be downloaded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://metamask.io/\"><b>at our website</b></a>, and the MetaMask Mobile Application (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/metamask/metamask-mobile\">source code</a>), which can be downloaded from the <b>App Store (iOS)</b> or <b>Google Play (Android)</b>.</p>\n<p>The following table maps the rewards according to severity:</p>\n<div class=\"mt-7\">\n<figure class=\"txt-center\"><img async src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3fiSERzBz9WdyvnsUUkSS8/61bc20ddded3aebf238f54092d7032b4/incident-seveirity.webp\" width=\"720\" height=\"157\" alt=\"severity\" /></figure></div>\n<p>This month, we’ve thanked 10 wonderful hackers whose reports have led to helping us make MetaMask more secure for everyone!

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
