This would introduce a basic functionality that we'd use to ship Snow.js on the user end instead of LavaMoat. The shift aims to embed it directly into the browser, making bypass virtually impossible. This move is crucial for the ongoing development of Snow and plays a key role in addressing and safeguarding against the <a href=\"https://weizmangal.com/content/pdf/The%20same%20origin%20concern.pdf\">Same Origin Concern</a>.</p>\n<p>We've upgraded our policy generation to support ECMAScript Modules (ESM), meaning we now accommodate <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> syntax, moving beyond the traditional <code>require</code> module system in LavaMoat. This enhancement allows us to generate policies for files using ESM syntax, both for the webpack plugin and for our new tool that's being developed on top of Endo.</p>\n<p>Support for target: 'node' is coming to the LavaMoat Webpack Plugin in the next release. We've made it handle the concept of built-in modules.</p>\n<p>Lockdown has now been permanently released on MetaMask mobile for iOS.</p>\n<p>We're also in the process of enhancing our docs to streamline the LavaMoat onboarding experience for the wider ecosystem. We're putting together educational videos to demystify LavaMoat's mechanics and showcase optimal usage practices for applications. With the introduction of the new ESM-compatible LavaMoat runner, our immediate focus is to bridge any functionality gaps left by the transition from lavaMoat-node.</p>\n<h4>🎙️ MetaMask in the Security Ecosystem 🔎</h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/weizmangal/status/1780936809201152042?s=46&#x26;t=3av-wxCFEbML6grYvIm18A\">Overview of LavaDome by Gal Weizman</a></strong></p>\n<p>In the current web development landscape, trust in the code within web applications is compromised, rendering traditional security measures like the Same Origin Policy inadequate. This issue now encompasses protecting web apps from internal threats as well, altering web system architectures.

The attackers utilized CryptoChameleon, a phishing-as-a-service kit focused on cryptocurrency accounts, capable of bypassing multi-factor authentication. The campaign involved tricking users into believing their LastPass account was accessed from a new device, leading them to a phishing site designed to capture their credentials. LastPass has taken action against this threat, which is part of a series of attacks targeting the password manager, including a significant breach disclosed last year.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Always verify the authenticity of any communication claiming to be from a service provider. If you receive a suspicious call, email, or SMS, do not respond directly. Instead, contact the service provider through their official website or customer service number to confirm the communication's legitimacy. You should also be wary of any unsolicited request to provide personal information, click on links, or download attachments, especially if they create a sense of urgency.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/286515/google-sues-two-developers-for-putting-87-fraudulent-crypto-apps-on-google-play-store\">Google Sues Two Developers for Putting 87 Fraudulent Crypto Apps on Google Play Store</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Google has initiated legal action against developers Yunfeng Sun and Hongnam Cheung for distributing 87 fraudulent cryptocurrency apps on the Google Play Store, impacting over 100,000 users, 8,700 of whom are in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, outlines how these apps lured users with the promise of cryptocurrency investments, only to trap them with fees for withdrawing supposed returns. The developers cleverly disguised these apps to mimic legitimate trading platforms, deceiving users into believing they were making genuine investments. Despite Google's efforts to remove these apps, the developers continually evaded detection by altering their identities and network infrastructure, perpetuating their fraudulent scheme on the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>The fraudulent activities of the two scammers, exploiting users' inexperience and employing \"pig butchering\" tactics to entice investments in their apps, underscore the critical importance of due diligence before engaging with any application. To safeguard against such scams, it's essential to thoroughly research and verify an app's legitimacy, including scrutinizing reviews and feedback from other users on social media. Remember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it likely is. These deceptive apps falsely promised returns on investments, highlighting the need for vigilance when investing in crypto.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-deploy-crypto-drainers-on-thousands-of-wordpress-sites/\">Hackers deploy crypto drainers on thousands of WordPress sites</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Nearly 2,000 WordPress sites have been hacked to show fake NFT and discount pop-ups, leading visitors to connect their wallets to crypto drainers that steal funds. Initially, these sites pushed crypto drainers via ads and YouTube, then shifted to brute-forcing admin passwords. Now, they display fraudulent NFT offers, tricking users into connecting wallets to malicious scripts from dynamic-linx[.]com, resulting in theft. Users should only link wallets to trusted platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Keeping substantial funds in hardware wallets is highly recommended, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
