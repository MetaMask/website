Developed as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), it disguises itself as legitimate software through an Apple disk image, prompting users for their password and MetaMask password upon execution. The malware then steals a variety of sensitive information, including cryptocurrency wallets and browser cookies, storing them in a directory for exfiltration. Cthulhu Stealer, similar in functionality to the Atomic Stealer malware, is part of a growing trend of macOS-targeted malware, underscoring the need for vigilance among Apple users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against threats like the Cthulhu Stealer, macOS users should only download software from trusted sources such as the Apple App Store or official developer websites. Enabling built-in security features like Gatekeeper, which blocks unverified apps, and keeping the system and applications updated with the latest security patches are critical steps. Additionally, using reputable antivirus software can provide an extra layer of protection. By staying informed about potential threats and adopting these proactive security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk of malware infections and safeguard their sensitive information.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://blog.phylum.io/smuggling-malware-in-test-code/\">Fake Developer Jobs Laced with Malware</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The sophisticated malware campaign that has been targeting developers with fake job advertisements for months shows no sign of letting up The malware, disguised as a legitimate npm package named \"execution-time-async,\" installs malicious scripts that steal cryptocurrency and credentials from the victims. The attackers cleverly hid the malware within a test file, exploiting social engineering techniques to lure developers into downloading and executing the compromised package. The malware may be part of a larger social engineering campaign, with ties to North Korean state-sponsored activities.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against such software supply chain attacks, developers should exercise caution when downloading packages, especially from unofficial sources. Always verify the authenticity of job offers and be wary of requests to download software as part of the application process. By staying informed about the latest threats and adopting a cautious approach to software installation, developers can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated malware campaigns.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580\">ZackXBT Uncovers DPRK Developers Working for 25+ Crypto Projects</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>A team recently discovered 1.3 million missing from their treasury, leading them to seek ZachXBT's expertise. The investigation revealed that the team unknowingly employed DPRK IT workers posing under fake identities as developers. This breach led to the laundering of the stolen funds through a complex path of exchanges, bridges, and mixers. ZachXBT then uncovered 25+ additional crypto projects that had hired DPRK developers.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>This incident underscores the critical importance of thorough vetting and monitoring of team members, especially in roles with access to sensitive operations. Teams should implement rigorous background checks, utilize secure code practices, and maintain strict oversight of treasury transactions. Additionally, fostering a culture of security awareness and encouraging the reporting of suspicious activities can further safeguard teams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5VaIlpLKMmuyUgnNNOZfoJ/b50356b8615cbb32cabe01c3f468b541/image3.png\" alt=\"Aug security report image 4\"></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: August 2024","metaDescription":"We're excited to share the integration of Wallet Guard into MetaMask","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5nkvJOKbhOfREAkrUfT1kG","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: July 2024","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-july-2024","subtitle":"The MetaMask Security Team has been spreading the word about LavaMoat and LavaDome, has a proposal in incubation, warns about risks to those working in crypto, and our bug bounty program is thriving!","image":{"title":"July 2024 security report","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=webp 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4dqB09tLhBp41r27NGnZHz/d122bc8a4a194e70f404efd3e16c6f8c/MM_Monthly_1024_x_576.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"August 1, 2024","authors":[{"name":"Luker","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3Gr8jOWRn1eQWbkwTYx7mD/87d4242ce876d369766c27516f95bff6/Screenshot_2024-07-29_at_8.47.28_PM.png\" alt=\"César Milstein\"></p>\n<p><em>Argentine biochemist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Milstein\">César Milstein</a> won a Nobel Prize in 1984 for his antibody research.</em></p>\n<h3>🎙️ MetaMask in the Security Ecosystem 🔎</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>MetaMask’s HackerOne Bug Bounty Program Takes the Cake!</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask's bug bounty program (BBP) got a shout-out from both HackerOne founders for setting a great example to others.

This month, the agency followed up with a more in-depth look into how these scams work and what to look out for. They often involve convincing victims to set up cryptocurrency accounts or transfer funds, ultimately stealing their money. The FBI advises job seekers to be cautious of unsolicited job offers, verify the legitimacy of employers, and avoid sharing personal or financial information with unverified sources. Victims of such scams are encouraged to report the incidents to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should express increased scrutiny of financial opportunities, such as jobs requiring them to provide initial funds, jobs that cannot be verified independently, or jobs that appear randomly.

(1) Limit the assets of the wallet you browse daily with. If you sign a malicious signature, the impact will be minimized. (2) Validate the domain the signature request originates from and verify it matches the domain of the original project. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the project's official social media or blog page and check that the domains from these profiles match the request. (3) Validate the token and address contents of the request. The request will often involve a token you did not intend to send. The <code>spender</code> address and or the <code>to</code> address of the transactions will be different than the address you intended. These simple checks can save you from unintended fund loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/299099/attacker-sends-nearly-24000-phishing-emails-derived-from-compromised-coingecko-third-party-email-platform\"><strong>23K Phishing Emails Sent After CoinGeko's 3rd-Party Email Service is Compromised</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, experienced a data breach on June 5 due to a compromised account at their third-party email marketing platform, GetResponse.

SlowMist uncovered that Aggr harvested the cookies of traders utilizing the extension, specifically targeting cookies associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. With these cookies, the malicious actors behind Aggr were able to gain entry to Centralized Exchange (CEX) portals and take control of the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It's crucial for users to be vigilant when downloading any software onto their computers, including applications from browser stores. Researching the developers of extensions is an important step in ensuring safety. A simple review of their personal profile or recent track record should give you a good gauge of whether you can trust them.

So this month, MetaMask unveiled Smart Transactions that can deliver a 99.5% transaction success rate, MEV protection, pre-simulation, and improved gas settings. As our Executive Product Director Gal Eldar put it:</p>\n<p><em>“At MetaMask, we believe that wallets are uniquely positioned—and in many ways responsible—for addressing these user pain points head-on. The creation of Smart Transactions serves as our commitment to take an even more active role in tackling some of these challenges and to continue innovating at new layers of the wallet experience as part of our efforts to make the process of submitting transactions not just easier and safer but also more efficient and predictable for everyone. Democratizing access to decentralized technologies is a long and winding journey, and Smart Transactions are an important and bold step toward this end.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys/\"><strong>User Guide: Secret Recovery Phrase, Password, and Private Keys</strong></a></p>\n<p>In our continuous quest to educate our users, this recent support article co-authored by Oliver Renwick and Joel Willmore is aimed at teaching newcomers tips to avoid getting themselves rekt.

Check out the X Space he co-hosted with HAPI to discuss how Snaps enables innovation that makes users more secure.</p>\n<p>“One of the most important things is that security is multifaceted and what that means is that there's lots of different stages within your journey as a user in web3 ... where security products are needed. Usually, when people talk about security, they'll talk about one specific area, like 'get a hardware wallet.' A hardware wallet is great but it doesn't protect you if you sign something on a dapp that gives [a bad actor] access to your assets. You can still get drained from a hardware wallet if you interact with a malicious dapp ... At MetaMask we're focused on bringing on security providers and shipping solutions in lots of different areas.”</p>\n<p>The Snaps Directory is growing all the time! <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/\">Click here</a> to see a full list of Security Snaps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/newsletter/archive/podcast-taylor-monahan\"><strong>Taylor Monahan Explains $10M Hack and How to Stay Safe in Crypto in Interview with The Defiant</strong></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7BfHEyiQr8XefMMFkgcAbE/5ad12174182193d4a9db41492050b289/Screenshot_2024-06-06_at_2.38.01_PM.png\" alt=\"taylor monahan\"></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">original interview with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefiantNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DefiantNews</a> is here<br><br>(my opinion on root cause has evolved over time and with add&#39;l investigation but the facts have not changed)<a href=\"https://t.co/cPpcZcEitV\">https://t.co/cPpcZcEitV</a></p>&mdash; Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1788038815682334882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Meanwhile…</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1791291986324103295\">Pink Drainer Shuts Down</a></p>\n<p>Pink Drainer, a notorious crypto wallet drainer, amassed over $85 million by exploiting around 20K victims through sophisticated phishing schemes. Pink Drainer recently announced they are shutting down citing: “We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it's time for us to retire.” Despite Pink Drainer's end, the threat of similar operations looms. Pink Drainer wrote, “It is very likely that our retirement will have no major impact on the scene, people will move on to other drainers just as quickly as they moved to us.”</p>\n<p>Although Pink Drainer is retiring, there are still other popular active wallet drainers. Keeping substantial funds in hardware wallets is highly recommended, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🚨💰 According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@zachxbt</a>, Pink Drainer is shutting down after siphoning off over $75M from around 20k victims in just a year. <a href=\"https://t.co/eg1AUjHJwl\">pic.twitter.com/eg1AUjHJwl</a></p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1791291986324103295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<h4><a href=\"https://mp-weixin-qq-com.translate.goog/s/84lUaNSGo4lhQlpnCVUHfQ?_x_tr_sl=auto&#x26;_x_tr_tl=en&#x26;_x_tr_hl=en&#x26;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">Lazarus(APT-Q-1) Secret Stealing Operation</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Lazarus, an APT group, has been active since 2007, gaining notoriety for its 2014 Sony Pictures attack. Initially focusing on government agencies to steal intelligence, it shifted in 2014 towards targeting global financial institutions and virtual currency trading venues, engaging in the theft of money and assets. The group has employed phishing attacks through fake social accounts that offer bogus job opportunities to individuals in specific industries. Recently, security researchers uncovered a series of attacks involving ZIP files with malicious JS code targeting blockchain developers through job postings on platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and Braintrust. These attacks, consistent with Lazarus's \"Contagious Interview\" campaign, involve tricking candidates into running malicious code that steals crypto-related information and implants malware.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against phishing and malware attacks like those executed by groups such as Lazarus, it's crucial to verify the legitimacy of unexpected job offers through independent research and to maintain robust digital hygiene. This includes using up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security, and exercising caution with email attachments and links from unknown sources. Additionally, keeping all software updated is essential to guard against exploitable vulnerabilities. By adopting these practices, individuals can significantly bolster their defenses against sophisticated cyber threats and safeguard their sensitive information</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/etherscan/status/1788550675993174409\">Address Poisoning Attacks on the Rise, leading a recent victim to a $68M Loss</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Address poisoning is a deceptive tactic where attackers manipulate victims' transaction histories to trick them into sending funds to the wrong address. This method involves creating fake tokens, using 'vanity' addresses that closely resemble the target's, and exploiting the ERC-20 token standard's \"transferFrom()\" function. Attackers employ these strategies to conduct zero-value token transfers and spoofed token transfers, making their fraudulent addresses appear legitimate. These attacks are designed to confuse users into copying the wrong address for their transactions, leading to financial losses. The sophistication of these methods highlights the evolving nature of cyber threats in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against address poisoning, users should avoid copying addresses directly from their transaction history and instead, copy them from a trusted source. Implementing domain names for addresses can enhance distinguishability, though users must be cautious of domain name spoofing. Utilizing an address book feature provided by wallet services or adding a private name tag on platforms like Etherscan to whitelist trusted addresses can help users easily identify and avoid spoofed addresses.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: May 2024","metaDescription":"2024 is flying by!
