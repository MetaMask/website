One: a plugin to an existing tool (like webpack) to create a compartment map and transformed sources and save it as an app archive. Two: a bundler capable of turning an app archive into a secure bundle file. With that approach, adding support for a new bundling tool/ecosystem should require less work and be less likely to undermine the security aspects of the bundler. <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs/endo/pull/1449\">https://github.com/endojs/endo/pull/1449</a></li>\n<li>Added attenuation for globals in policy.

In the interest of striking an appropriate balance between user protection and user autonomy, MetaMask has disabled eth_sign by default but will allow you to toggle it back on in the advanced settings. You can read more about it in our <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/17308\">extension PR</a>.</p>\n<p>Recently, Devin Shin, a technical support engineer for MetaMask, reported:\n“I was working with a user on a security ticket and wanted to share this. They provided me with an obvious scam site which I investigated. At first, I was confused as to the vector of phishing because nothing was happening while trying to interact with the site. I checked the console logs, and it was clear that the site attempted to prompt an <code>eth_sign</code> txn, which failed due to the recent change. Happy to see this change having a positive effect!”</p>\n<p>Ding Dong, The Monkey Drainer is Dead!

This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful combination. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks or buy crypto with fiat.
