MetaMask and Blockaid developed a privacy-preserving module to simulate transactions while removing the need for users to share data with third parties. Based on previous trends, when available to 100% of the MetaMask users, these alerts aim to prevent billions worth of assets from being stolen.</p>\n<h3>🚧What We’ve Been Working On🚧</h3>\n<br /> \n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/discussions/723\">Open Beta of the LavaMoat Webpack Plugin</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>We want to encourage developers to try out the plugin and report any incompatibilities with the webpack config or tools you use.\nIt should be plug-and-play with some configurations of what to exclude when processing assets to avoid clashing with the css-extract plugins and such.</p>\n<p>Open Beta is the only time where you can get free direct support on your LavaMoat integration, so don't hesitate to get in touch!\nStart a discussion thread here if you're trying it out and share your experience and showcase results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/discussions/723\">https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/discussions/723</a>\n<a href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/@lavamoat/webpack\">https://npmjs.com/package/@lavamoat/webpack</a></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/midwitmilhouse/status/1716893167184966069?s=46&#x26;t=jBELT-4pGKlkq4e7X7vjdg\">X(FKA Twitter) Space: Web3 Security and the Forta Snap</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Christian Montoya from MetaMask Snaps joins Christian Seifert and Andrew Beal from Forta to discuss web3 security and the Forta transaction insight Snap.</p>\n<p><em>“The purpose of the Forta Snap is to protect you from scams.

Fantom initially broke the news in their Telegram channel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1714282750830928176\">claiming the fund loss was the result of a Chrome zero-day exploit</a>, but have not released any supporting evidence.

Since this fund loss incident impacted multiple wallets at the same date and time, we can determine that it was unlikely for each key holder to have fallen victim to a phishing attack on the same date and time. Fantom later disclosed in an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1714337765502992798\">official statement on X</a> saying that only 550K out of the total $7 million stolen belonged to Fantom Foundation, but never gave any new details shedding light on how the attack occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>How users can protect themselves</strong></p>\n<p>User’s funds are safe as this hack only affected employee wallets. I would still advise user’s to keep a close watch on Fantom Foundation and how they handle this situation.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. Our More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across the ecosystem.</strong></p>\n<p>HyperPlay was founded to build a secure, censorship-resistant, free-market gaming platform. We were, and still are, driven by offering greater flexibility and ownership than the web2 paradigm, while also providing a safer cross-platform experience. Thanks to our efforts, today we are entering a new era of gaming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/15BcZsL1lavnanKVEvyfz3/14eb170ac038e038d21f4438dfb14dcf/image1.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay MetaMask onboarding screen\"></p>\n<h2>Replacing the old formula</h2>\n<p>While the web2 gaming world continues to cling to its old ways, <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay’s</a> web3-friendly game store allows players to carry their in-game assets across all games, offering them <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/@hyperplay/game-asset-ownership-matters-%E2%80%94-heres-why\">true ownership</a> and autonomy, without fear of de-platforming. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet</a> is a key integration, eliminating obstacles for gamers and developers alike.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/how-hyperplay-is-building-a-web3-game-store-with-the-metamask-developer/\">game store</a> brings token swaps, cross-chain bridging, and easy cash to crypto on-ramping into every game through our in-game overlay. This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful partnership. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks, or buy crypto with fiat. The future of gaming is now.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave outdated gaming platforms behind and immerse yourself in web3 gaming by exploring <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/downloads\">HyperPlay</a> today.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Find out how MetaMask and HyperPlay are ushering in a new era of web3 gaming that is secure and powerful.
