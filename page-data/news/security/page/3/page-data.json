This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>.

It can be used to implement frontend-only components that exclusively allow interactions with the user and trusted code, while blocking access attempts by untrusted JavaScript and CSS code in the app. The intention is to use it for “defense in depth” and protect the most critical content we display in LavaMoat-protected apps in case all other protections have been defeated.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aw_blrX8iQ?si=jAqGvbBvleO7WtvR\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h4>More from LavaMoat</h4>\n<br /> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/959\">Merged</a> policy generation in LavaMoat webpack plugin.

SEAL represents a joint endeavor by the cybersecurity community to enhance safety within the crypto ecosystem. It has been operating quietly for a while, leading notable efforts such as SEAL 911 (a rapid-response help desk staffed by leading security experts) and SEAL Drills (which offers attack simulation training).</p>\n<p>The alliance has also announced its Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement, which acts as a framework for ethical hackers and MEV bots that intervene in public security incidents. In compliance with all aspects of the agreement, they are permitted to preemptively address exploits, provided that any funds are redirected to a specified location and an active attack is in progress.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://t.me/investigations/94\">22+ LastPass Hack Victims Lose 6.2M in Crypto Assets</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>@Zachxbt and @Tayvano have identified additional victims of the LastPass hack in <a href=\"https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\">December 2022</a>.

Since the initial LastPass attack, various crypto community members, including protocol founders, investors, developers, and users who stored their seed phrases on LastPass, have experienced significant financial losses exceeding 10 million.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>If you were a LastPass user before the hack in December 2022, your digital assets may be at greater risk of theft due to compromised seed phrases or keys. We recommend transferring your balances to a new wallet. For further security, users with substantial funds should consider cold storage options such as hardware wallets, which require physical access to use their funds.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"1r5RVyx4leMN49kQ5TPKq2","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: January 2024","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-january-2024","subtitle":"Happy new year, security-minded folks!

The email service provider MailerLite, allegedly hacked, is currently investigating the issue. The phishing emails contained malicious links leading to a multi-chain address. WalletConnect and other Web3 users have been targeted with emails promoting a launchpad launch and a fake Token Terminal beta launch, both containing links to fictitious airdrops.

This is a common campaign that scammers with a good understanding of Ethereum smart contracts use to spoof Etherscan logs. The scam involves sending airdrops that appear to come from reputable sources to token holders, who are then directed to a fraudulent website where they are tricked into authorizing the attacker to drain their wallets. The scam is sophisticated, utilizing complex smart contract interactions and a proxy contract to obfuscate the true nature of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should approach unsolicited airdrops with caution, scrutinize embedded links in digital assets, and understand the implications of interacting with smart contracts. Users should stay informed about scam tactics, use trusted tools for verifying transactions, and double-check sources of airdrops or transactions. Safe browsing practices and securing assets, such as using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, are recommended. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, education, caution, and skepticism remain key defenses against potential threats.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://securelist.com/new-macos-backdoor-crypto-stealer/111778/\">Cracked Software Loaded with Backdoors to Steal Cryptocurrency</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Kaspersky discovered a sophisticated macOS malware campaign that targets users through cracked apps found on pirating websites. The malware, embedded in repackaged pre-cracked applications, initiates an infection through a Trojan proxy and a post-install script. The malware is capable of running on macOS Ventura 13.6 and later, suggesting a focus on users of newer operating systems. The malware uses a program named \"Activator\" to execute its payload, which includes stealing cryptocurrency wallets. The malware campaign is still a work-in-progress, with the operators frequently updating the malicious scripts. The final payload is a backdoor that can run any scripts with administrator privileges and replace Exodus and Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet applications with infected versions that steal secret recovery phrases.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To safeguard against malware attacks, users should strictly download and install applications from official platforms or trusted third-party app stores, avoiding unverified or pirating websites. It's crucial to keep your operating system and all applications updated, as updates often include security patches that guard against known vulnerabilities. Utilizing reliable antivirus or anti-malware software, which should be regularly updated, can help detect and eliminate many types of malware.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2NvoU7gEQJDZWDy4BXzNR5","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: December 2023","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-december-2023","subtitle":"As we wrap up the year, we take a look at how MetaMask is pushing security with LavaMoat and Snaps, as well as our presence at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit.","image":{"title":"security december","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=webp 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=webp 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=webp 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=256&h=144&q=80&fm=png 256w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=512&h=288&q=80&fm=png 512w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4ZwyR5fGdMAJrBscuKmkCf/87999dc83644b3c0294b90cb2a463b69/security_december_.png?w=1024&h=576&q=80&fm=png 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"December 22, 2023","authors":[{"name":"Luker","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aEthpENXzja2qP3R0E0cD/ffee94fb91f687e63cf41989a25fb811/Screenshot_2023-12-22_at_4.01.13_PM.png\" alt=\"john nash \">\n<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.\">John Nash</a>: Mathematician known for his fundamental contributions to GameTheory.</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/security/lavamoat-and-the-ledger-software-supply-chain-attack/\">LavaMoat and the Ledger Software Supply Chain Attack</a></h3>\n<br /> \n<p>By now you’ve likely heard about the attack on Ledger Connect Kit that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1735292040986886648\">estimated by researcher ZackXBT</a> to have drained the equivalent of over USD 610,000 from users.

This attack compromised their npm credentials. npm, or Node Package Manager, is a tool for importing open-source software libraries, broadly used across the web development industry, as well as web3.</p>\n<p>This attack allowed a malicious version of the library in question to be published. This library is included in a live-updating manner via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in many web apps in the Ethereum ecosystem. This resulted in malicious code being injected into those web apps.</p>\n<h2>How do we prevent this? LavaMoat.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat\">LavaMoat</a> is a set of tools built specifically to help address the software supply chain security issues web application developers face.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat offers protections against supply chain attacks at three different points in the software development lifecycle: <strong>at the time of dependency install</strong> (when you’re importing all those libraries), <strong>at build time</strong> (when the app is being prepared for serving over the Internet), <strong>and at runtime</strong> (when the built application is running).</p>\n<p>LavaMoat is unique in its <strong>runtime protections</strong>. There are other tools that can be used during development, such as <a href=\"https://snyk.io/\">snyk.io</a>, which only provides warnings of known vulnerabilities, or <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>, which provides more comprehensive code analysis, and does not wait for experts to report findings to a central database. <strong>These scanning tools perform an invaluable role</strong>, and we recommend you use <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>’s GitHub Integration.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>they are unable to provide any runtime guarantees.</strong> For this reason, we find using them alone to be insufficient.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat’s security protections derive from <strong>only delegating specified capabilities</strong> to dependencies of your application.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? Well, read on, and check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Bz0DYga1k&#x26;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation\">Devcon 6 talk</a> for a deeper understanding of how LavaMoat works and how it is used.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5Bz0DYga1k?si=xqyZEWdI7k1arwZf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>An Object Capability primer</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>You can think of a system having <strong>capabilities</strong>: things it can do, like showing information, reading locally stored data, or making requests to other systems like web requests to servers or transaction requests to wallets, and the ability to <strong>delegate</strong> these capabilities to others.</p>\n<p>When delegating a capability, you can provide a limited or restricted version of the capability. This is known as <strong>attenuation</strong>.</p>\n<p>These three components form the basis of the <strong>object capability security model</strong>. By using this model, you can understand who has the ability to do what.</p>\n<h2>Web application security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Browsers do a decent job of sandboxing applications; that is, keeping them separate and preventing them from interfering with your computer or other websites.</p>\n<p>However, they don't provide robust building blocks for web app developers to further sandbox specific portions of their app, which could keep certain components of their app from compromising the whole application.</p>\n<p>For this reason, when importing a library into your application, you are effectively <strong>delegating all capabilities to that library</strong>. This is further complicated by the fact that <strong>most JavaScript libraries bring in not just their own code but a collection of libraries written by various authors.</strong></p>\n<h2>Ledger attack specifics</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>The <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> library is Ledger’s recommended way of integrating with their products. This package is a thin wrapper that loads the latest version of their library from a CDN.</p>\n<p>While this means your app will always have the latest version of the library it also means __you are effectively delegating control of your web app to the Ledger loader library, which in turn delegates it to the code hosted on the CDN. __</p>\n<p>You can model the delegation chain like this:</p>\n<h4><strong>Web App → <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> → jsDelivr CDN → npm → Ledger → Ledger ex-employee → attacker</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Even this is a simplification. Zooming in on one component, <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic\">such as the jsDeliver CDN</a>, can reveal a dazzling complexity of additional services that are also part of the supplychain and potential footholds for launching an attack.</p>\n<h2>Securing applications with Object Capability Security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>While browsers themselves don't provide much tooling, as mentioned, for limiting the capabilities of subcomponents of an application, the JavaScript language is actually well suited for the task.</p>\n<p>JavaScript, with some careful effort, allows you to build Compartments, which limit what code is allowed to access. See Agoric’s <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses\">Hardened Javascript</a> effort for an implementation of Compartments.</p>\n<h4><strong>MetaMask’s <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/\">LavaMoat</a> supply chain security system and the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a> plugin system both build on Compartments to achieve confinement.</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7nIGWogOGAO7RpDLKoqcyS/f83a7d548ee2e47734c74865becb7d25/lavamoat_mystic_1.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0px;\">\n<br />\n<h2>Would LavaMoat have prevented the Ledger supplychain attack?</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Asking if LavaMoat would have prevented it is kinda like asking if the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SYLAi4jwXcs?t=140\">stop-when-touched feature</a> on a table saw would help if you held on to the saw while jumping off a cliff - yes, your fingers would likely remain attached to your hand after the jump.</p>\n<p>In principle, the way <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> works forces the app developer to forgo many of established security best practices. But not all hope is lost.</p>\n<p>The best way to let LavaMoat (and other supply-chain security tools) help you would be to use the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit directly</code>, without handing all control off to the loader.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat was designed to mitigate attacks like the <a href=\"https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-event-stream-incident-45653ecbda99\">Copay wallet hack</a>, also known as “the event-stream incident”, and protects well against it. So, how does LavaMoat fare against this different attack?</p>\n<p>The answer is, unfortunately, the age old “it depends”. LavaMoat is a tool for application developers, not library developers, due to the way it integrates in the app runtime. This means that while some webapps could have protected themselves with LavaMoat, applications without\nLavaMoat would still be vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Additionally, LavaMoat only enforces a policy specified by the developers. <strong>If you specify an unsafe policy, LavaMoat will not be able to protect you.</strong></p>\n<h2>Let's look at how an application with LavaMoat could have been protected from this attack.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>LavaMoat uses a policy file to determine what capabilities, in the form of global platform APIs, a dependency should get. To make this easier, you can have LavaMoat analyze a package and automatically determine what a package seems to need in order to operate. This is known as <strong>static analysis.</strong></p>\n<p>While static analysis is an imperfect means of understanding what some code is trying to do,  <strong>LavaMoat only uses static analysis for convenience</strong> to help you generate a policy file. It does not use static analysis to enforce its policies at runtime. The generated policies are then reviewed, tweaked, and approved by the developer.</p>\n<p>For the original question, one answer is: <strong>Yes, LavaMoat can protect your app and your users from supply chain attacks</strong>, by preventing packages from having the capability to load new code at runtime. It can protect you if you have configured it correctly and if you used dependencies that don’t demand overly powerful capabilities.</p>\n<p>Another answer is: No. <strong>If you had configured LavaMoat to allow <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to operate normally and <a href=\"https://github.com/LedgerHQ/connect-kit/blob/e4e5f5bb3ca13a28921d7357778f132e22ae4c49/packages/connect-kit-loader/src/index.ts#L98-L107\">inject a script tag</a> running any code it likes</strong> outside of the LavaMoat runtime, <strong>the attack still would have succeeded.</strong> This is part of LavaMoat’s compromise between backwards compatibility and a safer system. LavaMoat is very flexible in order to be maximally compatible, so you can drop it in your app without rewriting it from scratch. The responsibility is still on the app developer to set sensible policies and choose sensible dependencies. LavaMoat allows you to selectively provide global browser APIs, but some global APIs simply contain too much power to safely give to a third party package. We’re researching a few different means of further limiting these powers, but making something that just works for packages that make no effort to limit their control is challenging.</p>\n<p>One of LavaMoat’s features, called <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/blob/main/docs/scuttling.md\">Scuttling</a>, would interfere with both the malicious and the original package as loaded by the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code>. Scuttling removes access to capabilities for code running outside the LavaMoat sandbox. This would prevent you from using the unsafe <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to begin with, and push you towards directly using and thus owning the process of updating <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit</code>, ensuring you maintain full control of the code run in your app.</p>\n<h4>While LavaMoat is not a silver bullet, it gives you control and visibility where you would otherwise have none.
