Attackers compromised devices with malware to execute unauthorized transactions. This incident, focusing on the development team, emphasizes the extreme measures threat actors will take, and the importance of vigilance in cybersecurity best practices.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To enhance personal security and mitigate the risk of similar attacks, users should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid blind signing: Always understand and verify the details of any transaction before signing, mainly when using hardware wallets. Blind signing can expose users to unauthorized transactions crafted by attackers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow official announcements: Stay updated with official communications from trusted platforms.

These schemes, documented in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, involve various deceptive practices, including reluctance to appear on camera. Part of a broader campaign to generate revenue for North Korea, these activities have been associated with the NICKEL TAPESTRY threat group, and contribute to the country's weapons programs. Recent operations, such as the Contagious Interview campaign, involve elaborate fake interview processes delivering malware to job candidates in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. The U.S. Justice Department has also highlighted a multi-year IT worker fraud scheme generating significant revenue for North Korea and evading sanctions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations can protect themselves from these sophisticated fraud schemes by implementing thorough verification processes for candidate identities, including checks on documentation and conducting in-person or video interviews. Monitoring for unusual behavior during interviews can also help identify potential fraud. Employers should be cautious of requests to change addresses or route payments to money transfer services during onboarding. Additionally, IT staff should limit unauthorized remote access tools, and restrict access to non-essential systems, mitigating the risk of intellectual property theft and unauthorized revenue generation for North Korea.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/angel-drainer-takes-over-infernos-tools/\">Inferno drainer hands over reigns to Angel Drainer</a></h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The crypto security landscape faces a potential escalation as Inferno Drainer, a notorious service known for facilitating crypto wallet thefts, has transferred its operations to Angel Drainer. This move could mark a new, more dangerous phase in crypto-draining activities. Inferno's decision to hand over its platform, including its extensive code base and features, to Angel Drainer is based on confidence in Angel's capability to manage and maintain the service. This transition is expected to keep clients' existing functionalities intact. Still, it raises concerns about the strengthened capabilities of wallet drainers, which have already contributed to significant losses in the crypto community.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Given the growing threats in the crypto-draining ecosystem, individuals should exercise increased caution. Protecting oneself involves being vigilant about phishing attempts, often through fake social media accounts and websites. Users should double-check the authenticity of any crypto-related communication, and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Implementing robust security measures for crypto wallets, such as using hardware wallets and enabling multi-factor authentication, can provide additional layers of protection. Staying informed about the latest security threats and following best practices recommended by crypto security experts can help mitigate the risk of falling victim to sophisticated drainers.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"MetaMask’s

free-market gaming platform. We were, and still are, driven by offering greater flexibility and ownership than the web2 paradigm, and also providing a more accessible, safe cross-platform experience. Thanks to our efforts, today we are entering a new era of gaming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/15BcZsL1lavnanKVEvyfz3/14eb170ac038e038d21f4438dfb14dcf/image1.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay MetaMask onboarding screen\"></p>\n<h2>Replacing the old formula</h2>\n<p>While the web2 gaming world continues to cling to its old ways, <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay’s</a> web3-friendly game store allows players to carry their in-game assets across all games, offering them <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/@hyperplay/game-asset-ownership-matters-%E2%80%94-heres-why\">true ownership</a> and autonomy, without fear of de-platforming. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet</a> is a key integration, eliminating obstacles for gamers and developers alike.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/how-hyperplay-is-building-a-web3-game-store-with-the-metamask-developer/\">game store</a> brings token swaps, cross-chain bridging, and easy cash to crypto on-ramping into every game through our in-game overlay. This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful combination. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks or buy crypto with fiat. The future of gaming is now.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave outdated gaming platforms behind and immerse yourself in web3 gaming by exploring <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/downloads\">HyperPlay</a> today.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Find out how MetaMask and HyperPlay are ushering in a new era of web3 gaming that is secure and powerful.
