These schemes, documented in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, involve various deceptive practices, including reluctance to appear on camera. Part of a broader campaign to generate revenue for North Korea, these activities have been associated with the NICKEL TAPESTRY threat group, and contribute to the country's weapons programs. Recent operations, such as the Contagious Interview campaign, involve elaborate fake interview processes delivering malware to job candidates in the tech and cryptocurrency sectors. The U.S. Justice Department has also highlighted a multi-year IT worker fraud scheme generating significant revenue for North Korea and evading sanctions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Organizations can protect themselves from these sophisticated fraud schemes by implementing thorough verification processes for candidate identities, including checks on documentation and conducting in-person or video interviews. Monitoring for unusual behavior during interviews can also help identify potential fraud. Employers should be cautious of requests to change addresses or route payments to money transfer services during onboarding. Additionally, IT staff should limit unauthorized remote access tools, and restrict access to non-essential systems, mitigating the risk of intellectual property theft and unauthorized revenue generation for North Korea.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/angel-drainer-takes-over-infernos-tools/\">Inferno drainer hands over reigns to Angel Drainer</a></h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>The crypto security landscape faces a potential escalation as Inferno Drainer, a notorious service known for facilitating crypto wallet thefts, has transferred its operations to Angel Drainer. This move could mark a new, more dangerous phase in crypto-draining activities. Inferno's decision to hand over its platform, including its extensive code base and features, to Angel Drainer is based on confidence in Angel's capability to manage and maintain the service. This transition is expected to keep clients' existing functionalities intact. Still, it raises concerns about the strengthened capabilities of wallet drainers, which have already contributed to significant losses in the crypto community.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Given the growing threats in the crypto-draining ecosystem, individuals should exercise increased caution. Protecting oneself involves being vigilant about phishing attempts, often through fake social media accounts and websites. Users should double-check the authenticity of any crypto-related communication, and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Implementing robust security measures for crypto wallets, such as using hardware wallets and enabling multi-factor authentication, can provide additional layers of protection.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
