crypto ecosystem. Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked. As MetaMask’s phishing detection provider, <a href=\"https://chainpatrol.io/\">ChainPatrol</a> recognized the power of a blocklist approach early on.</p>\n<p>While traditional takedowns are still important, in the worst cases it can take over a day to remove a phishing site entirely. MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1H51TkYG1NHQHa0K9CHsNT/e983121c477c4cde79958c93baaab5be/MetaMask_takedown_time.jpg\" alt=\"MetaMask takedown time\"></p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis. By addressing these threats with speed, users are protected from having their data and wallets compromised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52fcYS0XoMmzrMcPClmA2n/5d826b2547e5e1822f9965016b822080/MetaMask_Threats_Blocked_By_Day_.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Threats Blocked By Day\"></p>\n<p><em>In 2024, ChainPatrol blocked over 29,000 threats targeting Consensys brands including Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
