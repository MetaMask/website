Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 gaming players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ assets.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamers’ responsibility of security their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask is continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
