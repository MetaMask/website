This attack compromised their npm credentials. npm, or Node Package Manager, is a tool for importing open-source software libraries, broadly used across the web development industry, as well as web3.</p>\n<p>This attack allowed a malicious version of the library in question to be published. This library is included in a live-updating manner via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in many web apps in the Ethereum ecosystem. This resulted in malicious code being injected into those web apps.</p>\n<h2>How do we prevent this? LavaMoat.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat\">LavaMoat</a> is a set of tools built specifically to help address the software supply chain security issues web application developers face.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat offers protections against supply chain attacks at three different points in the software development lifecycle: <strong>at the time of dependency install</strong> (when you’re importing all those libraries), <strong>at build time</strong> (when the app is being prepared for serving over the Internet), <strong>and at runtime</strong> (when the built application is running).</p>\n<p>LavaMoat is unique in its <strong>runtime protections</strong>. There are other tools that can be used during development, such as <a href=\"https://snyk.io/\">snyk.io</a>, which only provides warnings of known vulnerabilities, or <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>, which provides more comprehensive code analysis, and does not wait for experts to report findings to a central database. <strong>These scanning tools perform an invaluable role</strong>, and we recommend you use <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>’s GitHub Integration.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>they are unable to provide any runtime guarantees.</strong> For this reason, we find using them alone to be insufficient.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat’s security protections derive from <strong>only delegating specified capabilities</strong> to dependencies of your application.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? Well, read on, and check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Bz0DYga1k&#x26;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation\">Devcon 6 talk</a> for a deeper understanding of how LavaMoat works and how it is used.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5Bz0DYga1k?si=xqyZEWdI7k1arwZf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>An Object Capability primer</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>You can think of a system having <strong>capabilities</strong>: things it can do, like showing information, reading locally stored data, or making requests to other systems like web requests to servers or transaction requests to wallets, and the ability to <strong>delegate</strong> these capabilities to others.</p>\n<p>When delegating a capability, you can provide a limited or restricted version of the capability. This is known as <strong>attenuation</strong>.</p>\n<p>These three components form the basis of the <strong>object capability security model</strong>. By using this model, you can understand who has the ability to do what.</p>\n<h2>Web application security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Browsers do a decent job of sandboxing applications; that is, keeping them separate and preventing them from interfering with your computer or other websites.</p>\n<p>However, they don't provide robust building blocks for web app developers to further sandbox specific portions of their app, which could keep certain components of their app from compromising the whole application.</p>\n<p>For this reason, when importing a library into your application, you are effectively <strong>delegating all capabilities to that library</strong>. This is further complicated by the fact that <strong>most JavaScript libraries bring in not just their own code but a collection of libraries written by various authors.</strong></p>\n<h2>Ledger attack specifics</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>The <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> library is Ledger’s recommended way of integrating with their products. This package is a thin wrapper that loads the latest version of their library from a CDN.</p>\n<p>While this means your app will always have the latest version of the library it also means __you are effectively delegating control of your web app to the Ledger loader library, which in turn delegates it to the code hosted on the CDN. __</p>\n<p>You can model the delegation chain like this:</p>\n<h4><strong>Web App → <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> → jsDelivr CDN → npm → Ledger → Ledger ex-employee → attacker</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Even this is a simplification. Zooming in on one component, <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic\">such as the jsDeliver CDN</a>, can reveal a dazzling complexity of additional services that are also part of the supplychain and potential footholds for launching an attack.</p>\n<h2>Securing applications with Object Capability Security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>While browsers themselves don't provide much tooling, as mentioned, for limiting the capabilities of subcomponents of an application, the JavaScript language is actually well suited for the task.</p>\n<p>JavaScript, with some careful effort, allows you to build Compartments, which limit what code is allowed to access. See Agoric’s <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses\">Hardened Javascript</a> effort for an implementation of Compartments.</p>\n<h4><strong>MetaMask’s <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/\">LavaMoat</a> supply chain security system and the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a> plugin system both build on Compartments to achieve confinement.</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7nIGWogOGAO7RpDLKoqcyS/f83a7d548ee2e47734c74865becb7d25/lavamoat_mystic_1.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0px;\">\n<br />\n<h2>Would LavaMoat have prevented the Ledger supplychain attack?</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Asking if LavaMoat would have prevented it is kinda like asking if the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SYLAi4jwXcs?t=140\">stop-when-touched feature</a> on a table saw would help if you held on to the saw while jumping off a cliff - yes, your fingers would likely remain attached to your hand after the jump.</p>\n<p>In principle, the way <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> works forces the app developer to forgo many of established security best practices. But not all hope is lost.</p>\n<p>The best way to let LavaMoat (and other supply-chain security tools) help you would be to use the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit directly</code>, without handing all control off to the loader.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat was designed to mitigate attacks like the <a href=\"https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-event-stream-incident-45653ecbda99\">Copay wallet hack</a>, also known as “the event-stream incident”, and protects well against it. So, how does LavaMoat fare against this different attack?</p>\n<p>The answer is, unfortunately, the age old “it depends”. LavaMoat is a tool for application developers, not library developers, due to the way it integrates in the app runtime. This means that while some webapps could have protected themselves with LavaMoat, applications without\nLavaMoat would still be vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Additionally, LavaMoat only enforces a policy specified by the developers. <strong>If you specify an unsafe policy, LavaMoat will not be able to protect you.</strong></p>\n<h2>Let's look at how an application with LavaMoat could have been protected from this attack.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>LavaMoat uses a policy file to determine what capabilities, in the form of global platform APIs, a dependency should get. To make this easier, you can have LavaMoat analyze a package and automatically determine what a package seems to need in order to operate. This is known as <strong>static analysis.</strong></p>\n<p>While static analysis is an imperfect means of understanding what some code is trying to do,  <strong>LavaMoat only uses static analysis for convenience</strong> to help you generate a policy file. It does not use static analysis to enforce its policies at runtime. The generated policies are then reviewed, tweaked, and approved by the developer.</p>\n<p>For the original question, one answer is: <strong>Yes, LavaMoat can protect your app and your users from supply chain attacks</strong>, by preventing packages from having the capability to load new code at runtime. It can protect you if you have configured it correctly and if you used dependencies that don’t demand overly powerful capabilities.</p>\n<p>Another answer is: No. <strong>If you had configured LavaMoat to allow <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to operate normally and <a href=\"https://github.com/LedgerHQ/connect-kit/blob/e4e5f5bb3ca13a28921d7357778f132e22ae4c49/packages/connect-kit-loader/src/index.ts#L98-L107\">inject a script tag</a> running any code it likes</strong> outside of the LavaMoat runtime, <strong>the attack still would have succeeded.</strong> This is part of LavaMoat’s compromise between backwards compatibility and a safer system. LavaMoat is very flexible in order to be maximally compatible, so you can drop it in your app without rewriting it from scratch. The responsibility is still on the app developer to set sensible policies and choose sensible dependencies. LavaMoat allows you to selectively provide global browser APIs, but some global APIs simply contain too much power to safely give to a third party package. We’re researching a few different means of further limiting these powers, but making something that just works for packages that make no effort to limit their control is challenging.</p>\n<p>One of LavaMoat’s features, called <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/blob/main/docs/scuttling.md\">Scuttling</a>, would interfere with both the malicious and the original package as loaded by the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code>. Scuttling removes access to capabilities for code running outside the LavaMoat sandbox.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2><strong>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</strong></h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</strong></p>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2><strong>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</strong></h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
