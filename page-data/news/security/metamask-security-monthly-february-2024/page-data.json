This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>.

It can be used to implement frontend-only components that exclusively allow interactions with the user and trusted code, while blocking access attempts by untrusted JavaScript and CSS code in the app. The intention is to use it for “defense in depth” and protect the most critical content we display in LavaMoat-protected apps in case all other protections have been defeated.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aw_blrX8iQ?si=jAqGvbBvleO7WtvR\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h4>More from LavaMoat</h4>\n<br /> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/959\">Merged</a> policy generation in LavaMoat webpack plugin.

SEAL represents a joint endeavor by the cybersecurity community to enhance safety within the crypto ecosystem. It has been operating quietly for a while, leading notable efforts such as SEAL 911 (a rapid-response help desk staffed by leading security experts) and SEAL Drills (which offers attack simulation training).</p>\n<p>The alliance has also announced its Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement, which acts as a framework for ethical hackers and MEV bots that intervene in public security incidents. In compliance with all aspects of the agreement, they are permitted to preemptively address exploits, provided that any funds are redirected to a specified location and an active attack is in progress.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://t.me/investigations/94\">22+ LastPass Hack Victims Lose 6.2M in Crypto Assets</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>@Zachxbt and @Tayvano have identified additional victims of the LastPass hack in <a href=\"https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\">December 2022</a>. Between February 19th and 20th, over 22 victims of the LastPass hack suffered losses totaling US$6.2 million. The stolen funds were quickly transferred from EVM chains to Bitcoin. Details of the theft addresses are documented in a <a href=\"https://www.chainabuse.com/report/ff7c260c-88e2-4d1b-a386-efe448b737e2\">Chainabuse report</a>. Since the initial LastPass attack, various crypto community members, including protocol founders, investors, developers, and users who stored their seed phrases on LastPass, have experienced significant financial losses exceeding 10 million.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>If you were a LastPass user before the hack in December 2022, your digital assets may be at greater risk of theft due to compromised seed phrases or keys. We recommend transferring your balances to a new wallet. For further security, users with substantial funds should consider cold storage options such as hardware wallets, which require physical access to use their

crypto ecosystem. Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked. As MetaMask’s phishing detection provider, <a href=\"https://chainpatrol.io/\">ChainPatrol</a> recognized the power of a blocklist approach early on.</p>\n<p>While traditional takedowns are still important, in the worst cases it can take over a day to remove a phishing site entirely. MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1H51TkYG1NHQHa0K9CHsNT/e983121c477c4cde79958c93baaab5be/MetaMask_takedown_time.jpg\" alt=\"MetaMask takedown time\">\n<em>Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of detection on MetaMask.</em></p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet.
