This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>.

It can be used to implement frontend-only components that exclusively allow interactions with the user and trusted code, while blocking access attempts by untrusted JavaScript and CSS code in the app. The intention is to use it for “defense in depth” and protect the most critical content we display in LavaMoat-protected apps in case all other protections have been defeated.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aw_blrX8iQ?si=jAqGvbBvleO7WtvR\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h4>More from LavaMoat</h4>\n<br /> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/959\">Merged</a> policy generation in LavaMoat webpack plugin.

SEAL represents a joint endeavor by the cybersecurity community to enhance safety within the crypto ecosystem. It has been operating quietly for a while, leading notable efforts such as SEAL 911 (a rapid-response help desk staffed by leading security experts) and SEAL Drills (which offers attack simulation training).</p>\n<p>The alliance has also announced its Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement, which acts as a framework for ethical hackers and MEV bots that intervene in public security incidents. In compliance with all aspects of the agreement, they are permitted to preemptively address exploits, provided that any funds are redirected to a specified location and an active attack is in progress.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://t.me/investigations/94\">22+ LastPass Hack Victims Lose 6.2M in Crypto Assets</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>@Zachxbt and @Tayvano have identified additional victims of the LastPass hack in <a href=\"https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\">December 2022</a>. Between February 19th and 20th, over 22 victims of the LastPass hack suffered losses totaling US$6.2 million. The stolen funds were quickly transferred from EVM chains to Bitcoin. Details of the theft addresses are documented in a <a href=\"https://www.chainabuse.com/report/ff7c260c-88e2-4d1b-a386-efe448b737e2\">Chainabuse report</a>.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamer responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets.
