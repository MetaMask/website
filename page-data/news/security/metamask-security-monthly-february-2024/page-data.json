This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>. We eagerly await your <a href=\"https://feedback.metamask.io/account-management-snaps\">feedback</a>!</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaDome?tab=readme-ov-file#readme\">Introducing LavaDome</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaDome?tab=readme-ov-file#readme\">LavaDome</a> is the newest <em><strong>experimental</strong></em> tool in the LavaMoat toolbox for supply chain security, which utilizes the ShadowDom web API. It can be used to implement frontend-only components that exclusively allow interactions with the user and trusted code, while blocking access attempts by untrusted JavaScript and CSS code in the app. The intention is to use it for “defense in depth” and protect the most critical content we display in LavaMoat-protected apps in case all other protections have been defeated.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aw_blrX8iQ?si=jAqGvbBvleO7WtvR\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h4>More from LavaMoat</h4>\n<br /> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/959\">Merged</a> policy generation in LavaMoat webpack plugin.

SEAL represents a joint endeavor by the cybersecurity community to enhance safety within the crypto ecosystem. It has been operating quietly for a while, leading notable efforts such as SEAL 911 (a rapid-response help desk staffed by leading security experts) and SEAL Drills (which offers attack simulation training).</p>\n<p>The alliance has also announced its Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement, which acts as a framework for ethical hackers and MEV bots that intervene in public security incidents. In compliance with all aspects of the agreement, they are permitted to preemptively address exploits, provided that any funds are redirected to a specified location and an active attack is in progress.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents.

Details of the theft addresses are documented in a <a href=\"https://www.chainabuse.com/report/ff7c260c-88e2-4d1b-a386-efe448b737e2\">Chainabuse report</a>. Since the initial LastPass attack, various crypto community members, including protocol founders, investors, developers, and users who stored their seed phrases on LastPass, have experienced significant financial losses exceeding 10 million.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>If you were a LastPass user before the hack in December 2022, your digital assets may be at greater risk of theft due to compromised seed phrases or keys. We recommend transferring your balances to a new wallet. For further security, users with substantial funds should consider cold storage options such as hardware wallets, which require physical access to use their funds.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Security","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.
