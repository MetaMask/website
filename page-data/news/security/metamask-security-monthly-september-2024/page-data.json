The duo, employing sophisticated tactics and online aliases, are accused of accessing and laundering over 4,100 Bitcoin since August. Their extravagant expenditures included international trips, luxury items, and high-end Los Angeles and Miami rentals. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT highlighted their \"highly sophisticated social engineering attack, \"which involved impersonating support staff from Google and Gemini exchange to deceive the victim into compromising their Bitcoin keys. The stolen funds were dispersed across multiple exchanges, encompassing a complex web of transactions involving Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero. However, in leaked videos showing the attack in progress and efforts to hide the stolen funds, the alleged attackers inadvertently exposed their own identities and the details of their money laundering operation.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security on all sensitive accounts and be wary of any requests to reset or disable it, especially from unsolicited calls or messages.

These services falsely advertised their ability to trace and recover lost cryptocurrency funds, often demanding substantial upfront fees and additional commissions without delivering on their promises.

Be skeptical of services that require upfront payments, or boast unrealistic success rates without verifiable track records. Always verify the authenticity of individuals claiming to offer recoveryservices, especially if they allege connections to legal or financial institutions. If approached by someone promising to recover stolen cryptocurrency, refrain from sharing personal or financial information and avoid making any payments.

The group, consisting of 13 co-conspirators, stole 3.5 million in Bitcoin and other digital assets through brute force, SIM-swapping attacks, and holding victims at gunpoint in Florida. St Felix was convicted on multiple counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, and wire fraud, and was ordered to pay 524,000 in restitution. The criminal activities spanned across the United States, from Texas to New York, between September 2022 and July 2023. The crew also engaged in laundering the stolen funds using decentralized finance tools. A co-conspirator, Jarod Gabriel Seemungal, received a 20-year sentence and was ordered to pay $4 million in restitution. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, played a crucial role in bringing the perpetrators to justice.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Individuals should enhance their digital security practices. This includes using strong, unique passwords for all accounts, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious of sharing personal information online. Additionally, consider using non-custodial wallets to store significant amounts of cryptocurrencies, as they are less vulnerable to online hacking attempts like SIM-swapping. This incident is a reminder that cryptocurrency holders, like those with traditional fiat, may face physical security threats.</p>\n<h1><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></p></h1>\n<h2><a href=\"https://x.com/MitchellAmador/status/1828110931718758690\">The Real Impact of an Onchain Hack: A Comprehensive Study of Hack Damage from 2021 to 2023</a></h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Immunefi's Mitchell Amador talks about the challenges and opportunities in blockchain security and bug bounties.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?
