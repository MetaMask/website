The duo, employing sophisticated tactics and online aliases, are accused of accessing and laundering over 4,100 Bitcoin since August. Their extravagant expenditures included international trips, luxury items, and high-end Los Angeles and Miami rentals. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT highlighted their \"highly sophisticated social engineering attack, \"which involved impersonating support staff from Google and Gemini exchange to deceive the victim into compromising their Bitcoin keys. The stolen funds were dispersed across multiple exchanges, encompassing a complex web of transactions involving Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Monero. However, in leaked videos showing the attack in progress and efforts to hide the stolen funds, the alleged attackers inadvertently exposed their own identities and the details of their money laundering operation.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security on all sensitive accounts and be wary of any requests to reset or disable it, especially from unsolicited calls or messages.

These services falsely advertised their ability to trace and recover lost cryptocurrency funds, often demanding substantial upfront fees and additional commissions without delivering on their promises. Utilizing social media and fake reviews, these fraudulent companies have exploited victims' hopes of reclaiming their lost assets, further entrenching them in financial loss.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Exercise caution and conduct thorough research on any cryptocurrency recovery service. Be skeptical of services that require upfront payments, or boast unrealistic success rates without verifiable track records. Always verify the authenticity of individuals claiming to offer recoveryservices, especially if they allege connections to legal or financial institutions. If approached by someone promising to recover stolen cryptocurrency, refrain from sharing personal or financial information and avoid making any payments. Victims of such schemes are encouraged to report their experiences to <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/\">ic3.gov</a> to help combat these fraudulent activities.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://decrypt.co/249637/florida-man-47-years-prison-bitcoin-home-invasion-ring\">Home Invasions to Steal Bitcoin Result in a 47 Year Prison Sentence</a></h3>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Remy St Felix, a 24-year-old from Florida, was sentenced to 47 years in prison for leading a criminal group in a series of violent home invasions targeting cryptocurrency owners. The group, consisting of 13 co-conspirators, stole 3.5 million in Bitcoin and other digital assets through brute force, SIM-swapping attacks, and holding victims at gunpoint in Florida. St Felix was convicted on multiple counts, including conspiracy, kidnapping, and wire fraud, and was ordered to pay 524,000 in restitution. The criminal activities spanned across the United States, from Texas to New York, between September 2022 and July 2023. The crew also engaged in laundering the stolen funds using decentralized finance tools. A co-conspirator, Jarod Gabriel Seemungal, received a 20-year sentence and was ordered to pay $4 million in restitution. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, played a crucial role in bringing the perpetrators to justice.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Individuals should enhance their digital security practices. This includes using strong, unique passwords for all accounts, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious of sharing personal information online. Additionally, consider using non-custodial wallets to store significant amounts of cryptocurrencies, as they are less vulnerable to online hacking attempts like SIM-swapping. This incident is a reminder that cryptocurrency holders, like those with traditional fiat, may face physical security threats.</p>\n<h2>Meanwhile...</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://x.com/MitchellAmador/status/1828110931718758690\">The Real Impact of an Onchain Hack: A Comprehensive Study of Hack Damage from 2021 to 2023</a></h3>\n<p>Immunefi's Mitchell Amador talks about the challenges and opportunities in blockchain security and bug bounties.

Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful partnership. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks, or buy crypto with fiat. The future of gaming is now.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave outdated gaming platforms behind and immerse yourself in web3 gaming by exploring <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/downloads\">HyperPlay</a> today.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Find out how MetaMask and HyperPlay are ushering in a new era of web3 gaming that is secure and powerful.
