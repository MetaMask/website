Along with breaking down the hack and tips on how to protect yourself, Taylor explores the concepts of “code is law” and “blockchain is immutable.”</p>\n<p>This likely group of attackers used an unusual system, in that they swapped the assets that they were stealing within the victim’s wallet first before sending them to a DEX. The method used to breach the security of 300 individuals who had their recovery phrases exposed remains unknown, and it is assumed that the attack was not typical phishing activity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Taylor summarizes the evolution and current state of offenses and counter offenses in the space, as well as recommendations on how to be more secure, including using a hardware wallet and decentralizing your holdings by keeping them in multiple wallets.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMA2H3ZepT8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h4>Wallet Drain and Seedphrase Compromises</h4>\n<br /> \n<p>If your wallet does get drained, you don’t have to be a security research expert to try and figure out how. @Jon_HQ posted a thorough checklist on Twitter that can guide you through your own investigation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Getting your wallet drained sucks, but getting drained and not knowing how is even worse.<br><br>The following thread is a checklist of things to review if you get drained and can&#39;t figure out how.<br><br>This thread is best bookmarked and referred to later if you ever need it. <a href=\"https://t.co/9K8vK1UPfF\">pic.twitter.com/9K8vK1UPfF</a></p>&mdash; Jon_HQ (@Jon_HQ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jon_HQ/status/1654186790583173120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>🔍 Imposters 🔎</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>From the FTC: <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/05/those-urgent-emails-metamask-and-paypal-are-phishing-scams\">Those urgent emails from MetaMask and PayPal are phishing scams</a></strong></p>\n<p>A consumer alert from the Federal Trade Commission warned the public to be extra cautious about messages supposedly from services related to crypto.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamer responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently.
