These researchers uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before bad actors are able to exploit them. However, as the Security Alliance (SEAL) <a href=\"https://securityalliance.notion.site/Introducing-the-First-Legal-Defense-Fund-to-Support-Crypto-Whitehats-e6792614a5b34c9f9f3f529caf975750\">recently explained</a>, web2’s history shows that “this important work can sometimes lead to significant legal risks and subsequent costs, particularly when their research and disclosures are unwelcome or misunderstood.” Therefore, SEAL has launched an initiative with the Security Research Legal Defense Fund to provide legal resources to eligible researchers who use the <a href=\"https://github.com/security-alliance/safe-harbor\">Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement</a>.</p>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1804708942981091516\">User Loses $11M to Signature Phishing</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On June 22nd, a user signed multiple permit phishing signatures, which resulted in a loss of US$11 million worth of tokens. It was further revealed that the victim was a MakerDAO governance delegate. SEAL researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1795055077209579838\">Pcaversaccio believes signature phishing is the biggest problem in our industry</a>, stating users don’t care about the warnings and they consider the consequences of signing them. <a href=\"https://dune.com/tayvano/sha-zhu-pan\">MetaMask's @tayvano revealed a total estimate of $600M+ in damages from approval phishing scams since 2021.</a></p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users can protect themselves by following three primary steps. (1) Limit the assets of the wallet you browse daily with. If you sign a malicious signature, the impact will be minimized. (2) Validate the domain the signature request originates from and verify it matches the domain of the original project. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the project's official social media or blog page and check that the domains from these profiles match the request. (3) Validate the token and address contents of the request. The request will often involve a token you did not intend to send. The <code>spender</code> address and or the <code>to</code> address of the transactions will be different than the address you intended. These simple checks can save you from unintended fund loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/299099/attacker-sends-nearly-24000-phishing-emails-derived-from-compromised-coingecko-third-party-email-platform\"><strong>23K Phishing Emails Sent After CoinGeko's 3rd-Party Email Service is Compromised</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, experienced a data breach on June 5 due to a compromised account at their third-party email marketing platform, GetResponse. An attacker accessed nearly 2 million contacts and sent 23,723 phishing emails from another client's account within GetResponse. The breach exposed users' names, emails, IP addresses, and locations, but CoinGecko's user accounts and passwords remained secure. CoinGecko is investigating the breach with GetResponse, informing affected users, and reviewing security procedures to enhance protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It’s recommended that users use caution when approaching emails about claim airdrops or tokens. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Crypto projects should be aware of the security controls used by the third-party vendors they are collaborating with.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://slowmist.medium.com/unraveling-how-a-malicious-extension-stole-a-million-dollars-e847a83cc50e\">\nSlowMist Reveals How a Malicious Aggr Chrome Extension Stole $1M+ in Crypto</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Aggr, marketed as a trading data aggregator, is a Chrome extension. In early June, a Binance user reported a loss of US$1 million in cryptocurrency, which was traced back to the Aggr plugin as the attack vector. SlowMist uncovered that Aggr harvested the cookies of traders utilizing the extension, specifically targeting cookies associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. With these cookies, the malicious actors behind Aggr were able to gain entry to Centralized Exchange (CEX) portals and take control of the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It's crucial for users to be vigilant when downloading any software onto their computers, including applications from browser stores. Researching the developers of extensions is an important step in ensuring safety. A simple review of their personal profile or recent track record should give you a good gauge of whether you can trust them. Developers who are anonymous or have no previous history available should be avoided in favor of those who are verified and reputable.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
