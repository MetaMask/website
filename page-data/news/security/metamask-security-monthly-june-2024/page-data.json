These researchers uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities before bad actors are able to exploit them. However, as the Security Alliance (SEAL) <a href=\"https://securityalliance.notion.site/Introducing-the-First-Legal-Defense-Fund-to-Support-Crypto-Whitehats-e6792614a5b34c9f9f3f529caf975750\">recently explained</a>, web2’s history shows that “this important work can sometimes lead to significant legal risks and subsequent costs, particularly when their research and disclosures are unwelcome or misunderstood.” Therefore, SEAL has launched an initiative with the Security Research Legal Defense Fund to provide legal resources to eligible researchers who use the <a href=\"https://github.com/security-alliance/safe-harbor\">Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement</a>.</p>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1804708942981091516\">User Loses $11M to Signature Phishing</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On June 22nd, a user signed multiple permit phishing signatures, which resulted in a loss of US$11 million worth of tokens. It was further revealed that the victim was a MakerDAO governance delegate. SEAL researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1795055077209579838\">Pcaversaccio believes signature phishing is the biggest problem in our industry</a>, stating users don’t care about the warnings and they consider the consequences of signing them. <a href=\"https://dune.com/tayvano/sha-zhu-pan\">MetaMask's @tayvano revealed a total estimate of $600M+ in damages from approval phishing scams since 2021.</a></p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users can protect themselves by following three primary steps. (1) Limit the assets of the wallet you browse daily with. If you sign a malicious signature, the impact will be minimized. (2) Validate the domain the signature request originates from and verify it matches the domain of the original project. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the project's official social media or blog page and check that the domains from these profiles match the request. (3) Validate the token and address contents of the request. The request will often involve a token you did not intend to send. The <code>spender</code> address and or the <code>to</code> address of the transactions will be different than the address you intended. These simple checks can save you from unintended fund loss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/299099/attacker-sends-nearly-24000-phishing-emails-derived-from-compromised-coingecko-third-party-email-platform\"><strong>23K Phishing Emails Sent After CoinGeko's 3rd-Party Email Service is Compromised</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, experienced a data breach on June 5 due to a compromised account at their third-party email marketing platform, GetResponse. An attacker accessed nearly 2 million contacts and sent 23,723 phishing emails from another client's account within GetResponse. The breach exposed users' names, emails, IP addresses, and locations, but CoinGecko's user accounts and passwords remained secure. CoinGecko is investigating the breach with GetResponse, informing affected users, and reviewing security procedures to enhance protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It’s recommended that users use caution when approaching emails about claim airdrops or tokens. Users should also avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Crypto projects should be aware of the security controls used by the third-party vendors they are collaborating with.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://slowmist.medium.com/unraveling-how-a-malicious-extension-stole-a-million-dollars-e847a83cc50e\">\nSlowMist Reveals How a Malicious Aggr Chrome Extension Stole $1M+ in Crypto</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Aggr, marketed as a trading data aggregator, is a Chrome extension. In early June, a Binance user reported a loss of US$1 million in cryptocurrency, which was traced back to the Aggr plugin as the attack vector. SlowMist uncovered that Aggr harvested the cookies of traders utilizing the extension, specifically targeting cookies associated with cryptocurrency exchanges. With these cookies, the malicious actors behind Aggr were able to gain entry to Centralized Exchange (CEX) portals and take control of the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It's crucial for users to be vigilant when downloading any software onto their computers, including applications from browser stores. Researching the developers of extensions is an important step in ensuring safety. A simple review of their personal profile or recent track record should give you a good gauge of whether you can trust them. Developers who are anonymous or have no previous history available should be avoided in favor of those who are verified and reputable.

This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful partnership.
