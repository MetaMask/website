In addition, he highlighted two impactful projects that MetaMask is working on: <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>, which extends the capabilities of MetaMask in a secure environment, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOTEJy_FqIA\">LavaMoat</a>, a tool that provides runtime protections within the JavaScript ecosystem to enhance security.</p>\n<p>Harry emphasized the importance of balancing security with functionality in smart contract design. Given the immutable nature of smart contracts, security should be prioritized, and any increase in functionality should be tested rigorously to prevent potential attack vectors. Gradually raising the limit of value locked within a new smart contract was suggested as a possible approach to enhance user protection.</p>\n<p>When asked about best practices for secure smart contract development, Harry suggested several key considerations, including prioritizing secure design principles, utilizing trusted libraries like OpenZeppelin, fostering a security-oriented mindset among developers, implementing comprehensive testing, and engaging professional code reviews. He stressed the importance of continuous education about common security risks and staying informed about the latest industry developments.</p>\n<p><strong>Herman Junge to Introduce Menpo at <a href=\"https://defisecuritysummit.org/\">DeFi Security Summit 2023</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🎙️ Speaker Announcement! 🎉<br><br>Join us at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFiSecuritySummit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DeFiSecuritySummit</a> to hear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bentobox19_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bentobox19_</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MetaMask</a> talk about<br><br>“Menpo - DeFi Incident Database”<br><br>Stay tuned for more updates on our lineup! 🌟<br><br>🌐 More info: <a href=\"https://t.co/y0e0t2SR5M\">https://t.co/y0e0t2SR5M</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AF9xM7UxY4\">pic.twitter.com/AF9xM7UxY4</a></p>&mdash; Defi Security Summit (@summit_defi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/summit_defi/status/1672179186117771264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>At the DeFi Security Summit in Paris on the 15th of July, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bentobox19_\">Herman Junge</a> will introduce Menpo, a project that utilizes <a href=\"https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html\">STIX 2.1</a> to standardize DeFi incidents. This initiative promotes the sharing of threat intelligence among security analysts and researchers. Such standardization allows for more efficient allocation of resources towards information security tasks and training initiatives.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this approach fosters the development of a cross-organizational threat intelligence entity, enabling the real-time sharing of incident reports as they unfold.

With Zbigniew Tenerowicz</a> for DevSecConf24</strong>\n&#x3C;br/ ></p>\n<p>In his talk, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naugtur\">Zbigniew Tenerowicz (ZB)</a> tackled the challenging question of whether to run or not  code from strangers. Despite the inherent risks, he acknowledged that it's a practice that's regularly undertaken in the tech world. He explored the realm of JavaScript projects, particularly examining how they can proactively safeguard themselves from supply chain attacks. This proactive defense was discussed under the assumption that a downloaded dependency has already shipped with a malicious dependency. ZB suggested methods such as restricting access to globals for each package and controlling a package's ability to access the network or file system.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he addressed the important issue of eradicating prototype pollution, a common vulnerability in JavaScript projects. ZB also turned his attention to future JavaScript features, particularly those currently under discussion in TC39. He demonstrated how these emerging features can be harnessed to protect projects in the present. To provide a more practical understanding, ZB offered an engaging live demonstration, showing how to execute actual malware safely, thus emphasizing the importance and effectiveness of the defensive measures discussed.</p>\n<p><strong>Gal Weizman on LavaMoat</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MetaMask 🦊 is an amazing app for many reasons.<br><br>One reason I like especially is that even though it works just fine, the window object of the app is (almost) unusable!<br><br>If you&#39;re into Browser JavaScript security, come learn about what we call &quot;scuttling&quot; - by LavaMoat 🌋<br><br>Well.. <a href=\"https://t.co/uJ8oLxVizH\">pic.twitter.com/uJ8oLxVizH</a></p>&mdash; Gal Weizman (@WeizmanGal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeizmanGal/status/1674751159003914240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 30, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/weizmangal\">Gal Weizman</a> writes about the unique security feature implemented by MetaMask called \"<a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/360\">scuttling</a>\" via a homegrown tool named LavaMoat. The tool is designed to protect against supply chain attacks, a serious concern due to the complex graph of dependencies that MetaMask runs on. LavaMoat achieves this by creating a separate sandbox for each dependency using Secure ECMAScript (SES) by Agoric. Each sandboxed dependency is only granted access to the specific features it needs, preventing unexpected access to sensitive features.</p>\n<p>However, there's a chance that a dependency might manage to escape its sandbox using allowed APIs and reach the window object, potentially negating LavaMoat's protection. To counter this, MetaMask uses Compartments, also implemented in SES, to ensure that API instances provided to the sandboxes aren't the original ones from the global object. Consequently, unused original APIs can be removed from the global object, enhancing security by denying escaped dependencies access to unauthorized APIs.</p>\n<p>This process of removing APIs and properties from the global object is termed \"scuttling.\" It effectively makes the window object unusable but doesn't affect the app's functionality. Though theoretically sound, the application is challenging in practice, with certain properties still not scuttled. The MetaMask team provides further resources on scuttling and LavaMoat for those interested.</p>\n<h3>Security Laboratory</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>LavaMoat Update</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More LavaMoat awareness: In addition to the DevSecConf24 above, a video on the same topic will be available July 5 from <a href=\"https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/i-run-code-from-the-internet\">React Summit 2023 on Git Nation</a>, also presented by Zbyszek.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a deep-dive into RN iOS native animation source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/docs/issues/9\">previous</a> investigation, the cause of assertion macros failing on parent and child nodes (thrown as exceptions executing the UI block) stems from failed WebView page loads upon navigation (also triggered by @babel/plugin-transform-runtime’s regenerator).

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 gaming players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ assets.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamers’ responsibility of security their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask is continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently.
