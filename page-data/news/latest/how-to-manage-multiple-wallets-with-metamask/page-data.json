But if you’ve been around a while, you may be juggling several different Secret Recovery Phrases. That can get complicated, but there are ways to make it easier from a usage perspective. Let’s take a dive into how to manage multiple wallets without losing your mind.</p>\n<h4>But why?</h4>\n<p>Why would you want, or need, multiple <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107-User-Guide-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-password-and-private-keys\">Secret Recovery Phrases</a>? After all, each SRP can generate a near-infinite number of accounts, so you can just organize your tokens and assets at the account level, right?<br><br>Well, there are actually a lot of potential use cases and avantages. First of all, if your SRP becomes somehow compromised, <em>all</em> the accounts generated using that SRP are compromised. Some users who are interested in engaging with cutting-edge, unproven dapps and platforms prefer to have their riskier behavior ‘sandboxed’ in a separate wallet.</p>\n<p>Another reason to employ multiple SRPs is so that you can have a ‘public’ identity as well as more anonymous identities; if you want to try out a platform without associating it publicly through on-chain data with your publicly-known identity, an alternate SRP is a straightforward way to do it.</p>\n<p>Another common scenario is that of entrepreneurs or businesspeople; they may have personal wallets and business wallets. It is, of course, good business practice to keep these separate. However, there’s a practical side to it as well: if you need to report your crypto holdings to tax agencies, it’s much more convenient to have a separate SRP for each taxable entity.</p>\n<p>Last but not least: some people have several different <em>versions</em> of MetaMask installed at the same time. A developer may be working with a custom build they’ve created themselves, or making beautiful new functionality for MetaMask in our developers' distribution, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/flask/\">Flask</a>. An institutional investor may be working with our enterprise-tailored <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a>, perhaps with several different wallets. Developers often have SRPs specifically for development, which they use to deploy smart contracts. Under these circumstances, you have to be very careful to have <strong>only one version of MetaMask active in the same browser at the same time, or it won’t work.</strong></p>\n<p>These are some of the most common scenarios, and this list is by no means exhaustive. So enough about the why; how do these crypto-connoisseurs manage it all?</p>\n<h4>Secret Recovery Phrase hygiene and safety</h4>\n<p>The first step to managing <em>any</em> Web3 identity is to practice good SRP hygiene and safety. This is what we mean:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>“Not your keys, not your coins”</strong>: the old Bitcoin maxim holds true on other blockchains, as well. <strong>Never, ever, <em>ever</em> share your Secret Recovery Phrase</strong>. Anyone who has that phrase has complete and irrevocable control over the accounts generated with it. Never share it–<em>especially</em> if they say they’re trying to help.</li><li><strong>Secure backups</strong>: If those twelve words represent total control over your accounts, how do you keep them safe <em>and</em> accessible at the same time? <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432\">We’ve got a whole article on SRP security</a>, but these points bear repeating:&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DO:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Write down your Secret Recovery Phrase somewhere safe</li><li>Double-check your spelling and that you wrote down every word in the same order they were given</li><li>Reach out to MetaMask Support's <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058230211\">official channels</a> if you need help</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DON’T:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keep it in an easily discovered location; e.g. in a cloud-saved document or email titled \"Seed Phrase\"; on a post-it note stuck to your computer.</li><li>Provide your seed phrase to anyone, even if they say they're from MetaMask Support</li><li>Change the order of the words</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Consider getting a hardware wallet</strong>. This adds a layer of complexity to your SRP management, so if you’re thinking about it, read our <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5450173968283-User-Guide-How-to-use-a-Hardware-Wallet\">hardware wallet configuration recommendations here</a>.</li><li>Lastly: if a sidechain (like <a href=\"https://wallet.roninchain.com/\">Ronin</a>, for example) requires you to set up a new wallet, consider whether you want to re-use an existing SRP, or generate a new one. Pro tip: it would be safer to generate a new one.</li></ul>\n<p>Follow these guidelines, and you’re well on your way to staying safe in Web3.</p>\n<p><strong>So without further ado: <em>how do I hold all these SRPs??</em></strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\" style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ikEw3xRrslLKhcTQyM_T4Z8nSO7lYgvKPDFUcEuICnLhXoH9MIvq0Jiybe7R3dH6_OVRVFEa9frE_UvQD--M0BFwpuStw8h2CqHNdhGulwGwsAEnfnEcpMKDBm4LWN2Z3CmNcAEh4_CwlQi9Mw\" alt=\"Juggling multiple wallets and Secret Recover Phrases\"/></a><figcaption><em>So many <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\">BIP-39</a> compliant words</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are two main ways to do it: use different browsers, or set up different <em>browser profiles</em>. Don’t worry, it’s fairly easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Using different browsers</strong></p>\n<p>This option is as straightforward as it sounds: if you’ve only got two or three SRPs, then <strong>you can simply install MetaMask in several different browsers, and use a different browser for each one.</strong> Given the open-source nature of the modern web, there’s not a definitive listing of browsers that it will or won’t work in. The browsers officially supported by MetaMask at press time are Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Using browser profiles</strong></p>\n<p>The easiest way to manage multiple wallets is by using <strong>browser profiles</strong>.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
