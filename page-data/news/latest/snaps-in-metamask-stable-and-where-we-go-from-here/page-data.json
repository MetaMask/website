This has been the culmination of years of hard work and original research by a fabulous team, and I’m excited to tell you what it’s about, how it came about, and where it’s headed.</p>\n<p>I believe <a href=\"https://medium.com/metamask/introducing-the-next-evolution-of-the-web3-wallet-4abdf801a4ee\">the original Snaps thesis</a> continues to be accurate. Snaps are a good idea for the same reason that Ethereum is a good idea, for the same reason that computing is a good idea: <strong>General purpose thinking tools are awesome.</strong></p>\n<p>All this time we’ve been trying to build an interface to Ethereum, a turing-complete computer, but our interface was being written by a single team! It is obvious that the ideal wallet for an open-ended machine like Ethereum would need to be as flexible as it is, and today marks an important step towards making it so.</p>\n<p><strong>MetaMask Snaps is a new system in the wallet that allows the user to opt into additional enhancements to their wallet at runtime.</strong> We’re launching with a set of APIs and partners using them that enable our wallet to suddenly support new blockchains, new transaction security providers, and a variety of notification systems (including a chat Snap!). We think these will offer a lot of new possibilities in terms of scalability and safety, but this is really just the beginning.</p>\n<h3>The Snaps Story: How Did We Get Here?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>The most important part of the Snaps story to me is that we now have a system at the heart of our wallet that allows us to step back and humbly invite the community to provide their own solutions to the hardest problems. I have some big ideas and opinions about what the future of transaction safety could look like, but that’s no reason for it to be the only idea being validated. We’re helping usher in a new paradigm of distributed computing, and there are a lot of questions that need creative solutions, and so I still believe that lowering the barrier and cost to trying new things can be an important accelerant to finding good answers to those hard problems. This isn’t about accelerating technology for its own sake, it’s about accelerating the process of finding improvements in the ways we do things.</p>\n<p>Through this process, I’ve <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4A01rYb5Fpg?si=LcnoOg3iNOsEpELH\">reflected</a> that long term, I expect more software to be open-ended and easily extended and interconnected. A secure extensibility system should be a very solved problem, and frankly I think it should be the default for how software is built and written, and I expect it will be in the long term. Since safely extensible software isn’t a cheap commodity yet, I’m deeply proud of our team for helping carve a path towards making a more collaborative future for computing in general.</p>\n<p>Our journey to Snaps took us through some exciting corners in the history of computing, and allowed us to make some wonderful friends. There is no over-stating the value of our partnership with <a href=\"https://agoric.com/\">Agoric</a> in this endeavor, who designed a JavaScript confinement API, has <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ses\">proposed it to the JS standards committee TC-39</a>, implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses\">a working shim</a> of that API that can be used today, and collaborated with us in refining this system, <a href=\"https://github.com/lavamoat/lavamoat\">LavaMoat</a>, and our approach to secure computing generally. Our Snaps system leverages the Agoric Compartment shim, additionally confined within an iframe. You can watch me have a conversation with Mark Miller, Chief Scientist at Agoric <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPGnJf3e9DA\">here</a>. You can read our purple team audit of the Compartment shim <a href=\"https://agoric.com/blog/technology/purple-teaming-how-metamask-and-agoric-hunted-bugs-to-harden-javascript\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We engaged in this journey through a particularly challenging time for a WebExtension: Google itself proposed a major overhaul for how extensions like MetaMask could work, and for a moment it loomed over the entire project as a possible death blow (or at least a change that forced us to move off the extension platform). Fortunately, thanks in large part to astonishingly smart and considerate bizdev people at both Consensys and Google, we were able to come up with compromises in the way the extension platform was changing that allowed MetaMask's ambitious goals without compromising on either company’s security ideals.</p>\n<p>Those changes still required enormous contributions from around Consensys to help us navigate. It’s one thing to drive a major initiative through a heavily-used security-critical product like MetaMask, but even more to do it while also migrating the entire codebase to what was essentially a new platform. This feat is a testament to multiple teams at MetaMask working closely together to share the burden, so we would unlock the much more exciting work on the other side, and I’m deeply grateful for all of them.</p>\n<p>The Snaps system includes some of the most beautiful design contributions the MetaMask wallet has ever been blessed with (with some related design changes coming to more of the wallet soon!). The process of a site proposing a Snap to the user, the user securely reviewing the risks involved, and the extensible user interface system we’ve made available to Snaps for confirmations (which is only getting better) is the product of incredibly deep secure design conversations, user research, and plenty of sparks of inspiration. We’ve created a world class permission system here, and we’re continuing to drive it in more exciting directions.</p>\n<p>Coming soon, some of my favorite APIs we have planned are new account types (hello 4337), Snap-defined assets (Snap assets don’t show up in the main token list… yet), and home screen widgets, which will leverage the extensible UI framework we’re building, which you can first experience in the custom confirmations that Snaps can show today.</p>\n<p>We’ve got a page of Snaps that have been fully audited and are <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/index.html?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=website&#x26;utm_campaign=snaps_open_beta_announcement\">ready to play with</a> today, and I recommend you try that out. Long term, I expect some of the most fun Snaps to be things that shatter our previous conceptions of what the system was good for. I’d like to make a nod to Archis for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Arch_0125/status/1680207959392161793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1680207959392161793%7Ctwgr%5E0c31ac8658f97805c6c2b8834bff64d29ed646e6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&#x26;ref_url=https://roamresearch.com//app/capabul\">making a Snap demo that uses an LLM to instruct the wallet to perform a trade</a>. With the AI boom, it really couldn’t be a better time to be cracking the wallet open for mad science.</p>\n<h3>A New Chapter: Discovering The Best Internet</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Having a system for managing safe extensibility is really a new beginning. The APIs we launch with today could each enable a Snap that multiplies the usefulness of MetaMask, but maybe even more importantly is the fact that with this foundation, we can increasingly look at any part of the wallet that we think users deserve more control over, or that developers have more creativity to offer for, and we can open up an API method and let the creativity in to sweep the product in new directions. <strong>This isn’t just a feature release, this is the product taking a dramatically more externally collaborative posture.</strong> One of my greatest pains helping craft MetaMask over my nearly eight years here has been being constantly aware of the ocean of creativity that was just out of our backlog’s reach because of our regular obligation to the essentials of safety and compatibility. Snaps is a humble admission that we can’t do this all alone. The journey of discovering the best internet will take many creative contributions. On top of that, we couldn’t ship my ideas as fast as I had them, either! Snaps is covertly a selfish feature: You will now be able to extend the most popular wallet with less bureaucracy than a founder of the world’s most popular wallet could last week.</p>\n<p>I think it’s important to acknowledge one major limitation of the current Snaps system. Today it cannot be fully permissionlessly extended. The Snaps that can be installed are ones that we approved because we confirmed they were audited, in addition to being confined in all the ways the installation prompt says. This was made both out of an abundance of caution, and because we have ideas for how to add additional safety for a permissionless version that will take longer to implement, but we wanted to get something out the door sooner (it’s already been so long).</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, the long game is permissionless computing. One of the inciting events in my web3 journey was having <a href=\"https://fartomin.wordpress.com/\">a good app rejected</a> by Apple for arbitrary reasons. Today it seems like computers are either safe walled gardens or totally insecure but permissionless, and I believe we’ve built foundations for carving a space that is neither of those things, and our sights are set on that space in between. Safe, user-custodial computing is on its way, and we invite you to help us define it.</p>\n<p>If you’re a developer wanting to experiment with this platform, I have to recommend installing <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">Flask</a>, our developer-centric distribution of MetaMask. With it you can install any Snap (even one we haven’t audited), and start building your own.</p>\n<p>Anyways, this is a great moment to celebrate, because we are multiplying the number of features MetaMask has today, but the funny part is that the most exciting stuff is doubtlessly the parts that have yet to be built on it.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, MoonPay.</strong></p>\n<p>MoonPay is a leading crypto company that lets users buy and sell digital assets directly with their MetaMask wallet. Since MoonPay’s partnership with MetaMask began in 2022, we’ve been dedicated to simplifying the management of cryptocurrencies, while keeping users secure. Let’s dive into the ways our collaboration achieves this.</p>\n<h2>Streamlining DeFi onboarding</h2>\n<p>As the demand for self-custodial wallets has risen, so too has the need for robust and intuitive tools that give users a frictionless “web2-like” experience. In the past, the two haven’t always mixed well. Newcomers to crypto, who typically have the highest appetite for intuitive UX, tend to find DeFi overly complex.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this tension, MoonPay saw an opportunity to bridge-the-gap by providing seamless cash-to-crypto onboarding to the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, MetaMask. Integrating with MoonPay allowed MetaMask’s millions of users to interface with DeFi through familiar payment options like credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. It also allowed MetaMask users to benefit from MoonPay’s stringent security protocols.</p>\n<h2>Simplifying ramps to protect users</h2>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the integration is that users can purchase digital assets directly within MetaMask wallet — eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms. This approach smoothes out the process, while keeping users’ information safe. By avoiding unnecessary third-party platforms, data exposure is minimized.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing exposure by helping users stay within the platform, MoonPay is committed to protection and security in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ramps are built with advanced encryption technology like AES-256.</li>\n<li>We comply with PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 standards, ensuring we meet stringent data security criteria.</li>\n<li>Our systems have undergone independent audits for PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001/27018, and SOC2 Type 2 certifications, giving users peace of mind that our safety standards don’t waver.</li>\n<li>Our rigorous Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies helps prevent bad actors from entering our ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating a more secure web3</h2>\n<p>As we continue to work alongside MetaMask, our shared focus on safe, user-friendly solutions remains a cornerstone of this partnership. Together, we’re not only simplifying crypto onboarding for newcomers – we’re setting the bar for what it means to prioritize security in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and selling crypto with your MetaMask wallet via MoonPay has never been easier.
