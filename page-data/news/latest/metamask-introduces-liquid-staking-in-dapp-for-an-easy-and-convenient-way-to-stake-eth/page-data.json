You can stake and view your rewards directly in the dapp without having to leave.</p>\n<h3>What is Staking?</h3>\n<p>In the context of Ethereum, staking is the act of securing the network by “depositing” or “locking up” your tokens into a smart contract and receiving rewards in return. This is typically done in 3 ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Liquid staking</li>\n<li>Solo staking</li>\n<li>Custodial staking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MetaMask Staking allows you to engage in liquid staking with two prominent providers, Lido and Rocket Pool, whereby you can deposit your ETH and receive a token representing the value of your stake in return. While the end result of liquidity staking is basically the same, how it works (the token issued in exchange for staking your assets) differs across providers.</p>\n<p>Lido issues stETH in exchange for ETH; Rocket Pool issues rETH in exchange for ETH.</p>\n<p>Lido’s stETH is a rebasing token that accrues rewards by increasing the amount of stETH owned over time; Rocket Pool’s rETH is a repricing token that accrues rewards by increasing the amount of ETH that rETH is redeemable for.</p>\n<p>Users either choose to hold on to this stETH/rETH token for when they would like to withdraw their stake (not currently available until future network upgrades), use it as collateral in DeFi, or even <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">swap</a> it for another token (back to ETH or another ERC20).</p>\n<p>Note: <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake\">MetaMask Staking</a> provides the interface to connect with Lido and Rocket Pool smart contracts directly—we don’t provide the staking service ourselves.</p>\n<h3>How to Stake</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit portfolio.metamask.io</li>\n<li>Toggle to the staking tab to choose your desired staking provider and click \"Stake\"</li>\n<li>Enter the amount you want to stake and click \"Review\"</li>\n<li>Review your stake and click \"Confirm\"</li>\n<li>Sign the transaction in your wallet</li>\n<li>When your transaction is complete, click \"View holdings\"</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Securing the network and receiving rewards</h3>\n<p>In this post-Merge world, there is a growing demand for simple staking services that will ultimately secure Ethereum. Whether you’re a seasoned staker or a sideline watcher, MetaMask Staking offers an intuitive way to jump in and stake your ETH for rewards.</p>\n<p>What better way to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake\">try it out</a> than with your favorite self-custodial wallet?</p>\n<p>Happy staking!</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive our Newsletter","description":null,"portalId":"4795067","formId":"fbfea1e4-e214-4ab2-a98b-964f9a81695a","campaignId":null,"displayTitle":true,"width":null,"customClass":"newsletterOnNewsDetail","customId":null},"latest":{"internal":{"type":"ContentfulLayoutModuleContainer"},"contentful_id":"nO1tqQRjoUDUJfdg2B651","node_locale":"en-US","eyebrow":null,"headline":"Keep reading our latest stories","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Developers, security news, and more</p>"}},"modules":[{"node_locale":"en-US","contentful_id":"6iOGB8Fiab9ilS0jfZ8N5I","fontSize":null,"ctaLink":"/news/","displayText":"All posts","displayTextTreatment":null,"newTab":false,"buttonDisplay":false,"buttonGradient":false,"buttonSecondary":false,"hideButtonIcon":null,"eventLabel":null,"eventCategory":null,"socialLink":null,"showCaretRight":null,"buttonCaretDown":null,"launchDarklyFlag":null,"customClassName":null,"internal":{"type":"ContentfulCta"},"hubSpotForm":null,"embedHTML":null,"downloadBrowsers":null,"mobileCta":null,"alternativeCta":null},{"contentful_id":"1B0wZMveBTSiMJZWu4uunI","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulModuleContainer"},"title":"News > Latest Stories (3 items)","description":null,"numberOfItem":3,"columns":3,"columnType":null,"columnsOnTablet":null,"centerOnTablet":null,"columnsOnMobile":1,"centerOnMobile":null,"contentAlignment":"left","splitModules":false,"displayTitle":false,"isLiquiditySection":false,"isTrustBar":null,"gridModulesGap":"12px","loadMoreMode":null,"loadMoreCta":null,"carouselMode":null,"hasRegionSelector":null,"regionSelectorHeadline":null,"regionSelectorPopupTitle":null,"regionSelectorPopupText":null,"regionListKey":null,"extraData":null,"modules":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}]}],"cta":null,"backgroundColor":"default","displayHeadline":true,"headlineAlignCenter":true,"contentAlignCenter":false,"headlineMarginTop0":null,"paddingTop":"40px","sectionPadding":null,"noPaddingTop":null,"noPaddingBottom":false,"modulesMargin":null,"isTab":false,"moduleId":null,"customClass":"storiesOnNewsDetail","sideImage":null,"backgroundSize":"cover","backgroundImage":null},"latestStories":{"nodes":[{"contentful_id":"4uNWsEJpmKwVHI5EaNYsAQ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"More With MetaMask: Mendi Finance Snap","slug":"more-with-metamask-partner-series-mendi-finance","subtitle":"The More With MetaMask Partner Series explores builders who are transforming web3.

Amongst these is the threat of liquidation due to a lack of funds.</p>\n<p>Users’ funds can be liquidated if their collateral is no longer sufficient to cover their loan. In the last 30 days, <a href=\"https://dune.com/dsalv/Liquidations\">over $27 million was liquidated</a> from the top 3 lending protocols alone. MetaMask has teamed up with Mendi Finance to empower users to avoid liquidation, and efficiently keep track of their financial limits.</p>\n<p>Together, MetaMask and Mendi have created the first DeFi Snap on Linea—the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/mendi-finance/alert-snap/\">Mendi Finance Liquidation alert</a>—allowing users to lend and borrow with peace of mind. Users can manually set a borrow limit that they consider unhealthy.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
