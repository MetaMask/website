We had the pleasure of interviewing some of the creators in attendance: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel</a>. It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need.

Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful partnership. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks, or buy crypto with fiat. The future of gaming is now.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave outdated gaming platforms behind and immerse yourself in web3 gaming by exploring <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/downloads\">HyperPlay</a> today.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Find out how MetaMask and HyperPlay are ushering in a new era of web3 gaming that is secure and powerful.
