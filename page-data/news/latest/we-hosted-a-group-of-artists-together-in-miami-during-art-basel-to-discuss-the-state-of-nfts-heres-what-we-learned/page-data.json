We had the pleasure of interviewing some of the creators in attendance: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel</a>. It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.
