Instead of bringing a dish to share, each artist came to the table with an NFT gift for one another. NFTs were minted on <a href=\"https://manifold.xyz/\">Manifold</a>. By the end of the night, every artist left with a unique piece of art they could <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?tab=nfts?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=event-recap-miami_content\">view</a> in their MetaMask account, just in time for the giving season.

We even had a designer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taramoves\">Tara Moves</a>, sketch the event in real-time:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/01615Y7gvbFGyGgJiG7EV0/6b0bb54123b7ca42665e5ecb8adfa275/tara_live_sketch.png?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"tara live sketch\"></p>\n<h3>Chatting with the artists</h3>\n<p>We could rave on about the night but you don’t have to take our word for it. We had the pleasure of interviewing some of the creators in attendance: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel</a>. It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need. I don’t need to be run by a bank. I own my keys. I love [MetaMask] security and communication.”</p>\n<p>A strong preference for self-custody is a sentiment we feel will be adopted by more people. This is the silver lining during the recent insolvency of big CeFi players: more people are asking important questions and taking a closer look at the security of their assets to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>Where does one start with their self-custody journey? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1590121718009380867\">Education</a>. Whether you’re an artist, DeFi dabbler, or tech veteran—you can download MetaMask, the wallet that gives you the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=event-recap-miami_content\">freedom to exit</a> anytime, for any reason.</p>\n<p>We closed our conversations out on a fun note, asking each artist to describe the future of NFTs in three words:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7vjwSRJmknuLCpNEQZ1Zr4/4f8fd1ef6025bfe6605c3df6f424ba33/frases.gif?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"3 words only \"></p>\n<p>MetaMask’s inaugural Artist Potluck in Miami hearkened back to ages of old when brilliant minds would come together over dinner and drinks, and talk about their art and what inspires them.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 gaming players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ assets.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. MetaMask offers Yooldo gamers the tools they need to protect against digital threats of every kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to begin your web3 gaming journey.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.
