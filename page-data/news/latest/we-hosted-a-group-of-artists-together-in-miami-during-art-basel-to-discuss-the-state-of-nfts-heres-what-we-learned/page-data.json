Instead of bringing a dish to share, each artist came to the table with an NFT gift for one another. NFTs were minted on <a href=\"https://manifold.xyz/\">Manifold</a>. By the end of the night, every artist left with a unique piece of art they could <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?tab=nfts?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=event-recap-miami_content\">view</a> in their MetaMask account, just in time for the giving season.

We even had a designer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taramoves\">Tara Moves</a>, sketch the event in real-time:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/01615Y7gvbFGyGgJiG7EV0/6b0bb54123b7ca42665e5ecb8adfa275/tara_live_sketch.png?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"tara live sketch\"></p>\n<h3>Chatting with the artists</h3>\n<p>We could rave on about the night but you don’t have to take our word for it. We had the pleasure of interviewing some of the creators in attendance: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel</a>. It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need. I don’t need to be run by a bank. I own my keys. I love [MetaMask] security and communication.”</p>\n<p>A strong preference for self-custody is a sentiment we feel will be adopted by more people. This is the silver lining during the recent insolvency of big CeFi players: more people are asking important questions and taking a closer look at the security of their assets to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>Where does one start with their self-custody journey? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1590121718009380867\">Education</a>. Whether you’re an artist, DeFi dabbler, or tech veteran—you can download MetaMask, the wallet that gives you the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=event-recap-miami_content\">freedom to exit</a> anytime, for any reason.</p>\n<p>We closed our conversations out on a fun note, asking each artist to describe the future of NFTs in three words:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7vjwSRJmknuLCpNEQZ1Zr4/4f8fd1ef6025bfe6605c3df6f424ba33/frases.gif?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"3 words only \"></p>\n<p>MetaMask’s inaugural Artist Potluck in Miami hearkened back to ages of old when brilliant minds would come together over dinner and drinks, and talk about their art and what inspires them.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<p>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<p>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<p>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<p>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.\nKey Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
