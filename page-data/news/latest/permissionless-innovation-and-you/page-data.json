(A/B testing is a common practice in modern software development, where the developer gives some users experience A, the rest experience B, and then compares their performance.) When we are A/B tested, we don’t know how many experiences are being tested at once, why we are being tested, or how long the test will last. In my case, the experience was that the app’s home page started automatically playing music, much like a hideous website of the Dotcom-era internet. Whenever this happened, my first instinct was to launch my phone into the nearest wall, but I settled for hastily changing to a different view.</p>\n<h3>“We have obtained a bicycle for the mind only to confine it to a shopping mall.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>There was nothing I could have done to prevent this from happening short of not using the app. The developer is a multi-billion dollar corporation with hundreds of millions of users; even if I managed to get a hold of them, my opinion would be no more than a row in a spreadsheet. I have probably been A/B tested many times since then, but I know it happened at least once: a few days ago, a friend was in a different testing cohort than me, and had a feature on their home page that I wanted for myself. Maybe I’ll get it someday, maybe I won’t; either way I’m powerless to affect the outcome.</p>\n<p>I believe that this experience reflects something essential about being a user of today’s internet, and of computers generally. Products and services we depend on every day change constantly and without our consent, sometimes to our liking, others to our annoyance, and often to our indifference. We have a choice, sure, but only between this or that walled garden, never between less or more agency. Despite that our digital devices are infinitely expressive and under our direct physical control, the experience of using them is almost completely at the mercy of forces greater than ourselves. In other words, our agency as users is extremely limited. The causes of this are both political and economical in nature, but it is also the legacy of Steve Jobs and “end-to-end control”. We have obtained a bicycle for the mind only to confine it to a shopping mall.</p>\n<h3>“To create something better than web2 and safely increase user agency, we need both compelling economic incentives and the technical means to do it.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>How can we as users reclaim some of our agency? The fact is that our options are limited, and from a commercial app developer’s perspective, user agency is usually at odds with your business objectives and/or the safety of your users. Web2 did not supplant the Dotcom internet for no reason, and A/B testing is a common practice precisely because it has proven to be effective. Ultimately, web2 delivers on many of its promises, such as instant commerce and communication, as opposed to the Dotcom internet, which promised everything and delivered little. To create something better than web2 and safely increase user agency, we need both compelling economic incentives and the technical means to do it. This finally brings us to web3 and wallets.</p>\n<p>A wallet is a software application that helps a person manage their web3 “stuff” (accounts, assets, transactions, etc.) and safely do things with it (e.g. sending transactions or granting allowances). At MetaMask we call this “exercising your digital authority.” The problem is that developers have built an astonishing variety of stuff using web3, which has in turn exploded the kinds and ways of digital authority that people want to exercise.</p>\n<p>Ethereum alone encompasses ERC-20s, NFTs, DAOs, Mainnet, L2s, bridges, onramps, offramps and a slew of other primitives composing its current ecosystem. That doesn’t even begin to encompass things like ERC-4337, which despite being analogous to Ethereum’s existing transaction model will have profound implications at the UX layer. And then of course, people don’t want to use just Ethereum, but also other L1s like Cosmos, Solana, and Avalanche. This has created a fragmented user experience across web3 that compromises user safety. When users are required to navigate multiple interfaces, it increases the risk of mistakes and makes them more vulnerable to malicious actors.</p>\n<h3>“...the solution is more developer and user agency, not less.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>The solution is, naturally, to <strong>create a universal web3 interface</strong>. But how can this be achieved? If a single organization were to unilaterally create such an interface, it would just replicate the incentive structure and results of web2 applications. We believe that it is, fortunately, impossible for this to occur for the foreseeable future; even if it could, no corporation would develop the expertise necessary to enable people to safely exercise their digital authority across such a wide range of domains.</p>\n<p>Instead of repeating the mistakes of web2, wallets need to take a lesson from web browsers and become vehicles for the ambitions of our communities. Rather than attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all solution, we must create an environment where developers have the freedom to innovate and cater to the specific needs and preferences of their users. In other words, the solution is more developer and user agency, not less.</p>\n<h3>“<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io\">MetaMask Snaps</a>… is an extensibility system for MetaMask that enables anyone to extend the functionality of the wallet, at runtime, without our permission.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/decentralizing-the-wallet-experience-with-metamask-snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>. Snaps is an extensibility system for MetaMask that enables anyone to extend the functionality of the wallet, at runtime, without our permission. In the initial version of the system, we are curating the list of available Snaps. In the future, anyone will be able to create and publish a Snap, and anyone will be able to install it. Snaps is the means by which MetaMask will become a universal web3 interface, all while granting all MetaMask users far greater control over their wallets. We are able to do this by means of cutting-edge JavaScript developed with our partners at <a href=\"https://agoric.com/\">Agoric</a>. You can learn more about the story of Snaps in <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/snaps-in-metamask-stable-and-where-we-go-from-here/\">this post by Dan Finlay</a>.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the essence of what we call permissionless innovation (PI). Generally speaking, PI refers to the ability of developers and users to create decentralized applications without the approval of centralized actors. <strong>Its purpose is to give people more control over their digital lives.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> is a concrete instantiation of a PI strategy that combines the economic incentives with the technical means to safely expand the agency of all MetaMask users. We hope that the release of MetaMask Snaps marks the beginning of an era of safely extensible computing, where people rather than platforms will own their data and social networks.</p>\n<p>We have much more to share about the road to making MetaMask Snaps fully permissionless, and are excited to invite you on this journey of co-creating the wallet with you. Together we can break out of the shopping mall that has been erected around us, and venture into the unexplored territory that lies beyond.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive

was overshadowed by platforms that censored players and game developers from being able to use their crypto assets within games. We set out to build a secure, censorship-resistant, free-market gaming platform that not only offered greater flexibility and ownership than the web2 paradigm, but also provided a more accessible cross-platform experience. Today, we are entering a new era of gaming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/15BcZsL1lavnanKVEvyfz3/14eb170ac038e038d21f4438dfb14dcf/image1.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay MetaMask onboarding screen\"></p>\n<h2>Replacing the old formula</h2>\n<p>While the web2 gaming world continues to cling to its old ways, <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay’s</a> web3-friendly game store allows players to carry their in-game assets across all games, offering them <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/@hyperplay/game-asset-ownership-matters-%E2%80%94-heres-why\">true ownership</a> and autonomy, without fear of de-platforming.<a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet</a> is a key tool in this effort, eliminating obstacles for gamers and developers alike.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/how-hyperplay-is-building-a-web3-game-store-with-the-metamask-developer/\">game store</a> brings token swaps, cross-chain bridging, and easy cash to crypto on-ramping into every game through our in-game overlay. This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful combination. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks or buy crypto with fiat.
