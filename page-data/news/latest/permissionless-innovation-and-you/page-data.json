(A/B testing is a common practice in modern software development, where the developer gives some users experience A, the rest experience B, and then compares their performance.) When we are A/B tested, we don’t know how many experiences are being tested at once, why we are being tested, or how long the test will last. In my case, the experience was that the app’s home page started automatically playing music, much like a hideous website of the Dotcom-era internet. Whenever this happened, my first instinct was to launch my phone into the nearest wall, but I settled for hastily changing to a different view.</p>\n<h3>“We have obtained a bicycle for the mind only to confine it to a shopping mall.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>There was nothing I could have done to prevent this from happening short of not using the app. The developer is a multi-billion dollar corporation with hundreds of millions of users; even if I managed to get a hold of them, my opinion would be no more than a row in a spreadsheet. I have probably been A/B tested many times since then, but I know it happened at least once: a few days ago, a friend was in a different testing cohort than me, and had a feature on their home page that I wanted for myself. Maybe I’ll get it someday, maybe I won’t; either way I’m powerless to affect the outcome.</p>\n<p>I believe that this experience reflects something essential about being a user of today’s internet, and of computers generally. Products and services we depend on every day change constantly and without our consent, sometimes to our liking, others to our annoyance, and often to our indifference. We have a choice, sure, but only between this or that walled garden, never between less or more agency. Despite that our digital devices are infinitely expressive and under our direct physical control, the experience of using them is almost completely at the mercy of forces greater than ourselves. In other words, our agency as users is extremely limited. The causes of this are both political and economical in nature, but it is also the legacy of Steve Jobs and “end-to-end control”. We have obtained a bicycle for the mind only to confine it to a shopping mall.</p>\n<h3>“To create something better than web2 and safely increase user agency, we need both compelling economic incentives and the technical means to do it.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>How can we as users reclaim some of our agency? The fact is that our options are limited, and from a commercial app developer’s perspective, user agency is usually at odds with your business objectives and/or the safety of your users. Web2 did not supplant the Dotcom internet for no reason, and A/B testing is a common practice precisely because it has proven to be effective. Ultimately, web2 delivers on many of its promises, such as instant commerce and communication, as opposed to the Dotcom internet, which promised everything and delivered little. To create something better than web2 and safely increase user agency, we need both compelling economic incentives and the technical means to do it. This finally brings us to web3 and wallets.</p>\n<p>A wallet is a software application that helps a person manage their web3 “stuff” (accounts, assets, transactions, etc.) and safely do things with it (e.g. sending transactions or granting allowances). At MetaMask we call this “exercising your digital authority.” The problem is that developers have built an astonishing variety of stuff using web3, which has in turn exploded the kinds and ways of digital authority that people want to exercise.</p>\n<p>Ethereum alone encompasses ERC-20s, NFTs, DAOs, Mainnet, L2s, bridges, onramps, offramps and a slew of other primitives composing its current ecosystem. That doesn’t even begin to encompass things like ERC-4337, which despite being analogous to Ethereum’s existing transaction model will have profound implications at the UX layer. And then of course, people don’t want to use just Ethereum, but also other L1s like Cosmos, Solana, and Avalanche. This has created a fragmented user experience across web3 that compromises user safety. When users are required to navigate multiple interfaces, it increases the risk of mistakes and makes them more vulnerable to malicious actors.</p>\n<h3>“...the solution is more developer and user agency, not less.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>The solution is, naturally, to <strong>create a universal web3 interface</strong>. But how can this be achieved? If a single organization were to unilaterally create such an interface, it would just replicate the incentive structure and results of web2 applications. We believe that it is, fortunately, impossible for this to occur for the foreseeable future; even if it could, no corporation would develop the expertise necessary to enable people to safely exercise their digital authority across such a wide range of domains.</p>\n<p>Instead of repeating the mistakes of web2, wallets need to take a lesson from web browsers and become vehicles for the ambitions of our communities. Rather than attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all solution, we must create an environment where developers have the freedom to innovate and cater to the specific needs and preferences of their users. In other words, the solution is more developer and user agency, not less.</p>\n<h3>“<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io\">MetaMask Snaps</a>… is an extensibility system for MetaMask that enables anyone to extend the functionality of the wallet, at runtime, without our permission.”</h3>\n<br/> \n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/decentralizing-the-wallet-experience-with-metamask-snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a>. Snaps is an extensibility system for MetaMask that enables anyone to extend the functionality of the wallet, at runtime, without our permission. In the initial version of the system, we are curating the list of available Snaps. In the future, anyone will be able to create and publish a Snap, and anyone will be able to install it. Snaps is the means by which MetaMask will become a universal web3 interface, all while granting all MetaMask users far greater control over their wallets. We are able to do this by means of cutting-edge JavaScript developed with our partners at <a href=\"https://agoric.com/\">Agoric</a>. You can learn more about the story of Snaps in <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/snaps-in-metamask-stable-and-where-we-go-from-here/\">this post by Dan Finlay</a>.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps is the essence of what we call permissionless innovation (PI). Generally speaking, PI refers to the ability of developers and users to create decentralized applications without the approval of centralized actors. <strong>Its purpose is to give people more control over their digital lives.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> is a concrete instantiation of a PI strategy that combines the economic incentives with the technical means to safely expand the agency of all MetaMask users.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, MoonPay.</strong></p>\n<p>MoonPay is a leading crypto company that lets users buy and sell digital assets directly with their MetaMask wallet. Since MoonPay’s partnership with MetaMask began in 2022, we’ve been dedicated to simplifying the management of cryptocurrencies, while keeping users secure. Let’s dive into the ways our collaboration achieves this.</p>\n<h2>Streamlining DeFi onboarding</h2>\n<p>As the demand for self-custodial wallets has risen, so too has the need for robust and intuitive tools that give users a frictionless “web2-like” experience. In the past, the two haven’t always mixed well. Newcomers to crypto, who typically have the highest appetite for intuitive UX, tend to find DeFi overly complex.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this tension, MoonPay saw an opportunity to bridge-the-gap by providing seamless cash-to-crypto onboarding to the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, MetaMask. Integrating with MoonPay allowed MetaMask’s millions of users to interface with DeFi through familiar payment options like credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. It also allowed MetaMask users to benefit from MoonPay’s stringent security protocols.</p>\n<h2>Simplifying ramps to protect users</h2>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the integration is that users can purchase digital assets directly within MetaMask wallet — eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms. This approach smoothes out the process, while keeping users’ information safe. By avoiding unnecessary third-party platforms, data exposure is minimized.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing exposure by helping users stay within the platform, MoonPay is committed to protection and security in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ramps are built with advanced encryption technology like AES-256.</li>\n<li>We comply with PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 standards, ensuring we meet stringent data security criteria.</li>\n<li>Our systems have undergone independent audits for PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001/27018, and SOC2 Type 2 certifications, giving users peace of mind that our safety standards don’t waver.</li>\n<li>Our rigorous Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies helps prevent bad actors from entering our ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating a more secure web3</h2>\n<p>As we continue to work alongside MetaMask, our shared focus on safe, user-friendly solutions remains a cornerstone of this partnership. Together, we’re not only simplifying crypto onboarding for newcomers – we’re setting the bar for what it means to prioritize security in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and selling crypto with your MetaMask wallet via MoonPay has never been easier.
