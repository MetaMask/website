Until now, most security features required data to be shared with third parties for validation to provide alerts. With this new feature, MetaMask just became the <strong>first crypto wallet that allows you to choose both privacy and security when enabling alerts.</strong></p>\n<p>Together with <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/emerging-from-stealth-with-33-m-in-funding-to-secure-web3\">Blockaid</a>, we’ve developed a <strong>unique privacy-preserving feature that simulates a transaction before signing and alerts you to scams</strong>. The new enhanced security alert (previously tested with the Opensea feature) is opt-in and available on Ethereum Mainnet currently. You can toggle it on under “Settings” in the “Experimental” tab to validate your transactions before confirming them.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTgDaffUf1A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This unique functionality sets a new standard for security in web3 while eliminating the need to share user data with third parties. To learn more about this feature and how it works, check out our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/19878220833947-How-to-turn-on-Blockaid-security-alerts\">knowledge base article</a>.</p>\n<h3>Detecting and preventing scams before they spread</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>When Vitalik’s Twitter account got hacked last month, Blockaid’s system <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/wallet-drainers-vitalik-metamask\">detected</a> the malicious dapp 24 hours before the tweet went live. Users who had Blockaid’s protection enabled in their wallets were alerted as soon as they connected to the dapp and additionally when they were asked to sign a transaction from the phishing site. This feature helped protect over $100k worth of assets from being stolen.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VitalikButerin</a>&#39;s X account got hacked, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blockaid_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Blockaid_</a> was able to detect the malicious site &gt;24h before it was uploaded to his page.<br><br>MetaMask + Blockaid are working to mitigate these situations and make web3 safer for everyone. <a href=\"https://t.co/yiRDXoRoS8\">pic.twitter.com/yiRDXoRoS8</a></p>&mdash; MetaMask 🦊🫰 (@MetaMask) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1702678994565382402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Similarly, when Uniswap founder Hayden Adam’s Twitter account got hacked, this technology was able to <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/wallet-drainers-vitalik-metamask\">detect the dapp</a> and flag it as malicious in MetaMask and Blockaid’s joint Opensea experimental feature.</p>\n<p>While we hope there won’t be a next time in terms of phishing and scams to this extent—with Blockaid estimating 1 in 10 dapps created are malicious—there will be.</p>\n<p>Unintended transaction outcomes have ranked among the most common causes of fund loss incidents within MetaMask—approving transactions that do something you didn’t intend to. Examples include transferring all your ETH to someone, selling a valuable NFT for nothing, and allowing someone to withdraw all your funds.</p>\n<p>In April 2023 we introduced an experimental opt-in Opensea alert that <strong>helped secure $500M of assets</strong> that could have been compromised. Due to the success of this experiment, we suspect that this evolved privacy-preserving security alert from MetaMask and Blockaid will help prevent billions of dollars worth of assets from being pillaged.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/106vc8sDaEmbDxrJpXiPPC/67a27974fbf5de6114950c746b92eb54/image__39_.png\" alt=\"image (39)\"></p>\n<p>We’re thrilled to share this feature directly in MetaMask to help protect our users’ assets and prevent unintended transaction outcomes.</p>\n<h3>Defense in depth: Snaps, phishing detection, triage, and education</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>With security being a top priority at MetaMask, we take a multi-pronged approach to our defense strategy. Last month saw the monumental release of MetaMask Snaps with a whole trove of community-built features designed to provide <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/how-to-keep-your-metamask-account-safe-with-security-snaps/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">transaction insights</a>. These features are built by community developers to extend MetaMask’s capabilities and shield your wallet, complementing MetaMask’s underlying infrastructure and new security features.</p>\n<p>By providing you with critical information before confirming transactions, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">Snaps</a> add extra layers of protection to your wallet instead of relying on one single functionality.</p>\n<p>In addition to Snaps, we’re working to expand the coverage of the <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4428045875483--Deceptive-site-ahead-when-trying-to-connect-to-a-site?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">MetaMask Phishing Detect</a> list. This list flags malicious dapps before you even try to connect your wallet, and our team is constantly researching new types of scam activity and working with our partners to address them.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMaskSupport?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">MetaMask Support</a> team is closely working with a selection of tools and other partners to help triage issues reported by users and quickly respond when someone has lost their assets.</p>\n<p>Finally, we believe education is important to avoid scams. Initiatives like MetaMask Learn help provide a free educational platform to those new or interested in web3 with short, engaging lessons like this <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/security-in-web3?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">Security</a> module that helps detect bad actors and reinforces the principle of never sharing your SRP with anyone. Our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/security/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">monthly security reports</a> also provide comprehensive updates from our team that keep up with the evolving security landscape day in and day out.</p>\n<h3>Prioritizing innovation, privacy, and security with multiple layers</h3>\n<br > \n<p>Whether it’s privacy-preserving alerts, threat detection, or novel trust paradigms, we’re continuously working with web3 partners to examine new opportunities, angles, and approaches to security.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
