Until now, most security features required data to be shared with third parties for validation to provide alerts. With this new feature, MetaMask just became the <strong>first crypto wallet that allows you to choose both privacy and security when enabling alerts.</strong></p>\n<p>Together with <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/emerging-from-stealth-with-33-m-in-funding-to-secure-web3\">Blockaid</a>, we’ve developed a <strong>unique privacy-preserving feature that simulates a transaction before signing and alerts you to scams</strong>. The new enhanced security alert (previously tested with the Opensea feature) is opt-in and available on Ethereum Mainnet currently. You can toggle it on under “Settings” in the “Experimental” tab to validate your transactions before confirming them.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTgDaffUf1A\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This unique functionality sets a new standard for security in web3 while eliminating the need to share user data with third parties. To learn more about this feature and how it works, check out our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/19878220833947-How-to-turn-on-Blockaid-security-alerts\">knowledge base article</a>.</p>\n<h3>Detecting and preventing scams before they spread</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>When Vitalik’s Twitter account got hacked last month, Blockaid’s system <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/wallet-drainers-vitalik-metamask\">detected</a> the malicious dapp 24 hours before the tweet went live. Users who had Blockaid’s protection enabled in their wallets were alerted as soon as they connected to the dapp and additionally when they were asked to sign a transaction from the phishing site. This feature helped protect over $100k worth of assets from being stolen.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VitalikButerin</a>&#39;s X account got hacked, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blockaid_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Blockaid_</a> was able to detect the malicious site &gt;24h before it was uploaded to his page.<br><br>MetaMask + Blockaid are working to mitigate these situations and make web3 safer for everyone. <a href=\"https://t.co/yiRDXoRoS8\">pic.twitter.com/yiRDXoRoS8</a></p>&mdash; MetaMask 🦊🫰 (@MetaMask) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1702678994565382402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Similarly, when Uniswap founder Hayden Adam’s Twitter account got hacked, this technology was able to <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/wallet-drainers-vitalik-metamask\">detect the dapp</a> and flag it as malicious in MetaMask and Blockaid’s joint Opensea experimental feature.</p>\n<p>While we hope there won’t be a next time in terms of phishing and scams to this extent—with Blockaid estimating 1 in 10 dapps created are malicious—there will be.</p>\n<p>Unintended transaction outcomes have ranked among the most common causes of fund loss incidents within MetaMask—approving transactions that do something you didn’t intend to. Examples include transferring all your ETH to someone, selling a valuable NFT for nothing, and allowing someone to withdraw all your funds.</p>\n<p>In April 2023 we introduced an experimental opt-in Opensea alert that <strong>helped secure $500M of assets</strong> that could have been compromised. Due to the success of this experiment, we suspect that this evolved privacy-preserving security alert from MetaMask and Blockaid will help prevent billions of dollars worth of assets from being pillaged.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/106vc8sDaEmbDxrJpXiPPC/67a27974fbf5de6114950c746b92eb54/image__39_.png\" alt=\"image (39)\"></p>\n<p>We’re thrilled to share this feature directly in MetaMask to help protect our users’ assets and prevent unintended transaction outcomes.</p>\n<h3>Defense in depth: Snaps, phishing detection, triage, and education</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>With security being a top priority at MetaMask, we take a multi-pronged approach to our defense strategy. Last month saw the monumental release of MetaMask Snaps with a whole trove of community-built features designed to provide <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/how-to-keep-your-metamask-account-safe-with-security-snaps/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">transaction insights</a>. These features are built by community developers to extend MetaMask’s capabilities and shield your wallet, complementing MetaMask’s underlying infrastructure and new security features.</p>\n<p>By providing you with critical information before confirming transactions, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">Snaps</a> add extra layers of protection to your wallet instead of relying on one single functionality.</p>\n<p>In addition to Snaps, we’re working to expand the coverage of the <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4428045875483--Deceptive-site-ahead-when-trying-to-connect-to-a-site?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">MetaMask Phishing Detect</a> list. This list flags malicious dapps before you even try to connect your wallet, and our team is constantly researching new types of scam activity and working with our partners to address them.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMaskSupport?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">MetaMask Support</a> team is closely working with a selection of tools and other partners to help triage issues reported by users and quickly respond when someone has lost their assets.</p>\n<p>Finally, we believe education is important to avoid scams. Initiatives like MetaMask Learn help provide a free educational platform to those new or interested in web3 with short, engaging lessons like this <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/security-in-web3?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">Security</a> module that helps detect bad actors and reinforces the principle of never sharing your SRP with anyone. Our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/security/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">monthly security reports</a> also provide comprehensive updates from our team that keep up with the evolving security landscape day in and day out.</p>\n<h3>Prioritizing innovation, privacy, and security with multiple layers</h3>\n<br > \n<p>Whether it’s privacy-preserving alerts, threat detection, or novel trust paradigms, we’re continuously working with web3 partners to examine new opportunities, angles, and approaches to security. We’re committed to providing a breadth of choice for you to shield your wallet.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2><strong>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</strong></h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</strong></p>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2><strong>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</strong></h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><strong>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
