However, the complexity of blockchain protocols like Ethereum necessitates an interface for users to harness this potential. 100 million users later, MetaMask has become that interface for many, although it’s got here despite a bit of a problem.</p>\n<p>That problem is the fact that every user who wants to claim a self-custodial wallet with MetaMask needs to record a twelve-word <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432\">Secret Recovery Phrase</a> as they are onboarded. These twelve words form the crux of the MetaMask experience, generating the cryptographic keys that create the accounts holding valuable assets.</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/hJgxOej0e1AUdixI7ekYg/6c8be8608e2849bae86c75f6f35f02e6/confirm_SRP.png\" alt=\"confirm SRP\" width=\"744\" height=\"407\" />\n<p>When MetaMask started over seven years ago the Secret Recovery Phrase was an elegant solution to the problem of representing cryptographic keys (having its roots in the Bitcoin community <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/e6abf7e66d7a499696dc9ef152f2c9eaa5b1b8ef\">as far back as 2013</a>). The corresponding cryptographic algorithm is incredibly scalable, interoperable, and ultimately gives users a uniquely secure method to transport potentially limitless amounts of value around the world providing they can keep those twelve-words secret and safe.</p>\n<p>However, maintaining the secrecy and safety of these twelve-words is a daunting task. I’ve personally read countless heart wrenching stories of MetaMask users reporting they’ve lost their twelve-words and so cannot access their funds anymore. Worse still, users often fall prey to phishing scams, handing over their Secret Recovery Phrase and having their assets stolen. This single point of failure also presents a tempting target for hackers.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit clichéd for anyone familiar with this problem to reiterate once again, but there has to be a better way.</p>\n<h3>Hardware Wallet Integrations As A Stepping Stone</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>For a while, MetaMask attempted to solve some of the problems with the Secret Recovery Phrase by integrating as many different hardware wallets as possible. These are devices that store cryptographic keys offline, and so make it much more <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/security-in-web3\">difficult for a hacker to infiltrate</a>. Following this strategy, we started to integrate all the major hardware wallets available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/20uoX5DMabgECizKMxcqmD/2149c4aca79c7e35613ebdf8f10199ef/hardware_wallets.jpeg\" alt=\"hardware wallets\"></p>\n<p>The Grid+ Lattice 1, Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, and Keystone Pro are just some of the hardware wallets integrated with MetaMask. More info at <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4408552261275-Hardware-Wallet-Hub\">MetaMask’s hardware wallet hub.</a></p>\n<p>However, these integrations are labor intensive, technically challenging, and require careful partnership management. By way of example, our <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-metamask-strengthen-partnership-ledger-nano-x-soon-compatible-with-metamask-mobile-app\">MetaMask Mobile Ledger integration</a> has been delayed by over a year (we’re still <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/8246\">working on it though</a>, I promise!). Additionally, as a result of these challenges, we’ve had to say “no” to numerous other integration requests over the years, even when a company has come to us with a fully functioning branch of the MetaMask codebase supporting their product (sorry <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/12097\">BitBox</a>!). With everything else we’re trying to accomplish, it’s just impossible to spare the time to review those hundreds of lines of code and then finally merge, while also ensuring our high security and stability standards.</p>\n<p>This has never felt right. A lot of us at MetaMask, myself included, got involved in this industry due to its decentralized permissionless promise, not to become de-facto gatekeepers. To remedy this problem to a degree, we worked with <a href=\"https://keyst.one/\">Keystone</a> to integrate a permissionless method of <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/metamask-x-keystone-how-to-benefit-from-hardware-wallet-security-using-transparent-qr-code\">integrating hardware wallets into MetaMask via QR codes</a>. Now as long as a third party hardware wallet manufacturer can adopt this QR code connectivity standard (<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4527\">ERC-4527</a>) they can integrate with MetaMask without ever engaging with us. Gone was the temporary role of being a hardware wallet integration gatekeeper.</p>\n<p>Although our industry never sits still.</p>\n<h3>Account Management Snaps As The Future</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Over the past few years our industry has seen huge advancements in account management. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation\">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> has become quicker and more performant to allow the generation of cryptographic keys across different nodes: eliminating single sources of failure in certain contexts. Smart contract accounts are also becoming more accessible and cheaper via various Ethereum scaling solutions and improvements in line with <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337\">ERC-4337</a>: say hello to social recovery and biometric signing. Hardware wallets also continue to develop: see the recent announcements of the new <a href=\"https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-stax\">Ledger Stax</a>, <a href=\"https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-3\">Trezor Safe 3</a>, and <a href=\"https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-3pro\">Keystone 3 Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, it’s impossible for one team to integrate and then maintain all of these account management solutions. Moreover, betting on a single solution is probably just as unfeasible, given the rapid pace of our industry and the diverse needs of the next billion blockchain users that MetaMask aims to serve.</p>\n<p>The only way to begin imagining how to integrate all of these different account management solutions is to <strong>make the wallet more community driven</strong>, by reinventing the software of the wallet entirely, which is precisely what MetaMask Snaps does. In the words of MetaMask's co-founder Dan Finlay an end goal of MetaMask Snaps is \"<a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/snaps-in-metamask-stable-and-where-we-go-from-here/#:~:text=permissionless%20computing\">permissionless computing</a>\". This is a lofty goal when making a security-sensitive product, but it’s perhaps the only way to drive MetaMask towards the vision of creating a gateway to web3 for everyone.</p>\n<p>Today marks a critical milestone in that journey as we enable new Snap APIs to enable community driven features around one of the most important components of any wallet – account management – to start chipping away at the problems associated with the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>\n<p>To enable new account management experiences we’re launching the powerful <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> today in MetaMask Extension, which any developer can use to bring their account management ideas to MetaMask. Launching any product update like this is daunting, which is why today also marks the beginning of our Experimental Beta program for Account Management Snaps. We didn’t want to continue building out this functionality behind closed doors, so if you’re a power-user comfortable testing out advanced features, we invite you to test out our first three Snaps in this category (<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>) and to <a href=\"https://feedback.metamask.io/account-management-snaps\">let us know what you think.</a></p>\n<h3>Account Management Snaps In Action</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>You can install these new Snaps via the official <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Snaps Directory</a>, however you can also go to the Experimental Settings in the MetaMask Extension to test a new Account Management Snap interface. Once an Account Management Snap is installed and set up, it will appear in your MetaMask Account List and function like any other account in MetaMask, such as allowing you to transact and interact with dapps.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6bmintWlFPuldZ6E9pF5Sz/805b0f173f657fc626659f97e4d28f53/selectanaccount.png\" alt=\"selectanaccount\"></p>\n<p>Please note that all Snaps are third-party services and are used at your own risk. However, we're excited by what the community has already created. The first version of the Keyring API is particularly well-suited to Multi-Factor Authentication experiences powered by MPC, reducing the single point of failure limitation of the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>\n<h3>Silent Shard</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Silent Shard creates a two-factor-authentication experience with MetaMask’s Extension and a companion smartphone app. For added usability, you can save a part of your private key in your Apple or Google password manager.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ewBdIQuKg4?si=vZVrV8aMgsliTHrK\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <button style=\"font-size: 17px; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer;\">Install Snap</button>\n</a>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>Safeheron</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Safeheron is a 2/3 multi-factor-authentication experience between MetaMask Extension and two smartphone apps.

For Account Management Snaps we’re also requiring an additional audit on their MPC code (or equivalent like a smart contract of hardware wallet) with that being made publicly available as well. Over time we’ll eventually get towards a true <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/permissionless-innovation-and-you/\">permissionless ecosystem</a> and if that is something important to you today, we recommend our developer-centric product <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth confirming that the Keyring API has an architecture where these Snaps cannot access your existing MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase. These new Snaps must either generate an entirely new private key or derive an entirely new private key from your Secret Recovery Phrase that prevents them from accessing other Ethereum accounts. Account Management Snaps also benefit from the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/execution-environment\">secure sandboxed execution environment</a> that all Snaps run in.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We're thrilled about today's release, and this is just the beginning. We’re confident that the first Snaps to use the new Keyring API will continue to improve, and we’re also planning to enhance the Keyring API itself. We’re currently hard at work enabling the sending of userOps to support ERC-4337 smart contract accounts, and we’re experimenting with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask.flask\">Snaps on mobile</a> too.</p>\n<p>Starting today, if you’re a power-user looking to experiment with new features, you should download the latest version of <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask Extension</a> and give Account Management Snaps a whirl. If you're a developer interested in building with us, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API docs</a>. If you have a concrete Account Management Snap idea, we'd <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6ZuGaA2zRM3UA_CZhe0RD5DCQ5XbjiNIUh8sqs4kadv6rLA/viewform\">love to hear about it</a>.

was overshadowed by platforms that censored players and game developers from being able to use their crypto assets within games. We set out to build a secure, censorship-resistant, free-market gaming platform that not only offered greater flexibility and ownership than the web2 paradigm, but also provided a more accessible cross-platform experience. Today, we are entering a new era of gaming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/15BcZsL1lavnanKVEvyfz3/14eb170ac038e038d21f4438dfb14dcf/image1.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay MetaMask onboarding screen\"></p>\n<h2>Replacing the old formula</h2>\n<p>While the web2 gaming world continues to cling to its old ways, <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay’s</a> web3-friendly game store allows players to carry their in-game assets across all games, offering them <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/@hyperplay/game-asset-ownership-matters-%E2%80%94-heres-why\">true ownership</a> and autonomy, without fear of de-platforming.<a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet</a> is a key tool in this effort, eliminating obstacles for gamers and developers alike.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/how-hyperplay-is-building-a-web3-game-store-with-the-metamask-developer/\">game store</a> brings token swaps, cross-chain bridging, and easy cash to crypto on-ramping into every game through our in-game overlay. This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful combination. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks or buy crypto with fiat.

Earlier this year, MetaMask elevated the multichain experience by <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/improved-multi-dapp-experience-in-metamask-extension/\">remembering the network</a> used for each dapp, eliminating the need for manual network switching when using multiple dapps simultaneously. Our new update takes it a step further. Users can now sign transactions on any permitted network, without needing to approve the network switch.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4oSFXT2U54?si=SPpXVhEIROyz47hY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Permissions are granted to each dapp at the time of connection, and can always be managed by the user to maintain flexibility and control. When users connect a dapp, the account that they are on, and all default enabled networks, will be permissioned for that dapp. You can edit at the time of connection, or after the connection has been made in the All Permissions section. Home stakers, and others preferring their own infrastructure, can also review and update their chosen RPC url as needed.</p>\n<p>Having control over the networks that dapps have access to adds a security layer—minimizing the impact of interacting with potentially malicious dapps to permitted networks. As the multichain ecosystem continues to expand, MetaMask is here to meet your needs and keep you protected along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you're using the latest version of <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask Extension</a> for optimal security, and visit our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/using-metamask/how-to-update-the-version-of-metamask/\">support page</a> to learn how to stay up to date.
