However, the complexity of blockchain protocols like Ethereum necessitates an interface for users to harness this potential. 100 million users later, MetaMask has become that interface for many, although it’s got here despite a bit of a problem.</p>\n<p>That problem is the fact that every user who wants to claim a self-custodial wallet with MetaMask needs to record a twelve-word <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432\">Secret Recovery Phrase</a> as they are onboarded. These twelve words form the crux of the MetaMask experience, generating the cryptographic keys that create the accounts holding valuable assets.</p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/hJgxOej0e1AUdixI7ekYg/6c8be8608e2849bae86c75f6f35f02e6/confirm_SRP.png\" alt=\"confirm SRP\" width=\"744\" height=\"407\" />\n<p>When MetaMask started over seven years ago the Secret Recovery Phrase was an elegant solution to the problem of representing cryptographic keys (having its roots in the Bitcoin community <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/commit/e6abf7e66d7a499696dc9ef152f2c9eaa5b1b8ef\">as far back as 2013</a>). The corresponding cryptographic algorithm is incredibly scalable, interoperable, and ultimately gives users a uniquely secure method to transport potentially limitless amounts of value around the world providing they can keep those twelve-words secret and safe.</p>\n<p>However, maintaining the secrecy and safety of these twelve-words is a daunting task. I’ve personally read countless heart wrenching stories of MetaMask users reporting they’ve lost their twelve-words and so cannot access their funds anymore. Worse still, users often fall prey to phishing scams, handing over their Secret Recovery Phrase and having their assets stolen. This single point of failure also presents a tempting target for hackers.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit clichéd for anyone familiar with this problem to reiterate once again, but there has to be a better way.</p>\n<h3>Hardware Wallet Integrations As A Stepping Stone</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>For a while, MetaMask attempted to solve some of the problems with the Secret Recovery Phrase by integrating as many different hardware wallets as possible. These are devices that store cryptographic keys offline, and so make it much more <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/security-in-web3\">difficult for a hacker to infiltrate</a>. Following this strategy, we started to integrate all the major hardware wallets available.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/20uoX5DMabgECizKMxcqmD/2149c4aca79c7e35613ebdf8f10199ef/hardware_wallets.jpeg\" alt=\"hardware wallets\"></p>\n<p>The Grid+ Lattice 1, Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, and Keystone Pro are just some of the hardware wallets integrated with MetaMask. More info at <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4408552261275-Hardware-Wallet-Hub\">MetaMask’s hardware wallet hub.</a></p>\n<p>However, these integrations are labor intensive, technically challenging, and require careful partnership management. By way of example, our <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/blog/ledger-metamask-strengthen-partnership-ledger-nano-x-soon-compatible-with-metamask-mobile-app\">MetaMask Mobile Ledger integration</a> has been delayed by over a year (we’re still <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/8246\">working on it though</a>, I promise!). Additionally, as a result of these challenges, we’ve had to say “no” to numerous other integration requests over the years, even when a company has come to us with a fully functioning branch of the MetaMask codebase supporting their product (sorry <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/12097\">BitBox</a>!). With everything else we’re trying to accomplish, it’s just impossible to spare the time to review those hundreds of lines of code and then finally merge, while also ensuring our high security and stability standards.</p>\n<p>This has never felt right. A lot of us at MetaMask, myself included, got involved in this industry due to its decentralized permissionless promise, not to become de-facto gatekeepers. To remedy this problem to a degree, we worked with <a href=\"https://keyst.one/\">Keystone</a> to integrate a permissionless method of <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/metamask-x-keystone-how-to-benefit-from-hardware-wallet-security-using-transparent-qr-code\">integrating hardware wallets into MetaMask via QR codes</a>. Now as long as a third party hardware wallet manufacturer can adopt this QR code connectivity standard (<a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4527\">ERC-4527</a>) they can integrate with MetaMask without ever engaging with us. Gone was the temporary role of being a hardware wallet integration gatekeeper.</p>\n<p>Although our industry never sits still.</p>\n<h3>Account Management Snaps As The Future</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Over the past few years our industry has seen huge advancements in account management. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation\">Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</a> has become quicker and more performant to allow the generation of cryptographic keys across different nodes: eliminating single sources of failure in certain contexts. Smart contract accounts are also becoming more accessible and cheaper via various Ethereum scaling solutions and improvements in line with <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337\">ERC-4337</a>: say hello to social recovery and biometric signing. Hardware wallets also continue to develop: see the recent announcements of the new <a href=\"https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-stax\">Ledger Stax</a>, <a href=\"https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-3\">Trezor Safe 3</a>, and <a href=\"https://keyst.one/shop/products/keystone-3pro\">Keystone 3 Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, it’s impossible for one team to integrate and then maintain all of these account management solutions. Moreover, betting on a single solution is probably just as unfeasible, given the rapid pace of our industry and the diverse needs of the next billion blockchain users that MetaMask aims to serve.</p>\n<p>The only way to begin imagining how to integrate all of these different account management solutions is to <strong>make the wallet more community driven</strong>, by reinventing the software of the wallet entirely, which is precisely what MetaMask Snaps does. In the words of MetaMask's co-founder Dan Finlay an end goal of MetaMask Snaps is \"<a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/snaps-in-metamask-stable-and-where-we-go-from-here/#:~:text=permissionless%20computing\">permissionless computing</a>\". This is a lofty goal when making a security-sensitive product, but it’s perhaps the only way to drive MetaMask towards the vision of creating a gateway to web3 for everyone.</p>\n<p>Today marks a critical milestone in that journey as we enable new Snap APIs to enable community driven features around one of the most important components of any wallet – account management – to start chipping away at the problems associated with the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>\n<p>To enable new account management experiences we’re launching the powerful <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> today in MetaMask Extension, which any developer can use to bring their account management ideas to MetaMask. Launching any product update like this is daunting, which is why today also marks the beginning of our Experimental Beta program for Account Management Snaps. We didn’t want to continue building out this functionality behind closed doors, so if you’re a power-user comfortable testing out advanced features, we invite you to test out our first three Snaps in this category (<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>) and to <a href=\"https://feedback.metamask.io/account-management-snaps\">let us know what you think.</a></p>\n<h3>Account Management Snaps In Action</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>You can install these new Snaps via the official <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Snaps Directory</a>, however you can also go to the Experimental Settings in the MetaMask Extension to test a new Account Management Snap interface. Once an Account Management Snap is installed and set up, it will appear in your MetaMask Account List and function like any other account in MetaMask, such as allowing you to transact and interact with dapps.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6bmintWlFPuldZ6E9pF5Sz/805b0f173f657fc626659f97e4d28f53/selectanaccount.png\" alt=\"selectanaccount\"></p>\n<p>Please note that all Snaps are third-party services and are used at your own risk. However, we're excited by what the community has already created. The first version of the Keyring API is particularly well-suited to Multi-Factor Authentication experiences powered by MPC, reducing the single point of failure limitation of the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>\n<h3>Silent Shard</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Silent Shard creates a two-factor-authentication experience with MetaMask’s Extension and a companion smartphone app. For added usability, you can save a part of your private key in your Apple or Google password manager.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ewBdIQuKg4?si=vZVrV8aMgsliTHrK\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <button style=\"font-size: 17px; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer;\">Install Snap</button>\n</a>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>Safeheron</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Safeheron is a 2/3 multi-factor-authentication experience between MetaMask Extension and two smartphone apps.

You can also connect this account with any other Capsule account created on a third party website.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-h3SuWK0nY?si=Ly9m0M7U7ruc_zJb\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <button style=\"font-size: 17px; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer;\">Install Snap</button>\n</a>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We currently require all Snaps that integrate with MetaMask Extension to have completed an independent code audit on their Snap. For Account Management Snaps we’re also requiring an additional audit on their MPC code (or equivalent like a smart contract of hardware wallet) with that being made publicly available as well. Over time we’ll eventually get towards a true <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/permissionless-innovation-and-you/\">permissionless ecosystem</a> and if that is something important to you today, we recommend our developer-centric product <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">MetaMask Flask</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth confirming that the Keyring API has an architecture where these Snaps cannot access your existing MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase. These new Snaps must either generate an entirely new private key or derive an entirely new private key from your Secret Recovery Phrase that prevents them from accessing other Ethereum accounts. Account Management Snaps also benefit from the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/execution-environment\">secure sandboxed execution environment</a> that all Snaps run in.</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We're thrilled about today's release, and this is just the beginning. We’re confident that the first Snaps to use the new Keyring API will continue to improve, and we’re also planning to enhance the Keyring API itself. We’re currently hard at work enabling the sending of userOps to support ERC-4337 smart contract accounts, and we’re experimenting with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask.flask\">Snaps on mobile</a> too.</p>\n<p>Starting today, if you’re a power-user looking to experiment with new features, you should download the latest version of <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask Extension</a> and give Account Management Snaps a whirl.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br></p>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 gaming players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ assets.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith self-custody comes gamers’ responsibility of security their assets. The decentralized security <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. So, digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask is continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Head to <a href=\"https://www.yooldo.gg/\">Yooldo</a> to get started.</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5MAd44lGpkFDLHmOSPDCiU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask now compatible with NGRAVE hardware wallet","slug":"metamask-compatible-hardware wallet ngrave","subtitle":"For a more secure self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask hardware wallet integration NGRAVE","description":"MetaMask now has hardware wallet integration with NGRAVE","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=webp 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"},{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=240&h=135&q=80&fm=gif 240w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=gif 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NWUsBwJ790SB7DWa9jXLc/bb1a548ad81cd541938465c2b925ae16/MetaMask_hardware_wallet_integration_NGRAVE.gif?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=gif 960w","sizes":"(min-width: 960px) 960px, 100vw","type":"image/gif"}]},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"October 16, 2024","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask has announced its integration with NGRAVE on Extension and Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence. MetaMask and ChainPatrol continue to innovate solutions for the unique security challenges that target the crypto ecosystem. Through further collaboration with the <a href=\"https://securityalliance.org/\">Security Alliance (SEAL)</a>, MetaMask and ChainPatrol are ensuring new threat signals from across a community of security exports can trigger warnings before users are impacted.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning of a growing security initiative across the crypto ecosystem. MetaMask and ChainPatrol have a shared goal of creating a web3 that users can confidently and safely browse every day.</p>\n<p><strong>To learn more about MetaMask ETH-phishing-detect, visit our <a
