This is why MetaMask is deeply committed to user consent and choice when handling personal information and why we’re constantly evolving MetaMask to be equipped with the functionality and features that allow you the freedom to choose how your data is used, while preserving your privacy and security. Today we’re excited to highlight the comprehensive set of MetaMask features that do precisely this.</p>\n<h3>MetaMask privacy preserving features let you choose how your data is used</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask has always led the way in providing a configurable web3 wallet experience, starting with providing users a choice to select their preferred RPC providers. We envision a future where MetaMask empowers users to interact across the internet with complete, granular choice over their data and communication methods.</p>\n<p>We have continued to push the boundaries and lead the way for digital wallets by enhancing our default experiences and expanding our settings to provide users increasingly granular choice during and after onboarding.</p>\n<p>To that effect, we have continued to expand the range of features where we provide granular choice through advanced settings that users can access and configure from the moment they onboard, and at any point thereafter.</p>\n<p>When we introduce new features (eg, a new data feed or transaction optimization), we always make those new features subject to user choice and configurable, so that a user can toggle the feature off or on based on whether it satisfies their individual data or privacy preferences.</p>\n<p>Examples of these configurable settings and features include:</p>\n<p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong> Our default experiences provide users with certain basic features like gas estimations, details about your tokens, and warnings about potentially malicious sites. We think these features are foundational elements for a great wallet experience, but we nonetheless give users the ability to easily opt out of this basic wallet functionality with a single click.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/33rfZv3RSdVbTPXHQyHl4h/227fc0b1326a0d5270e6a69d5be7cc58/Default_settings_1.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p><strong>RPC Configuration:</strong> MetaMask is a software client on your device that interacts and communicates with blockchain networks such as Ethereum via standard RPC APIs (remote procedure call). We provide default RPC configurations for many networks, for example via Infura RPC endpoints, to make it easy for users to reliably interact with networks. But because, among other things, interacting with networks in this way necessarily requires your device to transmit data to-and-from the RPC endpoints, we also provide granular and configurable settings so that users can change their RPC endpoints at any time, including using entirely customized and personal RPC endpoints. See this article for more details.</p>\n<p><strong>Security Alerts:</strong> To help users stay safe, MetaMask simulates transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts. Users may choose to enable or disable this feature at any time.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/KX7HS2OPWzj4wjWoADYDI/a0cd123451020f5f8993ecbacb0a0050/security_alerts_blockaid.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p><strong>Phishing Detection:</strong> Before connecting to a dapp, MetaMask alerts users if it's identified as potentially malicious, using a publicly curated list of sites. This feature is configurable, allowing users to activate or deactivate it as they see fit.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-detect Tokens:</strong> This feature automatically identifies the assets in a user's wallet by utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources, eliminating the hassle of manually adding tokens. At any time, users can choose to enable or disable this functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Details Check:</strong> To improve user safety, MetaMask performs a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added. If discrepancies are found, users are alerted with a warning. Users can choose to enable or disable this feature at their discretion.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/NEzr7jGeAH9leKo0NnKAr/27b5b8d8e1697f30ad322b358db5810c/CustomNetwork.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p><strong>NFT Media Display:</strong> To display NFTs, MetaMask must retrieve the image files from third-party services where they are hosted, including decentralized storage solutions. This feature makes it easier for users to view and manage their NFTs but can be disabled – or enabled – at any time with the click of a button.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/41oBIRSpfiuCQ3JoUGCiR6/c42ef0746aa5e0b3c327db1dd32bcac6/NFT_display.png\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p><strong>Proposed Nicknames:</strong> To improve the wallet UX, MetaMask makes smart contract addresses more human-readable by suggesting unique names when interacting with them, utilizing third-party sources like Etherscan and Lens. Just like the features mentioned above, this functionality is optional and can be disabled.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/iq9b0QBQucsLFx1TsolWy/367c1d44ee74c12013bcaa571bae117e/MetaMask_apply_nickname.gif\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p><strong>Smart Transactions:</strong> This feature is designed to improve and optimize the transaction experience by offering higher success rates, better visibility, and enhanced security. It is optional and can be toggled on or off based on user preferences.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3ZIpptsDsFxBJ6dz2Sl59E/42f4012ce6a5b4d8237bcf3267578da6/smart_tx.gif\" alt=\"metametrics\" style=\"max-width: 30%; height: auto;\">\n</div>\n<p><strong>MetaMetrics:</strong> MetaMetrics is an analytics platform designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience by collecting non-sensitive user events.

In updating our company privacy notice, we have aimed to make it even more clear and informative about what we do, and do not do, with MetaMask user information. Here is a high-level summary of that overview - we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not collect your private keys.</li>\n<li>Do not sell your Personal Information.</li>\n<li>Do not collect or retain Personal Information unless necessary to provide you the Services and a great user experience.</li>\n<li>do not collect financial payment or banking information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For IP addresses in particular, we may temporarily process your IP address only where required for some of our Services (depending on your MetaMask settings) to provide the best possible experience for MetaMask users. This includes, for example, the prevention of DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>As we continue building towards a future where MetaMask empowers users with complete, granular choice over how and with whom they share data, you can help us by continuing to identify areas where we can improve.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
