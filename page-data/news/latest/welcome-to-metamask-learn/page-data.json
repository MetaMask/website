They are quick learners who adapt well through observation, play, and trial and error. As a web3 dabbler, I can find a lot in common with them.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of curiosity and learning, many teams within ConsenSys gathered together to bring <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> to life. It’s been a labor of love, and one we hope inspires the curious fox in all who come across it. We’re excited to finally share it with you today.</p>\n<h3>What is MetaMask Learn?</h3>\n<br />\n<p>MetaMask Learn is a free-to-use educational platform available in 10 languages for anyone interested in learning about web3. Through engaging lessons and interactive simulations, it helps you understand what web3 is, why it matters, and how to get started.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is for you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve been interested in web3 but just don’t know where to start</li>\n<li>You’ve bought some crypto on an exchange but don’t know what to do with it</li>\n<li>You still don’t understand web3 principles because they’ve been too jargon-heavy</li>\n<li>You want to know what the fuss about web3 really is</li>\n<li>You just want to keep up with your friends who babble about this new digital era and its possibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list could go on. But at its core, Learn is designed for anyone who wants to take the leap to explore uncharted waters. At a self-moderated pace, you can jump into any and all lessons that interest you, interact with features in the simulation, and experience those satisfying “ah-ha” moments when you finally grasp important concepts. As you may have heard, crypto wasn’t created to make you rich, it was created to set you free. And we like to think freedom is fun.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Learn syllabus will guide you through 8 initial topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-web3?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is Web3?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-crypto-wallet?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is a Crypto Wallet?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-era-of-digital-identity?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">The Era of Digital Identity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-self-custody-wallet?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is Self-Custody?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-advent-of-digital-ownership?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">The Advent of Digital Ownership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">NFTs and Creators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/finance-decentralized?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">Finance, Decentralized</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-age-of-communities?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">Age of Communities</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 10 languages: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Tagalog (Philippines), Bahasa\n(Indonesia), Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish.

As the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, we’ve seen a lot and recognize the steep learning curve when it comes to learning web3 concepts for the first time.</p>\n<p>In Gemini’s 2022 Global State of Crypto <a href=\"https://www.gemini.com/gemini-2022-state-of-crypto-global.pdf\">survey</a>, respondents were nearly twice as likely to say that more educational resources would help them get started with crypto (40%), compared to recommendations from friends (22%).</p>\n<p>If you’ve been looking for a place to send your family and friends to the next time you’re sharing your enthusiasm for web3, have <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> up your sleeve!</p>\n<p>In addition to helping educate more people in the space, we want to help combat scammers who prey on unsuspecting victims by equipping you with the fundamental knowledge to understand self-custody and true ownership.</p>\n<p>If you feel more confident in navigating the web3 waters after MetaMask Learn, we did our job. Pssst, never ever ever share your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) with anyone. Or click on weird links. <em>Just had to get that out there.</em></p>\n<h3>It Takes A Village</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Encompassing moments of delight throughout the experience, we want to thank our partner in this project, <a href=\"https://www.stinkstudios.com/\">Stink Studios</a> for bringing MetaMask Learn to life.</p>\n<p>The amount of successful scamming and phishing attempts reduce significantly when we equip people with knowledge.</p>\n<p>We collaborated with great organizations in the space that will all use MetaMask Learn as one of their go-to web3 onboarding guides.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6csGV1uy43SKECcotf0TjB/13b66ddd871677c0618a180f3e1e6741/MM_Learn_Partners_Feb_2023_Final.png\" alt=\"MM Learn Partners Feb 2023 Final\"></p>\n<p>From celebrating diverse communities and encouraging inclusivity with <em>Women of Web3, Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow, Crypto Tech Women, Women in Tech, the Ukraine Government, and Giving Block</em>…</p>\n<p>To welcoming the next wave of creators, artists, and gamers in the world of NFTs with <em>Animoca, Unity, and Sandbox</em>…</p>\n<p>And overall building more awareness around self-custody with <em>ENS, Moonpay, Transak, Sardine</em>…</p>\n<p>Thank you for the work that you do.</p>\n<p>To the dapp developer, NFT creator, and DAO steward reading this, <strong>add this to your onboarding guide</strong> for a frictionless experience for your new users.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is there to inspire you to learn about the new world we’re in. It’s not enough to just stay on the sidelines and only take notice when crypto exchange billionaires steal user funds, <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">you should know exactly where to go to learn more about web3</a>.</p>\n<p>And even if you’re a self-proclaimed expert in web3, I’m sure you know someone who would benefit from this—a friend, a family member, that random person on the sidewalk passing you by proclaiming how much they don’t understand “that crypto stuff.” Maybe now they will.</p>\n<h3>Stay Curious</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We hope you enjoy MetaMask Learn as it pops its head out of its den to say hello to the world. We plan on adding more support for languages in the near future to reflect our global audience and will continue to add lessons that pique your interest.</p>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">Twitter</a>. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@metamask\">TikTok</a> <em>(yes, Learn inspired us to create a TikTok to appeal to people who like consuming content a lil differently)</em>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/metamask.io/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/metamask.io\">Facebook</a>.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
