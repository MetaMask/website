To put the last six years into context, Bitcoin was created in 2009, Ethereum launched in 2015, and MetaMask made its appearance soon after in 2016 with the support of grant funding. The fox and its determined community have seen multiple highs, lows, bulls, and bears, and are excited about the adventure to come.</p>\n<p>To explore new avenues for decentralized growth and continue implementing Web3 native practices at ConsenSys, we are launching MetaMask Grants DAO: an employee-led, ConsenSys-funded <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">program that issues grants</a> to developers building impactful experiences within the MetaMask ecosystem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/105u4AcveOkVgsD5gNPOZR/094d44fcd7ae14829009af0a253a0539/v1__preferred_V2.png\" alt=\"timeline\"></p>\n<p>Well well, this foxtrot just got more interesting.</p>\n<h3>Why Grants DAO?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Of course, MetaMask wanted to be a DAO when we first started but there were no wallets to build a DAO with yet.” – Dan Finlay, co-founder of MetaMask</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we had to build a wallet first. And here we are.</p>\n<p>ConsenSys is dedicated to building a more open, empowering, and decentralized world. That's what motivates everyone in the company, including everyone on the MetaMask team. We all strive to build products and systems that are just as open, decentralized, and permissionless as the world we are shaping.</p>\n<p>Exploring Web3 mechanisms is core to the DNA of our company. ConsenSys has been experimenting with how to incorporate increasingly decentralized operations into a mature software company, as showcased by initiatives like the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-and-bankless-announce-the-first-ever-daolationship/\">Bankless DAOlationship</a>, Merge <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/ethereum-2-0/to-celebrate-the-merge-consensys-dropped-the-first-public-nft-mint-on-pos-ethereum/\">Regenesis NFT</a> drop, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/villagedao/what-is-villagedao-and-why-does-it-matter/\">VillageDAO</a>.</p>\n<p>Making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world requires decentralizing efforts to build it out and empower our communities. Not only will this accelerate growth for crypto-comfortable users, but this will also boost adoption for crypto-curious individuals that will have more paths to participate in.</p>\n<h3>A grand experiment</h3>\n<p>Since launching in 2016, we have learned a lot but there’s a lot more to learn alongside you and the entire industry. In this spirit, we are embracing this initiative as an experiment. Much like how <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">Flask</a> is a developmental laboratory, <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">Grants DAO</a> is a radical step to support the developer community through grant funding in building out a thriving landscape <em>(or metascape?)</em> that benefits more users.</p>\n<p>ConsenSys has laid the foundation for many projects, with MetaMask being a prime example. The fox was initially funded with a grant! Had no one believed in MetaMask at its inception, we wouldn’t be here, and we’d argue that the Web3 space would look completely different today.</p>\n<p>Grants DAO will continue that tradition to foster new ideas from which everyone can benefit, enabling the developer community to build with MetaMask in a way that’s valuable to them.</p>\n<p>The internal DAO will also enhance the collective mission of ConsenSys employees and give them a new way to engage and lean into their curiosity. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpeRkhunrMA&#x26;t=0s&#x26;ab_channel=MetaMask\">The very people who founded MetaMask</a> were profoundly curious, and ConsenSys employees, many of whom come from the Web3 community, are among the most curious in the world. Together, we take the leap to charter unknown waters, build new tech, and pioneer the way for other organizations. Grants DAO is our way to start giving back to the developer community that’s been on this ride with us to build great applications that boost Web3 adoption.</p>\n<h3>Okay, but how does it work?</h3>\n<p>Here are the details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MetaMask Grants DAO is an <strong>employee-driven, ConsenSys-funded DAO</strong> that issues grants to developers building impactful experiences within the MetaMask ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Every ConsenSys employee can opt-in to be a <strong>Grants DAO member</strong> with equal voting rights governed by a non-transferable token.</li>\n<li>The DAO is made up of two main parts:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employee-Led DAO:</strong> Heart of the DAO made up of all ConsenSys employees.</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership Committee (mini-DAO):</strong> Head of the DAO made up of 7 individuals responsible for finding high-potential projects, creating governance proposals, updating external content, gathering feedback on the DAO, driving improvements to the DAO, and queuing multisig transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The DAO uses a <strong>secure multisig wallet</strong> owned by ConsenSys that will manage the treasury, disbursement of funds, and minting or burning of tokens as employees join or leave the company.</li>\n<li>The DAO will fund two types of grants:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leadership Committee Grants:</strong> Any Leadership Committee member can make a proposal, and <strong>proposals with at least 5 \"yes\" votes at closing will pass.</strong> Leadership Committee grants are intended to provide a quick, easy mechanism for those most closely tied to the grants operations to ensure that high-quality projects that may be overlooked by the full DAO can be funded. Votes will be open for five days and the individual proposing the vote will be responsible for making the case and otherwise taking any actions they need to win the vote’s approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Full DAO Grants:</strong> Any Leadership Committee member can make a proposal to the Full DAO, and <strong>proposals with a simple majority “yes” at closing will pass.</strong> Votes will be open for ten days and the individual proposing the vote will be responsible for making the case and otherwise taking any actions they need to win the vote’s approval.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Grants DAO has a budget of <strong>$600,000 per quarter</strong> to fund meaningful projects.</li>\n<li>Voting and proposals will take place publicly through <strong>SnapShot</strong> on the Codefi Activate platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that’s the tea.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to learn more about this, more details are available here on the <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> page.</p>\n<p>And finally, have you participated in one of our dev-focused workshops or hackathons? Met our team at a conference and got inspired to tinker around with Snaps? Want to bring your features and APIs to the wallet? Well, here’s your chance. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU-lqYv-F8mmbClf7Ib8k4BEsYceItxDB2FnY3VGma1DqhHg/viewform?usp=sf_link\">Apply for a grant</a> to build out this ecosystem with us.</p>\n<p>*We can’t guarantee when we will review your request or that it will get approved, but know that our team will review the application pipeline as often as we can. Thanks for being patient with us. *</p>\n<p>Beyond the amazing projects we hope to fund with the DAO, Grants DAO is an opportunity for us to experiment with and learn from governance models to influence the direction of future projects. Cheers to another long ride with the fox.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
