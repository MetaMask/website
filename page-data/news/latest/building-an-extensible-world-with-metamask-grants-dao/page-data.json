To put the last six years into context, Bitcoin was created in 2009, Ethereum launched in 2015, and MetaMask made its appearance soon after in 2016 with the support of grant funding. The fox and its determined community have seen multiple highs, lows, bulls, and bears, and are excited about the adventure to come.</p>\n<p>To explore new avenues for decentralized growth and continue implementing Web3 native practices at ConsenSys, we are launching MetaMask Grants DAO: an employee-led, ConsenSys-funded <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">program that issues grants</a> to developers building impactful experiences within the MetaMask ecosystem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/105u4AcveOkVgsD5gNPOZR/094d44fcd7ae14829009af0a253a0539/v1__preferred_V2.png\" alt=\"timeline\"></p>\n<p>Well well, this foxtrot just got more interesting.</p>\n<h3>Why Grants DAO?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Of course, MetaMask wanted to be a DAO when we first started but there were no wallets to build a DAO with yet.” – Dan Finlay, co-founder of MetaMask</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we had to build a wallet first. And here we are.</p>\n<p>ConsenSys is dedicated to building a more open, empowering, and decentralized world. That's what motivates everyone in the company, including everyone on the MetaMask team. We all strive to build products and systems that are just as open, decentralized, and permissionless as the world we are shaping.</p>\n<p>Exploring Web3 mechanisms is core to the DNA of our company. ConsenSys has been experimenting with how to incorporate increasingly decentralized operations into a mature software company, as showcased by initiatives like the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-and-bankless-announce-the-first-ever-daolationship/\">Bankless DAOlationship</a>, Merge <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/ethereum-2-0/to-celebrate-the-merge-consensys-dropped-the-first-public-nft-mint-on-pos-ethereum/\">Regenesis NFT</a> drop, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/villagedao/what-is-villagedao-and-why-does-it-matter/\">VillageDAO</a>.</p>\n<p>Making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world requires decentralizing efforts to build it out and empower our communities. Not only will this accelerate growth for crypto-comfortable users, but this will also boost adoption for crypto-curious individuals that will have more paths to participate in.</p>\n<h3>A grand experiment</h3>\n<p>Since launching in 2016, we have learned a lot but there’s a lot more to learn alongside you and the entire industry. In this spirit, we are embracing this initiative as an experiment. Much like how <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/\">Flask</a> is a developmental laboratory, <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">Grants DAO</a> is a radical step to support the developer community through grant funding in building out a thriving landscape <em>(or metascape?)</em> that benefits more users.</p>\n<p>ConsenSys has laid the foundation for many projects, with MetaMask being a prime example. The fox was initially funded with a grant! Had no one believed in MetaMask at its inception, we wouldn’t be here, and we’d argue that the Web3 space would look completely different today.</p>\n<p>Grants DAO will continue that tradition to foster new ideas from which everyone can benefit, enabling the developer community to build with MetaMask in a way that’s valuable to them.</p>\n<p>The internal DAO will also enhance the collective mission of ConsenSys employees and give them a new way to engage and lean into their curiosity. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpeRkhunrMA&#x26;t=0s&#x26;ab_channel=MetaMask\">The very people who founded MetaMask</a> were profoundly curious, and ConsenSys employees, many of whom come from the Web3 community, are among the most curious in the world. Together, we take the leap to charter unknown waters, build new tech, and pioneer the way for other organizations. Grants DAO is our way to start giving back to the developer community that’s been on this ride with us to build great applications that boost Web3 adoption.</p>\n<h3>Okay, but how does it work?</h3>\n<p>Here are the details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MetaMask Grants DAO is an <strong>employee-driven, ConsenSys-funded DAO</strong> that issues grants to developers building impactful experiences within the MetaMask ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Every ConsenSys employee can opt-in to be a <strong>Grants DAO member</strong> with equal voting rights governed by a non-transferable token.</li>\n<li>The DAO is made up of two main parts:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employee-Led DAO:</strong> Heart of the DAO made up of all ConsenSys employees.</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership Committee (mini-DAO):</strong> Head of the DAO made up of 7 individuals responsible for finding high-potential projects, creating governance proposals, updating external content, gathering feedback on the DAO, driving improvements to the DAO, and queuing multisig transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The DAO uses a <strong>secure multisig wallet</strong> owned by ConsenSys that will manage the treasury, disbursement of funds, and minting or burning of tokens as employees join or leave the company.</li>\n<li>The DAO will fund two types of grants:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leadership Committee Grants:</strong> Any Leadership Committee member can make a proposal, and <strong>proposals with at least 5 \"yes\" votes at closing will pass.</strong> Leadership Committee grants are intended to provide a quick, easy mechanism for those most closely tied to the grants operations to ensure that high-quality projects that may be overlooked by the full DAO can be funded. Votes will be open for five days and the individual proposing the vote will be responsible for making the case and otherwise taking any actions they need to win the vote’s approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Full DAO Grants:</strong> Any Leadership Committee member can make a proposal to the Full DAO, and <strong>proposals with a simple majority “yes” at closing will pass.</strong> Votes will be open for ten days and the individual proposing the vote will be responsible for making the case and otherwise taking any actions they need to win the vote’s approval.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Grants DAO has a budget of <strong>$600,000 per quarter</strong> to fund meaningful projects.</li>\n<li>Voting and proposals will take place publicly through <strong>SnapShot</strong> on the Codefi Activate platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that’s the tea.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to learn more about this, more details are available here on the <a href=\"https://metamaskgrants.org/\">MetaMask Grants DAO</a> page.</p>\n<p>And finally, have you participated in one of our dev-focused workshops or hackathons? Met our team at a conference and got inspired to tinker around with Snaps? Want to bring your features and APIs to the wallet? Well, here’s your chance. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU-lqYv-F8mmbClf7Ib8k4BEsYceItxDB2FnY3VGma1DqhHg/viewform?usp=sf_link\">Apply for a grant</a> to build out this ecosystem with us.</p>\n<p>*We can’t guarantee when we will review your request or that it will get approved, but know that our team will review the application pipeline as often as we can. Thanks for being patient with us. *</p>\n<p>Beyond the amazing projects we hope to fund with the DAO, Grants DAO is an opportunity for us to experiment with and learn from governance models to influence the direction of future projects.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, MoonPay.</strong></p>\n<p>MoonPay is a leading crypto company that lets users buy and sell digital assets directly with their MetaMask wallet. Since MoonPay’s partnership with MetaMask began in 2022, we’ve been dedicated to simplifying the management of cryptocurrencies, while keeping users secure. Let’s dive into the ways our collaboration achieves this.</p>\n<h2>Streamlining DeFi onboarding</h2>\n<p>As the demand for self-custodial wallets has risen, so too has the need for robust and intuitive tools that give users a frictionless “web2-like” experience. In the past, the two haven’t always mixed well. Newcomers to crypto, who typically have the highest appetite for intuitive UX, tend to find DeFi overly complex.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this tension, MoonPay saw an opportunity to bridge-the-gap by providing seamless cash-to-crypto onboarding to the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, MetaMask. Integrating with MoonPay allowed MetaMask’s millions of users to interface with DeFi through familiar payment options like credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. It also allowed MetaMask users to benefit from MoonPay’s stringent security protocols.</p>\n<h2>Simplifying ramps to protect users</h2>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the integration is that users can purchase digital assets directly within MetaMask wallet — eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms. This approach smoothes out the process, while keeping users’ information safe. By avoiding unnecessary third-party platforms, data exposure is minimized.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing exposure by helping users stay within the platform, MoonPay is committed to protection and security in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ramps are built with advanced encryption technology like AES-256.</li>\n<li>We comply with PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 standards, ensuring we meet stringent data security criteria.</li>\n<li>Our systems have undergone independent audits for PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001/27018, and SOC2 Type 2 certifications, giving users peace of mind that our safety standards don’t waver.</li>\n<li>Our rigorous Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies helps prevent bad actors from entering our ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating a more secure web3</h2>\n<p>As we continue to work alongside MetaMask, our shared focus on safe, user-friendly solutions remains a cornerstone of this partnership. Together, we’re not only simplifying crypto onboarding for newcomers – we’re setting the bar for what it means to prioritize security in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and selling crypto with your MetaMask wallet via MoonPay has never been easier.
