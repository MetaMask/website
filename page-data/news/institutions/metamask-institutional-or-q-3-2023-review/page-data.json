Time can and should be considered a powerful ally that product teams have. Like wind within sails, it can be harnessed to create focus and urgency. It can be used for continuous discovery, learning and iteration. Within product experiences, time is also a crucial element. Reducing latency is one (of many) critical components in delighting users. Time, therefore, is ever-present.</p>\n<p>Within MMI, our focus is always to lean into this power of time. We focus on building features and products as fast as humanly possible. We focus on reducing latency to delight our users. The third quarter was mostly dedicated to this theme – a quarter where we increased the speed of our products, allowed our users to harness the power of crypto rails for payments and reduced the time (engineering hours) it takes to make our products great.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe” – Simon Sinek</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MMI’s vision is to bridge every organisation into web3. We believe web3 will have colossal influence on the world, especially finance, and we focus on providing unrivalled access to this technology. Empowering organisations to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets across three core product experiences (i) via the MMI Extension, which facilitates access to the long tail of permissionless innovation (ii) via the Portfolio Dashboard, a curated web3 read-and-write tool (iii) programmatically via our SDK and APIs. We build these experiences for our core users who are on-chain traders, inventors and builders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Move fast. Speed is one of your main advantages over large competitors.”  – Sam Altman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Growth</h1>\n<p>Despite the muted institutional on-chain activity in the last quarter, we saw meaningful assets deployed using MMI. The average monthly valuation of accounts connected to MMI increased 41.79% in Q3 compared with Q2, while our revenue increased 8% quarter-over-quarter. A trend that we are incredibly excited by is the increased on-chain activity we are seeing within Latin America. Historically, this region made up a small amount of our new onboarded organisations. However, since Q2, we have seen a meaningful increase in signed organisations. Today, some of the largest organisations in the region are using MMI to access web3.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<p>Historically, MMI was a fork of MetaMask, meaning we updated the MMI Extension with the latest changes in MetaMask. In Q3, we completed an initiative we had been working on for the last six months, of merging MMI’s codebase into MetaMask. MMI and MetaMask are now one and the same. With this merge, we rolled out a new and improved user interface (UI). MMI’s user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) will continue to change materially in the quarter ahead as we build tailored experiences for our users. The MMI Extension continues to see exceptionally high engagement and retention. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">Mixpanel’s benchmark and data</a> show average web and mobile applications average eight-week retention rates below 20%. The MMI Extension retention rates are consistently more than 3X these rates.</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<p>Our quarter was dedicated to latency and dependency. We re-architected the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, removed APIs and built new ones. We improved our user onboarding experience, reducing onboarding times six-fold. We also reduced latency across the product 16X, making the experience faster and more delightful for our users. Lastly, we rolled our Crypto Payments as the default payment method, removing dependency on traditional, inefficient, slow payment rails.</p>\n<h1>DeFi Services</h1>\n<p>Our DeFi services teams build rich data services to power the MMI Portfolio Dashboard and other Consensys experiences. Historically, we have built DeFi adapters to provide in-depth DeFi data, from valuations to profit and loss, performance, total value locked, annual percentage rate and annual percentage yield. In Q3, we moved to open-source this work to benefit the broader ecosystem. The team has focused on making the developer experience exceptional. This means any DeFi Protocol engineer can spend less than four hours building a DeFi adapter that will power the MMI portfolio dashboard (or any client that uses the open-source adapters library).</p>\n<h1>Execution</h1>\n<p>In Q3, we enabled tiered fees and withdrawals in the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\">MMI Staking marketplace</a>. We also added <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-partners-with-figment-on-institutional-staking/\">Figment to our list of partners</a> in providing staking infrastructure. The MMI marketplace now offers the most choice, the lowest fees and (we would say) the very best reporting compared to any institutional staking platform.</p>\n<h1>Q4</h1>\n<p>Our focus in Q4 will be to launch a suite of updated features. We believe reporting remains an essential and underserved need within institutional crypto. We have a range of advanced features that we will ship over the next 90 days. We will also empower our users with more APIs. Lastly, we have some exciting public announcements coming out throughout the quarter. As always, we’ll continue to focus on delighting our users by shipping the best features as fast as we possibly can.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore

Mobile, enhancing security of users’ digital assets. By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked.

Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities.
