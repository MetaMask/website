For fund managers, it’s more than just managing LPs’ funds and crafting killer strategies; it's also about meticulously tracking positions and ensuring precise P&#x26;L calculations. The ability to monitor allocations and performance can make or break a fund. Fund admins must reconcile portfolios accurately for their clients, while custodians are tasked with presenting a detailed overview of AUC, tokens, and positions.</p>\n<p>Accurate crypto data is crucial for this. Thanks to the emergence of many RPC and API providers over the past years, we no longer need to run clients and write command lines to get human-readable data from the blockchain. However, very few cater to the specific needs of organizations like funds, fund admins, treasuries, and CEXs that need to fetch and present complex data and information. For instance, if you are a fund running leveraged yield farming strategies across different protocols and chains, simply seeing the balance of the LP token received from a liquidity pool isn't very helpful when it comes to understanding the P&#x26;L of the position and the overall portfolio.</p>\n<h1>The Scalability Challenge</h1>\n<p>The existing approaches also struggle with scalability issues as providers have to constantly play catch-up with the market. Unlike TradFi, where everything is standardized and slow to change, the crypto market is a fast-changing landscape—new tokens, chains, and protocols are created daily, and new trends emerge every few months. For example, restaking, liquid re-staking, and point farming are new trends that have only emerged in the current bull cycle. Consequently, many funds and businesses revert to good old Excel spreadsheets when other solutions fall short. But manual processes eat up time and are prone to errors, especially when you are managing multiple custody/trading accounts across multiple chains.</p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the financial industry, eliminating inefficiencies in the system—there must be a better way to gather and read crypto data than hours of Excel marathons!</p>\n<h1>Enter the MetaMask Institutional (MMI) Reporting API</h1>\n<p>MMI is dedicated to onboarding all organizations on planet Earth to Web3. In order to achieve this mission, we are committed to solving the difficult challenges presented in the space to enable a delightful and frictionless user experience for enterprises.</p>\n<p>In our quest to simplify reading crypto data, apart from providing API access that retrieves basic information such as an <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/everything-you-need-to-know-about-metamask-institutionals-apis/\">overview of token, NFT balance, Defi positions</a>, we’ve launched APIs that cater to the specific reporting needs of enterprises that no one else in the space can offer. They include our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/\">Defi P&#x26;L and performance APIs</a>. The DeFi P&#x26;L and performance APIs are particularly unique as they are powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters\">MMI DeFi adapters</a> developed by the protocols themselves. The notion behind these adapters is to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/mmis-defi-adapters-are-powering-the-future-of-defi/\">solve the scalability issue</a> that was discussed earlier in this blog.</p>\n<p>Just like how ERC20 became an industry standard for utility tokens to make it easier for various platforms and protocols to integrate, MMI aims to define a standard for fetching data and interacting with various DeFi protocols, which often have unique interfaces and data structures. Instead of having the engineers to play the never ending catch-up with the crypto market, protocols/builders contribute to our Defi data standard by building adapters. An adapter aims to accomplish two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetch and transform underlying protocol data into a standardized format that can be easily used by portfolio dashboards.</li>\n<li>Generate transaction parameters to create and update protocol positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How Can Different Organizations Benefit?</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Crypto Funds</strong>\nAutomate your reporting and operations. Instead of wasting hours logging into different platforms, taking screenshots, and feeding data manually into Excel that is prone to human error, let our APIs do the heavy lifting, as your time is valuable.\n<a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">Click here</a> for an example of a daily valuation statement powered by our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot feature</a>, and it’s also <a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">available via API</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Crypto Fund Admins</strong>\nWhy hire additional headcount for manual Excel work when you can <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/#tag/Account\">leverage our APIs to automate portfolio reconciliation</a> for your clients? An automated approach enhances data accuracy and efficiency, thereby boosting customer satisfaction and retention. Also, with more efficient processes, your business can take on more clients, scale and generate more revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Custodians</strong>\nGo beyond presenting accurate AUC, token, and position overviews. Stand out from the competition by offering advanced and granular reporting functions. For instance, provide a detailed breakdown of the underlying assets that make up an LP token, including respective balances and P&#x26;L (see below example). This kind of transparency can set you apart in a crowded market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4mEtdpvvbL9p6mwTZawEY5/e134b1b23f0a979af249f54126fd2feb/MMI-API_Blog-1.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-1\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. Web3 Neo Banks, Wallets, and Dashboard Providers</strong>\nBe the pioneer in your region by offering premium Web3 reporting functions. Become the go-to platform, allowing users to check their crypto balances across all of their wallet addresses (e.g. MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Safe), providing a holistic view instead of just their holdings on your platform to increase stickiness. Or imagine offering internet banking-like features such as daily valuation statements to drive user engagement.\nEssentially you can build and whitelist all the features below (see screenshots) via the MMI API set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7Eu0RDtphC3L3lvfKC4NUr/954e1df2905993304e3092115e2514ad/MMI-API_Blog-2.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-2\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6JEotXh3Q08c0orIOf7g85/e44b49b9ea66f14764a1bc7f4c9e3dee/MMI-API_Blog-3.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-3\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3oJuBw1k3tY52Xg9ESU8iY/3cca5d058b29ad3b619b1e793fbd7a7f/MMI-API_Blog-4.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-4\"></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>To truly drive blockchain adoption and create widely-used DeFi killer apps, we must simplify the process for enterprises to read and integrate DeFi data.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<p>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<p>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<p>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<p>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.\nKey Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
