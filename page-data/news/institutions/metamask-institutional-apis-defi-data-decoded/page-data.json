For fund managers, it’s more than just managing LPs’ funds and crafting killer strategies; it's also about meticulously tracking positions and ensuring precise P&#x26;L calculations. The ability to monitor allocations and performance can make or break a fund. Fund admins must reconcile portfolios accurately for their clients, while custodians are tasked with presenting a detailed overview of AUC, tokens, and positions.</p>\n<p>Accurate crypto data is crucial for this. Thanks to the emergence of many RPC and API providers over the past years, we no longer need to run clients and write command lines to get human-readable data from the blockchain. However, very few cater to the specific needs of organizations like funds, fund admins, treasuries, and CEXs that need to fetch and present complex data and information. For instance, if you are a fund running leveraged yield farming strategies across different protocols and chains, simply seeing the balance of the LP token received from a liquidity pool isn't very helpful when it comes to understanding the P&#x26;L of the position and the overall portfolio.</p>\n<h1>The Scalability Challenge</h1>\n<p>The existing approaches also struggle with scalability issues as providers have to constantly play catch-up with the market. Unlike TradFi, where everything is standardized and slow to change, the crypto market is a fast-changing landscape—new tokens, chains, and protocols are created daily, and new trends emerge every few months. For example, restaking, liquid re-staking, and point farming are new trends that have only emerged in the current bull cycle. Consequently, many funds and businesses revert to good old Excel spreadsheets when other solutions fall short. But manual processes eat up time and are prone to errors, especially when you are managing multiple custody/trading accounts across multiple chains.</p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the financial industry, eliminating inefficiencies in the system—there must be a better way to gather and read crypto data than hours of Excel marathons!</p>\n<h1>Enter the MetaMask Institutional (MMI) Reporting API</h1>\n<p>MMI is dedicated to onboarding all organizations on planet Earth to Web3. In order to achieve this mission, we are committed to solving the difficult challenges presented in the space to enable a delightful and frictionless user experience for enterprises.</p>\n<p>In our quest to simplify reading crypto data, apart from providing API access that retrieves basic information such as an <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/everything-you-need-to-know-about-metamask-institutionals-apis/\">overview of token, NFT balance, Defi positions</a>, we’ve launched APIs that cater to the specific reporting needs of enterprises that no one else in the space can offer. They include our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/\">Defi P&#x26;L and performance APIs</a>. The DeFi P&#x26;L and performance APIs are particularly unique as they are powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters\">MMI DeFi adapters</a> developed by the protocols themselves. The notion behind these adapters is to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/mmis-defi-adapters-are-powering-the-future-of-defi/\">solve the scalability issue</a> that was discussed earlier in this blog.</p>\n<p>Just like how ERC20 became an industry standard for utility tokens to make it easier for various platforms and protocols to integrate, MMI aims to define a standard for fetching data and interacting with various DeFi protocols, which often have unique interfaces and data structures. Instead of having the engineers to play the never ending catch-up with the crypto market, protocols/builders contribute to our Defi data standard by building adapters. An adapter aims to accomplish two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetch and transform underlying protocol data into a standardized format that can be easily used by portfolio dashboards.</li>\n<li>Generate transaction parameters to create and update protocol positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How Can Different Organizations Benefit?</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Crypto Funds</strong>\nAutomate your reporting and operations. Instead of wasting hours logging into different platforms, taking screenshots, and feeding data manually into Excel that is prone to human error, let our APIs do the heavy lifting, as your time is valuable.\n<a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">Click here</a> for an example of a daily valuation statement powered by our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot feature</a>, and it’s also <a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">available via API</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Crypto Fund Admins</strong>\nWhy hire additional headcount for manual Excel work when you can <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/#tag/Account\">leverage our APIs to automate portfolio reconciliation</a> for your clients? An automated approach enhances data accuracy and efficiency, thereby boosting customer satisfaction and retention. Also, with more efficient processes, your business can take on more clients, scale and generate more revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Custodians</strong>\nGo beyond presenting accurate AUC, token, and position overviews. Stand out from the competition by offering advanced and granular reporting functions. For instance, provide a detailed breakdown of the underlying assets that make up an LP token, including respective balances and P&#x26;L (see below example). This kind of transparency can set you apart in a crowded market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4mEtdpvvbL9p6mwTZawEY5/e134b1b23f0a979af249f54126fd2feb/MMI-API_Blog-1.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-1\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. Web3 Neo Banks, Wallets, and Dashboard Providers</strong>\nBe the pioneer in your region by offering premium Web3 reporting functions. Become the go-to platform, allowing users to check their crypto balances across all of their wallet addresses (e.g. MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Safe), providing a holistic view instead of just their holdings on your platform to increase stickiness. Or imagine offering internet banking-like features such as daily valuation statements to drive user engagement.\nEssentially you can build and whitelist all the features below (see screenshots) via the MMI API set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7Eu0RDtphC3L3lvfKC4NUr/954e1df2905993304e3092115e2514ad/MMI-API_Blog-2.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-2\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6JEotXh3Q08c0orIOf7g85/e44b49b9ea66f14764a1bc7f4c9e3dee/MMI-API_Blog-3.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-3\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3oJuBw1k3tY52Xg9ESU8iY/3cca5d058b29ad3b619b1e793fbd7a7f/MMI-API_Blog-4.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-4\"></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>To truly drive blockchain adoption and create widely-used DeFi killer apps, we must simplify the process for enterprises to read and integrate DeFi data.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
