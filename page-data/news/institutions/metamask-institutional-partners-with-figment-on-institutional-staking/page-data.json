This partnership will expand MMI’s institutional staking marketplace, which launched in March 2023.</p>\n<p>The addition of Figment to MMI’s staking marketplace brings MMI’s offering to five aggregated institutional staking providers, alongside Consensys Staking, and three others. With this decentralized approach, MMI offers institutions the choice among the industry's top tier providers, together with standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting, and a simplified staking experience. MMI’s institutional staking marketplace brings a unique and enhanced staking experience to all kinds of organizations seeking to engage in Web3.</p>\n<p>Before we dive deeper into the Figment-MMI partnership, let’s recap why staking is crucial for Ethereum, and how institutions stake.</p>\n<h2>Institutions and Staking</h2>\n<p>Staking was a core component of Ethereum’s move to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, away from the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, in September last year.</p>\n<p>Staking entails depositing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toghrulmaharram/status/1530708903440302082\">32 ETH</a> to activate another validator, or node, to the network. These validators play a crucial role in achieving consensus by proposing new blocks, and verifying and attesting to the validity of other proposed blocks. As the number of <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md\">honest validators</a> increases, the cost of attacking the network rises, significantly enhancing Ethereum's economic security.</p>\n<p>Ethereum’s upgrade to PoS brought numerous advantages, enhancing settlement <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#finality\">finality</a> guarantees, enabling <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/\">sharding</a>, and significantly reducing <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/\">ETH issuance</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/\">energy usage</a>. From the standpoint of an Ethereum user, this transition also opened up a fresh avenue for earning additional token rewards through <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/staking/#:~:text=Further%20reading-,What%20is%20staking%3F,new%20ETH%20in%20the%20process\">staking</a>.</p>\n<p>Staking can be an integral part of an institution’s digital asset strategy, especially since the Shanghai/Capella upgrade earlier this year. This upgrade enabled withdrawals of the ETH that had been locked on Ethereum’s consensus layer since December 2020, when staking was first enabled on the Beacon chain.</p>\n<p>However, the nuances and complexity of institutional staking can deter companies looking to participate. Choosing the right vendor for institutional staking can be complicated due to the differences in the fees charged, slashing coverage, infrastructure, terms and conditions,  and reporting standards. In addition, various staking providers offer different benefits to institutions, ranging from differences in infrastructure (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client) to certifications (SOC2 Type 2 and ISO 27001).</p>\n<p>Institutions often want to select their node locations too. This can help them comply with the regulations of the jurisdiction their nodes are in, and ensure the network is decentralized by choosing diverse node locations, among other things.</p>\n<p>MMI’s institutional staking marketplace is aimed at streamlining this complex staking experience for institutions and leveling the playing field by bringing together best-in-class partners to provide institutions with a simple one-click staking experience.</p>\n<h2>MMI Staking Marketplace</h2>\n<p>MMI’s staking marketplace provides access to top-tier staking providers; offers standardized terms and conditions, institutional-grade reporting; and a simplified staking experience—to facilitate broader institutional web3 participation.</p>\n<p>Institutions often require multiple custodial integrations to engage in web3, depending on their regulatory requirements, and security and privacy needs. It also means institutions are bound by the provider their custodian has chosen. However, MetaMask Institutional today <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">is integrated</a> with 12 custody and self-custody platforms globally. This allows institutions seamless and unrivaled access to staking providers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">MMI</a>, the web3 wallet for organizations developed by Consensys, and the first multi-custodial institutional web3 offering on the market, is excited to include <a href=\"http://figment.io\">Figment</a> in our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/?utm_source=consensys&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=figment_announcement\">institutional staking marketplace</a>.</p>\n<h2>Figment and MMI</h2>\n<p>Figment is the leading provider of staking infrastructure with over $3B in total assets staked.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?
