In the world of crypto, we add the principles of permissionless innovation, open-source technology, and <a href=\"https://www.christenseninstitute.org/interdependence-modularity/\">modularity theory</a> (to name only a few), resulting in innovation cycles that are arguably second to none. These tides, currents and waves come to mind as I reflect on the first quarter of the year.</p>\n<p>In a recent conversation with a famous VC and crypto fund, they expressed their amazement at how quickly exuberant valuations had returned and how ebullient the ecosystem was from a mere quarter ago. \"We are so back\" was an often observed phrase across the ecosystem in Q1. As a perfect testament to this acceleration, memecoins have undergone a \"tik-tok'ifcation\" this cycle, compressing into lasting only a few days, hours or even minutes. Yet <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/hedge-funds-lured-by-returns-of-memecoins-like-dogwifhat-wif?embedded-checkout=true\">attracting seasoned investors who need and want to participate</a>.</p>\n<p>It's not surprising that this abundance of innovation presents remarkable opportunities. Given tokenomics and values and principles that rebuke inflationary assets (in distribution, not in price), being early in crypto can be rewarding. This is why, since the Cambrian explosion started during the DeFi summer, organisations have needed and wanted access. First slowly, then all at once, each cycle draws more adoption from consumers and institutions alike. Hence, organisations don't just need access; they need unrivalled access.</p>\n<p>At MetaMask Institutional, our core belief is centred around this concept of unrivalled access. We are convinced that organisations, regardless of their structure or location, will need to engage with the new internet, web3, through various product experiences. This could be at the forefront of web3 innovation, a curated interface, or programmatically.</p>\n<p>At MMI, we adhere to stringent product principles that guide us in creating experiences from zero to one and from one to many. Our first principles revolve around providing unrivalled web3 access and empowering institutions to oversee, manage, control, and report on their web3 assets, regardless of their required interface. These principles drive the three value streams we have established: the MMI Extension, which enables secure access to the long tail of permissionless innovation within web3; the Portfolio Dashboard, a curated web3 read-and-write institutional experience; and our SDK and APIs for unrivalled programmatic access. With these products and first principles, we shape our product strategies to address the most critical user needs (tier-1) for our users. Our strategies encompass many areas, from creating delightful user experiences and seamless control to unrivalled reporting on any asset, anywhere.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on Q1, perhaps one strategy perfectly summarises our focus to solve the fundamental user need for unrivalled access: \"Any asset, anywhere\". To stand in accord with the rapid innovation within the ecosystem, Q1 was a prodigious quarter for the MMI team.</p>\n<h1>Growth</h1>\n<h3><em>“Much effort, much prosperity.”— Euripedes</em></h3>\n<p>In Q2, MMI grew 70.83% quarter-over-quarter with newly signed and activated organisations. This growth was driven by 81.82% in North America and Europe, 88.89% in APAC and MENA and 59.17% in LATAM.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<h3><em>“The value is in what gets used, not in what gets built”. – Kris Gale</em></h3>\n<p>The MMI extension provides connectivity to all of web3, most notably the frontier of web3. In Q1 2024, our strategy was focused on delighting our users with improved user experience. Our goal is to give users access to the long tail of permissionless innovation with an experience that offers enterprise-grade security and stability.  Our goal has been to build a valuable product for our users as measured by engagement and retention. The MMI extension has an 8-week retention rate of 63.68% and a weekly over-monthly transacting user engagement ratio of 0.616. <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/blog/whats-a-good-retention-rate/\">Mixpanel’s benchmark data</a> shows that the average retention rates of web and mobile applications are eight weeks below 20%. At the same time, Sequoia Capital <a href=\"https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/selecting-the-right-user-metric-de95015aa38\">indicates just how high our engagement metric is</a>.</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<h3><em>“I want it all and I want it now” — Queen</em></h3>\n<p>A product principle within our team is to spend time with our users daily. From these sessions, we have consistently heard a repeating pain point. That no product in the market today shows them everything. Given the fast innovation cycles in new Layer 1 and Layer 2’s across EVM and Non-EVM networks, users are still required to track and report on their positions manually. Accordingly, our Q1 strategy was focused on any asset anywhere, layering in different initiatives and epics to empower users to consolidate all their holdings. Within our tactics, we first shipped account management within the Portfolio Dashboard, focusing on offering a delightful user experience. Firstly, we automatically detect any accounts any user in an organisation has transacted with and then automatically add it to their organisation. Secondly, if we detect a new account in the MMI extension that is not already part of an organisation, we ask the user if they would like to add any of these accounts to their organisation. Lastly, users can now enter any account for their organisation by navigating to the Accounts section in the portfolio dashboard. Any EVM accounts added to an organisation will be shown within the transaction history view. We show the transaction history from the inception of an address. Lastly, any accounts added to an organisation will be snapshot daily, providing detailed validation statements. Our strategy here is to offer seamless control.</p>\n<p>Our next tactic was to integrate Solana support, a process that now allows users to add a Solana account with just a few clicks. Solana accounts and tokens are seamlessly integrated into the Assets section of the Portfolio Dashboard and added to Snapshots. Our last tactic focused on implementing support for Centralised Exchange data. With our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/your-cefi-data-and-positions-now-available-on-metamask-institutional-in/\">Mesh integration</a>, we launched with support for Coinbase Prime and will soon add more Prime and Institutional account support. Users can now connect their prime accounts, view their token balances within the Portfolio Dashboard, and get snapshot valuations of all their on-chain and off-chain holdings.</p>\n<p>Our ultimate goal is to build a curated, institutional product that our users can’t live without. We measure the value we provide through engagement and retention metrics. Our 8-week retention for the portfolio dashboard since inception is 49.63%, more than double the average for mobile and web applications. This success is a testament to our shared vision and the value we deliver to our users.</p>\n<h1>DeFi open source adapter</h1>\n<h3><em>“Thunderbolts and lightning” — Queen</em></h3>\n<p>As permissionless innovation has expanded the depth and breadth of DeFi protocols, our users have increasingly needed accurate DeFi data. Over the last two years, we have spent 10,000 hours in the DeFi data trenches, building simulators to simulate closing positions and the value of the underlying tokens, and speaking with the consumers and producers of DeFi data. From this, we have consistently heard the same repeating challenges. Namely, users who need accurate DeFi positions and those with DeFi protocols who need and want users to interact with their protocols. In conjunction with this race for data in a world of permissionless innovation, we also found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DeFi protocols were not being connected with users at scale</li>\n<li>There is no standard for both read and write DeFi access</li>\n<li>Few scaled approaches benefit the wider ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, we set out to build a DeFi adapter standard that is focused on achieving the following goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide a standardised adapter implementation specification for both read and write data. We want to enable any protocol engineer to build an adapter in less than four hours.</li>\n<li>Provide rich and in-depth DeFi data. We resolve an LP token into the underlying token exposure to value a position. We also offer proper time-weighted profit &#x26; loss (P&#x26;L) and return data, therefore accounting for inflows and outflows, claimed and unclaimed rewards to arrive at the correct P&#x26;L and performance position.</li>\n<li>Benefit the wider ecosystem. We want to create an open-source standard that benefits consumers of the data, drives users to DeFi protocols and allows anyone to fork and use the repository.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This work ties in with our strategies of any asset anywhere and unrivalled programmatic access, and we delight our users with industry-leading rich and in-depth data.

You can expect to see improved user experiences, a continuation of features that offer seamless control and unrivalled reporting to users. Q2 is also filled with conferences, and we look forward to spending time with our new, existing and potential users.</p>\n<p><img

crypto ecosystem. Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked. As MetaMask’s phishing detection provider, <a href=\"https://chainpatrol.io/\">ChainPatrol</a> recognized the power of a blocklist approach early on.</p>\n<p>While traditional takedowns are still important, in the worst cases it can take over a day to remove a phishing site entirely. MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1H51TkYG1NHQHa0K9CHsNT/e983121c477c4cde79958c93baaab5be/MetaMask_takedown_time.jpg\" alt=\"MetaMask takedown time\"></p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis. By addressing these threats with speed, users are protected from having their data and wallets compromised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52fcYS0XoMmzrMcPClmA2n/5d826b2547e5e1822f9965016b822080/MetaMask_Threats_Blocked_By_Day_.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Threats Blocked By Day\"></p>\n<p><em>In 2024, ChainPatrol blocked over 29,000 threats targeting Consensys brands including Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
