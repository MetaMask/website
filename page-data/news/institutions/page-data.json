Flexibility is the freedom to access the ever-evolving landscape of networks and tokens. It also means the freedom to customize an organization-wide interface in a way that promotes usability and intra-organizational collaboration.</p>\n<p>At the same time, digital assets must be protected from malicious front-end attacks and through established private key management. Snaps are designed to empower institutions with customizable features that offer the best of both worlds—all from the most battle-tested wallet.</p>\n<h1>What are Snaps?</h1>\n<p>Snaps are applications that allow users to safely extend the functionality of MetaMask and MetaMask Institutional, creating new web3 end-user experiences. For example, a Snap can add support for different blockchain networks, add custom account types, or provide additional functionality using its own APIs. These applications open up innovation to the wider community of Web3 builders where users are no longer constrained or dependent on a single organization to develop features or build out connectivity. Snaps are built by the wider Web3 community, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/navigating-the-security-landscape-of-metamask-snaps/\">under security standards set by Consensys</a>, and audited by <a href=\"https://consensys.io/diligence/\">Consensys Diligence</a> and other trusted audit companies.</p>\n<h3>What kind of Snaps can institutional users leverage to improve their DeFi experience?</h3>\n<p>Snaps can do a lot, including providing insights about transactions, displaying notifications, enabling new identity and privacy solutions, and even connecting to blockchains beyond Ethereum. The following are a few categories and examples of useful Snaps in the context of Institutional Web3 users.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Security</strong> - For institutions, security is at the top of their minds in the context of risk management. While custody tech providers offer great tools for managing private keys, site front-ends, smart contracts, and wallet-level permissions remain attack vectors. Moreover, security takes a village - with different providers specializing in different aspects of security. With snaps, you can add multiple security frameworks and choose your own preferred solution. Highlights include Walletguard, Web3 Antivirus, and Hashdit security Snaps which can provide real-time risk warnings of interacting with certain malicious front-ends and smart contracts through transaction simulations and human-readable transaction summaries.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Notifications</strong> - As more of our digital lives move on-chain, institutional users spend more time plugged into wallet-level interfaces like MetaMask Institutional. Managing digital assets on behalf of clients means managing a variety of protocols related to RWA’s, stablecoins, NFTs, and social channels. Snaps like Push, Web3 MQ, and L3MBDA Alerts allow users to choose parameters, such as a token transfer in a DeFi Dapp or a message on a Web3 social app. When the parameter is fulfilled, a notification arrives in the wallet. This means institutional users can stay aware of changes in the Web3 ecosystem without leaving the wallet or having to change to different protocol UI’s.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Interoperability</strong> - As Web3 grows, so too does the number of different chains (and subsequently the number of different wallet solutions that serve these chains). EVM chains are easy to connect to both <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/\">MetaMask and MetaMask Institutional via custom RPC’s</a>. Non-EVM presents a challenge to wallet providers, with lengthy manual integrations for new chains. The Snaps platform pioneered a decentralized approach, where chain and wallet builders can contribute a Snap that extends MetaMask functionality to new chains. Popular Snaps include Solflare (Solana chain), Leap (Cosmos chain), and Shapeshift (multiple chains). For institutional users, these Snaps are best used with the MetaMask Institutional SRP accounts (accounts derived from the secret recovery phrase in MMI) as we work with custody tech partners to enable this functionality with integrated custody tech accounts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5LPBH4FPXyM7zFeZAM7IM7/d92a11e9670020fcf16f826be2e3558d/Screenshot_2024-09-05_at_18.50.07.png\" alt=\"mmi-snaps-blog-directory\"></p>\n<h1>The future of DeFi is permissionless innovation</h1>\n<p>As the DeFi landscape continues to expand, institutional user needs will grow more complicated and distinctive based on specialized roles. This will require additional flexibility from DeFi infrastructure, without sacrificing security.  By offering customizability through permissionless innovation, Snaps can help meet the rigorous demands of professional traders, builders, and investors - making it easier than ever to navigate the complexities of the crypto world.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"42Oc67FYvZooa77w8768MD","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional | Q2 2024 Review","slug":"metamask-institutional-or-q2-2024-review","subtitle":"MetaMask Institutional (MMI) dedicated its Q2 to continued rapid innovation within our three product experiences.

I hope Titus Livy’s famous quote: “better late than never” duly applies. The second quarter of 2024 starkly juxtaposed Q1 regarding institutional on-chain activity. Thus far, this bull cycle has been in stark contrast to the previous cycle’s Cambrian application explosion. Accordingly, we have seen far fewer crypto fund formations and hear of Crypto VCs struggling to deploy capital. With the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, we have seen more traditional organisation adoption, and hence, interestingly, our fastest growing user segment has been organisations building on-chain.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) dedicated its Q2 to continued rapid innovation within our three product experiences. We tend to apply Marc Andreessen’s “It’s time to build” continually. We add more network coverage every quarter, increasing our uptimes and reducing our latency.</p>\n<h1>Extension &#x26; Integrations</h1>\n<h3><em>“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” – Albert Einstein</em></h3>\n<p>The MMI extension provides connectivity to all of web3, most notably the frontier of web3. There are many web3 connectors and an increasing handful of institutional options. MMI offers the most comprehensive access to web3 connectivity and institutional key management options. MMI is the only multi-custodial wallet that exists. We also provide enterprise-grade uptimes, reliability and consistency, and the industry's best customer support. We dedicated Q2 to our unwavering reliability strategy. We shipped a range of updates to ensure our users' highest uptimes and reliability. We also shipped user experience improvements, from improved settings to custodian connectivity via QR scanning (reducing latency to account importing).</p>\n<h1>Portfolio Dashboard</h1>\n<h3><em>“Price is what you pay, value is what you get” – Warren Buffet</em></h3>\n<p>Our portfolio dashboard is a curated web3 read (view) and write (execution) institutional tool. Its sole focus is to empower an organisation to monitor, manage, control and report on all their crypto assets. We support all EVMs, Solana, Bitcoin and centralised exchange data. Our on-chain data shows detailed time-weighted profit and loss (P&#x26;L) and performance metrics. We offer <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">snapshot valuations</a>, where organisations can choose the exact time of day they want to value their assets. An organisation can consume, analyse, view and share these valuations via a read-only <a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">UI</a>, CSV or API.</p>\n<p>We dedicated our quarter to three main initiatives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In our focus on showing an organisation any asset, we added further centralised exchange data coverage anywhere with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g6w5_JbNYVU\">Binance and OKX integrations</a>.

Along with this change, we shipped a delightful user experience for users to view, download and pay their monthly invoices (in crypto and Fiat) from the portfolio dashboard.</p>\n<h1>APIs</h1>\n<h3><em>“You want your customers to value your service” – Jeff Bezos</em></h3>\n<p>In Q2, we launched our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-apis-for-institutions/\">API suite</a> to empower organisations programmatically to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets. Today, we offer valuations, transaction history and detailed DeFi positions. In Q2, we added centralised exchange data to our API suite. We also improved latency and data freshness for our users.</p>\n<h1>Q3 2024</h1>\n<h3><em>“Forget goals. Value the process.” – Jim Bouton</em></h3>\n<p>In Q3, we will launch a series of new features to give further crypto access. Empowering organisations with the ability to monitor, manage, control and report on positions and also to be able to transact safely and securely.

A critical decision that users have to make is determining the best mode of asset custody—whether to choose a licensed full-custody service, self-custody via MPC providers or multisig smart contracts, or a multi-custody approach to diversify risk and optimize returns.</p>\n<p>However, safeguarding your assets is just the first step. The next challenge is ensuring secure and reliable connections to Web3, especially when managing millions in on-chain transactions. With so many Web3 wallets (connectors) available, choosing the right one can be daunting.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we outline the key factors to consider when evaluating the security of a Web3 wallet, providing a framework that will help institutional investors confidently navigate their journey into DeFi and Web3.</p>\n<h1>Key Considerations:</h1>\n<h4>1.  Security Culture, Audits, and Penetration Testing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engineering Team Expertise:</strong> Assess the experience and expertise of the engineering team. What is their track record, and how deeply do they understand Web3 security?</li>\n<li><strong>Engineering Resources:</strong> How many dedicated resources are allocated to the wallet?

For fund managers, it’s more than just managing LPs’ funds and crafting killer strategies; it's also about meticulously tracking positions and ensuring precise P&#x26;L calculations. The ability to monitor allocations and performance can make or break a fund. Fund admins must reconcile portfolios accurately for their clients, while custodians are tasked with presenting a detailed overview of AUC, tokens, and positions.</p>\n<p>Accurate crypto data is crucial for this. Thanks to the emergence of many RPC and API providers over the past years, we no longer need to run clients and write command lines to get human-readable data from the blockchain. However, very few cater to the specific needs of organizations like funds, fund admins, treasuries, and CEXs that need to fetch and present complex data and information. For instance, if you are a fund running leveraged yield farming strategies across different protocols and chains, simply seeing the balance of the LP token received from a liquidity pool isn't very helpful when it comes to understanding the P&#x26;L of the position and the overall portfolio.</p>\n<h1>The Scalability Challenge</h1>\n<p>The existing approaches also struggle with scalability issues as providers have to constantly play catch-up with the market. Unlike TradFi, where everything is standardized and slow to change, the crypto market is a fast-changing landscape—new tokens, chains, and protocols are created daily, and new trends emerge every few months. For example, restaking, liquid re-staking, and point farming are new trends that have only emerged in the current bull cycle. Consequently, many funds and businesses revert to good old Excel spreadsheets when other solutions fall short. But manual processes eat up time and are prone to errors, especially when you are managing multiple custody/trading accounts across multiple chains.</p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the financial industry, eliminating inefficiencies in the system—there must be a better way to gather and read crypto data than hours of Excel marathons!</p>\n<h1>Enter the MetaMask Institutional (MMI) Reporting API</h1>\n<p>MMI is dedicated to onboarding all organizations on planet Earth to Web3. In order to achieve this mission, we are committed to solving the difficult challenges presented in the space to enable a delightful and frictionless user experience for enterprises.</p>\n<p>In our quest to simplify reading crypto data, apart from providing API access that retrieves basic information such as an <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/everything-you-need-to-know-about-metamask-institutionals-apis/\">overview of token, NFT balance, Defi positions</a>, we’ve launched APIs that cater to the specific reporting needs of enterprises that no one else in the space can offer. They include our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/\">Defi P&#x26;L and performance APIs</a>. The DeFi P&#x26;L and performance APIs are particularly unique as they are powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters\">MMI DeFi adapters</a> developed by the protocols themselves. The notion behind these adapters is to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/mmis-defi-adapters-are-powering-the-future-of-defi/\">solve the scalability issue</a> that was discussed earlier in this blog.</p>\n<p>Just like how ERC20 became an industry standard for utility tokens to make it easier for various platforms and protocols to integrate, MMI aims to define a standard for fetching data and interacting with various DeFi protocols, which often have unique interfaces and data structures. Instead of having the engineers to play the never ending catch-up with the crypto market, protocols/builders contribute to our Defi data standard by building adapters. An adapter aims to accomplish two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetch and transform underlying protocol data into a standardized format that can be easily used by portfolio dashboards.</li>\n<li>Generate transaction parameters to create and update protocol positions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How Can Different Organizations Benefit?</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Crypto Funds</strong>\nAutomate your reporting and operations. Instead of wasting hours logging into different platforms, taking screenshots, and feeding data manually into Excel that is prone to human error, let our APIs do the heavy lifting, as your time is valuable.\n<a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">Click here</a> for an example of a daily valuation statement powered by our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/all-the-latest-on-metamask-institutionals-snapshots/\">Snapshot feature</a>, and it’s also <a href=\"https://dev.metamask-institutional.io/snapshot/org_C7B4TjkcsqmZ9VDj/5c28a925-f3a2-477c-99ff-09cf01a99c4d?currency=usd\">available via API</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Crypto Fund Admins</strong>\nWhy hire additional headcount for manual Excel work when you can <a href=\"https://consensys-vertical-apps.github.io/mmi-api-gateway/docs/#tag/Account\">leverage our APIs to automate portfolio reconciliation</a> for your clients? An automated approach enhances data accuracy and efficiency, thereby boosting customer satisfaction and retention. Also, with more efficient processes, your business can take on more clients, scale and generate more revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Custodians</strong>\nGo beyond presenting accurate AUC, token, and position overviews. Stand out from the competition by offering advanced and granular reporting functions. For instance, provide a detailed breakdown of the underlying assets that make up an LP token, including respective balances and P&#x26;L (see below example). This kind of transparency can set you apart in a crowded market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4mEtdpvvbL9p6mwTZawEY5/e134b1b23f0a979af249f54126fd2feb/MMI-API_Blog-1.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-1\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. Web3 Neo Banks, Wallets, and Dashboard Providers</strong>\nBe the pioneer in your region by offering premium Web3 reporting functions. Become the go-to platform, allowing users to check their crypto balances across all of their wallet addresses (e.g. MetaMask, Ledger, Phantom, Safe), providing a holistic view instead of just their holdings on your platform to increase stickiness. Or imagine offering internet banking-like features such as daily valuation statements to drive user engagement.\nEssentially you can build and whitelist all the features below (see screenshots) via the MMI API set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7Eu0RDtphC3L3lvfKC4NUr/954e1df2905993304e3092115e2514ad/MMI-API_Blog-2.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-2\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6JEotXh3Q08c0orIOf7g85/e44b49b9ea66f14764a1bc7f4c9e3dee/MMI-API_Blog-3.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-3\">\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3oJuBw1k3tY52Xg9ESU8iY/3cca5d058b29ad3b619b1e793fbd7a7f/MMI-API_Blog-4.png\" alt=\"MMI-API Blog-4\"></p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>To truly drive blockchain adoption and create widely-used DeFi killer apps, we must simplify the process for enterprises to read and integrate DeFi data.
