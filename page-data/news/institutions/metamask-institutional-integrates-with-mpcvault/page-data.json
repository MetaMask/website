The major selling point is our non-custodial approach that lets users, rather than MPCVault or any other centralized party, retain complete control over their wallet keys. This is a feature increasingly sought after as centralized wallets lose credibility. The user experience of MPCVault is best-in-class and we have <a href=\"https://github.com/mpcvault/mpcvaultapis/wiki/MPCVault-API-Documentation\">robust APIs</a> our customers can build with.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What specific features or functionalities does MPCVault bring to MMI users?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault is designed to provide a versatile set of key features to help clients better manage their assets. It offers a completely self-driven platform that does not need us for operational management. Users can securely create vaults, wallets, multi-sig policies, new users, API keys, and more through user authentication without interacting with MPCVault.</p>\n<p>MPCVault supports all token types without whitelisting. If a user is minting the latest hot NFT or their own brand-new token, they can see and interact with the token in MPCVault immediately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most attractive is our bank-like transaction history. This feature tracks all your asset movements and breaks out each transaction into its parts in a consolidated view. In a DEX swap, for example, users can view both legs of the swap and the gas payment individually. Users can also add transaction notes pre- and post-transaction to provide context around the transaction across their team. All of this is, of course, exportable to excel and queryable using our API.</p>\n<p>We also provide comprehensive blockchain support, with support for <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/supported-assets\">12 blockchains</a> currently. And we are always looking to support more to align with our customer’s needs. We can support new blockchains more easily than our competitors due to early design decisions. Lastly, but probably most importantly, we have designed the product to be intuitive and reliable. Users reliably receive signing requests and our system processes requests quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What security measures does MPCVault have in place?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault’s architecture eliminates any single point of vulnerability and empowers users to secure their assets in self-custody. any consumer and custodial wallets require just one private, encrypted key to authorize transactions. However, business decisions often involve approvals from multiple parties for internal control, which is exactly what MPCVault allows.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the only wallet solution that utilizes all three major cloud platforms – AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Our multi-cloud approach further reduces the potential for compromises that could occur with a single-cloud provider. The runtime environments are secured with Trusted Execution Environments. MPCVault utilizes AMD's SEV and Intel's SGX to create an orthogonal risk profile and enhance protection for users’ assets by employing encrypted memory, ephemeral cryptography, and remote attestation. To reduce the trust base, all critical components and communications within MPCVault are end-to-end secured using public key pinning.</p>\n<p>Aside from safeguarding keys, an enterprise-facing wallet should also protect client assets in a manner that web2 antivirus software works to protect users from attacks. To that end, MPCVault’s wallet solution comes with a security layer that scans for phishing URLs, detects suspicious behaviour, checks for interacted addresses, and performs semantic analysis and transaction simulation to help users understand what transactions they are signing.</p>\n<p>Finally, MPCVault is SOC 2 Type 2 certified as a vendor for enterprise software. We also undergo regular penetration testing to proactively identify potential risks and implement mitigation measures.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: Now let’s look at how the integration between MMI and MPCVault will bring added advantages and facilitate scalability for users.</strong></p>\n<p>Aligning with MPCVault will offer our users access to an MPC provider, which provides an extensive suite of features at a <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/pricing\">competitive price point</a>. Moreover, MPCVault makes it very simple for users to get started with their free tier.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the first custodian to implement our updated integration standard that now supports broadcasting facilitated by MMI. This fundamental upgrade lets users choose and broadcast through any RPC provider, enabling them to transact on EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<p>In one of the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/unveiling-the-power-of-metamask-snaps-on-mmi/\">latest releases</a>, MMI introduced support for Snaps. With Snaps, the functionalities of the MMI extension can be further enhanced with transaction insight Snaps and notification Snaps. With MPCVault, we take the first step to enable our customers to transact on non-EVM chains. We have initiated the work with MPCVault to build a Cosmos Snap which is a much-requested non-EVM chain support that we are receiving.</p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about MMI and MPCVault’s integration? <strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Click here</a> to schedule a demo!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> is an institution-compliant version of the world’s leading web3 wallet, MetaMask.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Integrate with your hardware wallet:</strong> Enhance your security by connecting MetaMask to hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor from Portfolio, combining the convenience of MetaMask with the robust security of cold storage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Customize privacy settings:</strong> Adjust your privacy settings to your preference, including setting up a custom RPC for specific networks, managing connected sites, and reviewing permissions. Learn more about how to configure your privacy settings <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>9. Participate in staking:</strong> Stake your crypto directly through MetaMask Portfolio, participating in the decision-making processes of various protocols and earning rewards. In Portfolio, there are three options for staking, Validator, Pooled, and <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake?tab=liquid\">Liquid</a>. The below tutorials show you how easy it is to start staking based on your preference.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQRwcnQVsOE?si=ZT1ykhcORwR4DYXl\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHEymH5s97o?si=ahioErY_gO8k3xDx\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>10. Bridge tokens:</strong> Bridging tokens on MetaMask refers to the process of transferring digital assets or tokens from one blockchain network to another using MetaMask as the interface for the transaction. Bridging tokens is a powerful feature in Portfolio that enhances the interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling users to leverage the unique advantages of each network.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1rwvBWk5XU?si=twN-RTUS1qioHW3l\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<h3><strong>Coming soon in Portfolio</strong></h3>\n<br />\n<p>Transfer assets from centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase and Binance directly to your MetaMask wallet, or between different accounts within MetaMask itself, with enhanced security and ease. Stay tuned for this feature coming soon in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> not only simplifies the management of digital assets but also opens up a world of possibilities for users to explore and engage with the decentralized ecosystem, all while maintaining a high level of security and user control.
