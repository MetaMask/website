The major selling point is our non-custodial approach that lets users, rather than MPCVault or any other centralized party, retain complete control over their wallet keys. This is a feature increasingly sought after as centralized wallets lose credibility. The user experience of MPCVault is best-in-class and we have <a href=\"https://github.com/mpcvault/mpcvaultapis/wiki/MPCVault-API-Documentation\">robust APIs</a> our customers can build with.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What specific features or functionalities does MPCVault bring to MMI users?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault is designed to provide a versatile set of key features to help clients better manage their assets. It offers a completely self-driven platform that does not need us for operational management. Users can securely create vaults, wallets, multi-sig policies, new users, API keys, and more through user authentication without interacting with MPCVault.</p>\n<p>MPCVault supports all token types without whitelisting. If a user is minting the latest hot NFT or their own brand-new token, they can see and interact with the token in MPCVault immediately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most attractive is our bank-like transaction history. This feature tracks all your asset movements and breaks out each transaction into its parts in a consolidated view. In a DEX swap, for example, users can view both legs of the swap and the gas payment individually. Users can also add transaction notes pre- and post-transaction to provide context around the transaction across their team. All of this is, of course, exportable to excel and queryable using our API.</p>\n<p>We also provide comprehensive blockchain support, with support for <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/supported-assets\">12 blockchains</a> currently. And we are always looking to support more to align with our customer’s needs. We can support new blockchains more easily than our competitors due to early design decisions. Lastly, but probably most importantly, we have designed the product to be intuitive and reliable. Users reliably receive signing requests and our system processes requests quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What security measures does MPCVault have in place?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault’s architecture eliminates any single point of vulnerability and empowers users to secure their assets in self-custody. any consumer and custodial wallets require just one private, encrypted key to authorize transactions. However, business decisions often involve approvals from multiple parties for internal control, which is exactly what MPCVault allows.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the only wallet solution that utilizes all three major cloud platforms – AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Our multi-cloud approach further reduces the potential for compromises that could occur with a single-cloud provider. The runtime environments are secured with Trusted Execution Environments. MPCVault utilizes AMD's SEV and Intel's SGX to create an orthogonal risk profile and enhance protection for users’ assets by employing encrypted memory, ephemeral cryptography, and remote attestation. To reduce the trust base, all critical components and communications within MPCVault are end-to-end secured using public key pinning.</p>\n<p>Aside from safeguarding keys, an enterprise-facing wallet should also protect client assets in a manner that web2 antivirus software works to protect users from attacks. To that end, MPCVault’s wallet solution comes with a security layer that scans for phishing URLs, detects suspicious behaviour, checks for interacted addresses, and performs semantic analysis and transaction simulation to help users understand what transactions they are signing.</p>\n<p>Finally, MPCVault is SOC 2 Type 2 certified as a vendor for enterprise software. We also undergo regular penetration testing to proactively identify potential risks and implement mitigation measures.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: Now let’s look at how the integration between MMI and MPCVault will bring added advantages and facilitate scalability for users.</strong></p>\n<p>Aligning with MPCVault will offer our users access to an MPC provider, which provides an extensive suite of features at a <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/pricing\">competitive price point</a>. Moreover, MPCVault makes it very simple for users to get started with their free tier.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the first custodian to implement our updated integration standard that now supports broadcasting facilitated by MMI. This fundamental upgrade lets users choose and broadcast through any RPC provider, enabling them to transact on EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<p>In one of the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/unveiling-the-power-of-metamask-snaps-on-mmi/\">latest releases</a>, MMI introduced support for Snaps. With Snaps, the functionalities of the MMI extension can be further enhanced with transaction insight Snaps and notification Snaps. With MPCVault, we take the first step to enable our customers to transact on non-EVM chains. We have initiated the work with MPCVault to build a Cosmos Snap which is a much-requested non-EVM chain support that we are receiving.</p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about MMI and MPCVault’s integration? <strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Click here</a> to schedule a demo!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> is an institution-compliant version of the world’s leading web3 wallet, MetaMask.

This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful partnership. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks, or buy crypto with fiat.
