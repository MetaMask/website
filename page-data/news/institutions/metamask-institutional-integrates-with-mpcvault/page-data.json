The major selling point is our non-custodial approach that lets users, rather than MPCVault or any other centralized party, retain complete control over their wallet keys. This is a feature increasingly sought after as centralized wallets lose credibility. The user experience of MPCVault is best-in-class and we have <a href=\"https://github.com/mpcvault/mpcvaultapis/wiki/MPCVault-API-Documentation\">robust APIs</a> our customers can build with.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What specific features or functionalities does MPCVault bring to MMI users?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault is designed to provide a versatile set of key features to help clients better manage their assets. It offers a completely self-driven platform that does not need us for operational management. Users can securely create vaults, wallets, multi-sig policies, new users, API keys, and more through user authentication without interacting with MPCVault.</p>\n<p>MPCVault supports all token types without whitelisting. If a user is minting the latest hot NFT or their own brand-new token, they can see and interact with the token in MPCVault immediately.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most attractive is our bank-like transaction history. This feature tracks all your asset movements and breaks out each transaction into its parts in a consolidated view. In a DEX swap, for example, users can view both legs of the swap and the gas payment individually. Users can also add transaction notes pre- and post-transaction to provide context around the transaction across their team. All of this is, of course, exportable to excel and queryable using our API.</p>\n<p>We also provide comprehensive blockchain support, with support for <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/supported-assets\">12 blockchains</a> currently. And we are always looking to support more to align with our customer’s needs. We can support new blockchains more easily than our competitors due to early design decisions. Lastly, but probably most importantly, we have designed the product to be intuitive and reliable. Users reliably receive signing requests and our system processes requests quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: What security measures does MPCVault have in place?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>JL:</strong> MPCVault’s architecture eliminates any single point of vulnerability and empowers users to secure their assets in self-custody. any consumer and custodial wallets require just one private, encrypted key to authorize transactions. However, business decisions often involve approvals from multiple parties for internal control, which is exactly what MPCVault allows.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the only wallet solution that utilizes all three major cloud platforms – AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Our multi-cloud approach further reduces the potential for compromises that could occur with a single-cloud provider. The runtime environments are secured with Trusted Execution Environments. MPCVault utilizes AMD's SEV and Intel's SGX to create an orthogonal risk profile and enhance protection for users’ assets by employing encrypted memory, ephemeral cryptography, and remote attestation. To reduce the trust base, all critical components and communications within MPCVault are end-to-end secured using public key pinning.</p>\n<p>Aside from safeguarding keys, an enterprise-facing wallet should also protect client assets in a manner that web2 antivirus software works to protect users from attacks. To that end, MPCVault’s wallet solution comes with a security layer that scans for phishing URLs, detects suspicious behaviour, checks for interacted addresses, and performs semantic analysis and transaction simulation to help users understand what transactions they are signing.</p>\n<p>Finally, MPCVault is SOC 2 Type 2 certified as a vendor for enterprise software. We also undergo regular penetration testing to proactively identify potential risks and implement mitigation measures.</p>\n<p><strong>RH: Now let’s look at how the integration between MMI and MPCVault will bring added advantages and facilitate scalability for users.</strong></p>\n<p>Aligning with MPCVault will offer our users access to an MPC provider, which provides an extensive suite of features at a <a href=\"https://mpcvault.com/pricing\">competitive price point</a>. Moreover, MPCVault makes it very simple for users to get started with their free tier.</p>\n<p>MPCVault is the first custodian to implement our updated integration standard that now supports broadcasting facilitated by MMI. This fundamental upgrade lets users choose and broadcast through any RPC provider, enabling them to transact on EVM-compatible chains.</p>\n<p>In one of the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/unveiling-the-power-of-metamask-snaps-on-mmi/\">latest releases</a>, MMI introduced support for Snaps. With Snaps, the functionalities of the MMI extension can be further enhanced with transaction insight Snaps and notification Snaps. With MPCVault, we take the first step to enable our customers to transact on non-EVM chains. We have initiated the work with MPCVault to build a Cosmos Snap which is a much-requested non-EVM chain support that we are receiving.</p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about MMI and MPCVault’s integration? <strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Click here</a> to schedule a demo!</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> is an institution-compliant version of the world’s leading web3 wallet, MetaMask.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.
