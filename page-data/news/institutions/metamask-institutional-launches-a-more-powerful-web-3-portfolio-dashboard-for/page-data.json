Over the last two years, we have built features in service of our goal to bridge all organizations into the web3 ecosystem. Today, we are pleased to step closer to this goal with the launch of a more powerful version of our web3 portfolio dashboard.</p>\n<p>Our updated <strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/portfolio/\">dashboard</a></strong> offers a range of cutting-edge tools that will enable organizations to better manage how they interact with web3. These tools include institutional controls, portfolio management, digital asset monitoring, and in-depth transaction reporting, all in one place.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we dive into what’s new, how these features impact users, and how they redefine the institutional web3 experience.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://youtu.be/6duEdFALQR0\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/portfolio/\">Explore the Web3 Portfolio Dashboard\n</a></strong></p>\n<h1>Portfolio Management</h1>\n<p>On our web3 portfolio dashboard, organizations are now able to swap crypto and stake ETH seamlessly within the dashboard interface.</p>\n<h2>Swap Crypto</h2>\n<p>The MMI dashboard allows users to identify the best priced quote for their swap by pooling liquidity data from multiple aggregators, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs). This allows organizations to take advantage of optimal gas prices, and transact with some of the lowest failure rates.</p>\n<p>MMI’s swap feature provides users with a simplified experience, enabling them to swap any ERC-20 token across multiple DEXs. This feature was previously only accessible through the MMI browser extension.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2iu3OwffKc\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Stake ETH</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most significant upgrade within the MMI portfolio dashboard is the launch of the first institutional ETH staking marketplace. Previously, choosing the right staking service provider could be challenging for organizations due to the complexities between different providers’ infrastructure configurations (multi-cloud, multi-region, and multi-client), certifications, reporting standards, fee structures, and terms and conditions (T&#x26;C).</p>\n<p>MMI addresses this complexity by simplifying vendor selection and streamlining access to four top-tier institutional staking providers with standardized T&#x26;Cs, comprehensive reporting templates, and a significantly simplified staking experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/632mmsR7BJgfZO8cIolYlV/36cc36dbc0d8f3e7e0243f7c659e5ae9/Staking-marketing-screen.png\" alt=\"Staking-marketing-screen\"></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-launches-the-first-marketplace-for-institutional-staking-on-metamask-institutional-in-partnership-with-allnodes-blockdaemon-and-kiln\">Read the press release</a></strong></p>\n<p>Today, organizations can choose to stake their ETH with Allnodes, Blockdaemon, Consensys, and Kiln from within the MMI portfolio dashboard, and earn rewards for securing the Ethereum blockchain. Once withdrawals are activated by the Shanghai/Capella Upgrade in April, organizations will be able to withdraw from within the dashboard as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/staking/\"><strong>Explore the Institutional Marketplace</strong></a></p>\n<h1>Digital Asset Monitoring</h1>\n<p>Digital asset monitoring on the MMI portfolio dashboard allows organizations to see a consolidated view of their web3 assets across all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains in one place.</p>\n<h2>See Performance and P&#x26;L Attribution</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows organizations to see their portfolio’s performance and profit &#x26; loss attribution for all ERC-20 tokens and 10 of the largest DeFi protocols—a feature that is uniquely offered by MMI.</p>\n<p>We do this by using our transaction simulator and DeFi adapters to simulate the selling of the token of a liquidity provider (LP), to break up the LP token into its underlying supplied tokens within a position. We also determine the claimed and unclaimed rewards of the positions. This allows organizations to understand the value of their DeFi positions, including the profit or loss and performance of their positions at all times.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3kT4g33ZcjARN94P0w7iXS/9ef5c79191822606582008d288ea3fb6/bwzcky6fhRg7WQ-Xiep4YcryohZr2U6PMEX7dkEcbs36eBlIMQUnrrXaXrq3gT7w0ggVSR17dw8dlbuS4bQMH3YmpioJzn2o6lDitGbHJon_vNruoFhuYUvBA29Z.png\" alt=\"bwzcky6fhRg7WQ-Xiep4YcryohZr2U6PMEX7dkEcbs36eBlIMQUnrrXaXrq3gT7w0ggVSR17dw8dlbuS4bQMH3YmpioJzn2o6lDitGbHJon vNruoFhuYUvBA29ZiqcC\"></p>\n<h2>Track NFTs</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows users to view detailed metrics for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) held across different custodians, wallets, accounts, and marketplaces. It provides organizations with improved capability around their NFT holdings, with metrics including average sale price, aggregate floor price data from different marketplaces, price estimates, collection price history, historical price charts, rarity rank, and traits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/CgcXcxcreKbra3kVuUlBq/bc52db0e1dc596a2efb2489643144621/MDaNFV2R75l1rH2L3KyMBudtwR-1AWkikv4yCsVOzFSnyg0n7ORN8O_-zZcvGc4zncLpaV7mtpH1duYnZQ4crQ14gxB9O5LeHvPs40755U6rJmsvM6gyVjUEqHZd.png\" alt=\"MDaNFV2R75l1rH2L3KyMBudtwR-1AWkikv4yCsVOzFSnyg0n7ORN8O -zZcvGc4zncLpaV7mtpH1duYnZQ4crQ14gxB9O5LeHvPs40755U6rJmsvM6gyVjUEqHZdRECX\"></p>\n<h2>Bundle Accounts</h2>\n<p>The dashboard enables organizations to group accounts into portfolio bundles across their team or organization. The MMI dashboard and browser extension allows users to have up to 100 accounts. By bundling these accounts, they can better manage and monitor account and portfolio activity</p>\n<h2>Manage Assets with a Web3 Focus</h2>\n<p>The dashboard allows organizations to monitor their web3 assets across all EVM chains. They can see a breakdown of their organization’s portfolio, including digital asset holdings, sector allocation, protocol allocation, performance, and historical transactions. They can also add smart contract addresses and valuations that they wish to monitor.</p>\n<h1>Transaction Reporting</h1>\n<p>Comprehensive transaction reporting is crucial for organizations that are required to share transaction history and details with stakeholders such as fund admins, LPs, and other third parties.</p>\n<h2>Classify Transactions</h2>\n<p>Users can now see transactions classified as a transfer, bridge, fee, yield, or the supply or removal of liquidity.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
