With this partnership, MMI expands its cryptocurrency custody offerings to integrate custody options for Web3-native organizations such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>\n<p>Gnosis Safe is one of the most popular digital asset management platforms for DAOs, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">over $90B</a> worth of assets stored in self custody. Many DAOs, including Uniswap, Maker DAO, Aave, and Bit DAO use Gnosis Safe for their custody needs.</p>\n<p>DAOs prefer Gnosis Safe for its multi-sig security feature, which provides them with additional security to deploy funds. Using this feature, DAOs can ensure that multiple stakeholders sign off on a transaction before funds are released.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a deeper look into Gnosis’ multi-sig security, and why DAOs need it.</p>\n<h2>DAOs and their Unique Custody Needs</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/\">DAO</a> is a community-led organization that is designed to decentralize control. There is no central decision-making authority, and all important matters are decided on by all members of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Individual DAO members create a proposal such as those related to functioning, treasury allocations, even the future of the DAO. All members of the DAO can then vote on these proposals using their governance tokens. When a pre-decided consensus is reached on a proposal, then it is accepted and enforced by the rules coded within a smart contract.</p>\n<p>Since there is no central authority that is signing off on decisions, DAOs require multiple members to be signatories to their transactions. This is imperative to maintain the decentralization that is core to the structure of DAOs. This is where Gnosis Safe’s multi-sig feature is best suited for DAOs to manage their crypto transactions since it  requires multiple members to confirm the transaction before it is executed. This adds an extra layer of security to the DAO treasury and prevents unauthorized use of DAO funds.</p>\n<h2>MMI and Gnosis Safe Give DAOs Unrivaled Access to DeFi</h2>\n<p>Currently, DAOs can use Gnosis Safe to manage their funds in two ways. First, they can transact directly with the Gnosis Safe wallet and their ecosystem of apps called <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-gnosis-safe-apps-faef908f69c6\">Safe apps</a>. Second, they can connect their wallet of choice with Gnosis Safe using <a href=\"https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4356253-walletconnect-safe-app\">WalletConnect</a>. To do so, they have to scan a QR code to connect WalletConnect with the dapp they wish to use. This process is cumbersome, and also limits the DAOs access to the DeFi ecosystem to the dapps and protocols that WalletConnect supports.</p>\n<p>With MMI’s partnership with Gnosis, DAOs have a third, more convenient way to connect with DeFi. This gives them unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem because MMI connects to over 17,000 dapps. MMI also allows DAOs to join MetaMask’s 20M monthly active users across the globe in accessing Web3. In addition, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI’s DeFi and Web3 portfolio dashboard</a>, DAOs can get a holistic overview of their portfolio, its performance, individual assets, and historical transactions.</p>\n<p>“Gnosis Safe is a foundational cornerstone of our ecosystem—an unmatched and trusted platform on which most DAOs rely to secure and manage their digital assets. This integration, therefore, brings together these two important elements</p>\n<p>for organisations; unrivaled access and trusted security. We are, therefore, thrilled by this partnership and the further collaboration between Gnosis Safe and ConsenSys,” <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/metamask-institutional-x-gnosis-safe-45fc852b4186\">says Johann Bornman</a>, Global Product Lead for MMI.</p>\n<h2>MMI and Decentralization</h2>\n<p>The partnership between MMI and Gnosis Safe also strengthens ConsenSys’ commitment towards Web3-native organizations, and towards Ethereum’s goal of decentralization.</p>\n<p>A decentralized web is a cornerstone of ConsenSys’ product philosophy. For example, the company has been enabling wider participation in ecosystem governance through <a href=\"https://consensys.net/solutions/daos-and-web3-governance/\">DAO creation and participation</a>. There currently are three DAOs – Village DAO, Education DAO, and Sandbox DAO – that are powered by ConsenSys.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, ConsenSys promotes decentralization through its products. Metamask is the first wallet to offer extensibility to users, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-metamask-flask-enables-developers-to-build-the-latest-technical-innovations-in-web3/\">Metamask Flask</a>. Flask is a proving ground for developers to roll out experimental features in Metamask. The first feature to be released through Flask was Snaps, which allows developers to expand the functionality of Metamask at runtime, without any involvement from us. Snaps is poised to accelerate the rate of innovation not just in Ethereum, but the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>MMI and its Custody Offerings</h2>\n<p>MMI’s Gnosis integration comes as part of its <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">expansion of custody solutions</a> to cater to the needs of a wide range of organizations, across different geographies and with different tech stack requirements.</p>\n<p>MMI has partnered with <a href=\"https://hextrust.com/\">Hex Trust</a> to expand its institutional-grade custody offerings into Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Asia.

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, MoonPay.</strong></p>\n<p>MoonPay is a leading crypto company that lets users buy and sell digital assets directly with their MetaMask wallet. Since MoonPay’s partnership with MetaMask began in 2022, we’ve been dedicated to simplifying the management of cryptocurrencies, while keeping users secure. Let’s dive into the ways our collaboration achieves this.</p>\n<h2>Streamlining DeFi onboarding</h2>\n<p>As the demand for self-custodial wallets has risen, so too has the need for robust and intuitive tools that give users a frictionless “web2-like” experience. In the past, the two haven’t always mixed well. Newcomers to crypto, who typically have the highest appetite for intuitive UX, tend to find DeFi overly complex.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this tension, MoonPay saw an opportunity to bridge-the-gap by providing seamless cash-to-crypto onboarding to the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, MetaMask. Integrating with MoonPay allowed MetaMask’s millions of users to interface with DeFi through familiar payment options like credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. It also allowed MetaMask users to benefit from MoonPay’s stringent security protocols.</p>\n<h2>Simplifying ramps to protect users</h2>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the integration is that users can purchase digital assets directly within MetaMask wallet — eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms. This approach smoothes out the process, while keeping users’ information safe. By avoiding unnecessary third-party platforms, data exposure is minimized.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing exposure by helping users stay within the platform, MoonPay is committed to protection and security in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ramps are built with advanced encryption technology like AES-256.</li>\n<li>We comply with PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 standards, ensuring we meet stringent data security criteria.</li>\n<li>Our systems have undergone independent audits for PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001/27018, and SOC2 Type 2 certifications, giving users peace of mind that our safety standards don’t waver.</li>\n<li>Our rigorous Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies helps prevent bad actors from entering our ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating a more secure web3</h2>\n<p>As we continue to work alongside MetaMask, our shared focus on safe, user-friendly solutions remains a cornerstone of this partnership. Together, we’re not only simplifying crypto onboarding for newcomers – we’re setting the bar for what it means to prioritize security in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and selling crypto with your MetaMask wallet via MoonPay has never been easier. It’s easy, fast, and safe. <a href=\"https://live.moonpay.com/metamask\">Get started today.</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"Making DeFi onboarding safer with MoonPay","metaDescription":"Find out how MetaMask and MoonPay enable DeFi onboarding that is secure and seamless.
