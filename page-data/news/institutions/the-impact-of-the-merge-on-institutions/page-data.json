Over the last two years, many leading institutions have taken meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem by pivoting their business model to focus on Web3, and by deploying capital into the ecosystem. According to a CoinShares report, institutions <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/news/top/6693616\">invested $9.3B</a> into the crypto market in 2021, up 36% from 2020.</p>\n<p>The increasing institutional interest in crypto can be attributed to the growing maturity of the technology, as well as the changes in the ecosystem that have had a profound impact on institutional adoption. One such fundamental change, called <a href=\"https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/the-merge/\">the Merge</a>, to the Ethereum ecosystem is set to occur mid-September.</p>\n<p>The Merge will transition the Ethereum blockchain network from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The move to PoS will increase the security of the Ethereum network, and set it up for future scalability. This is likely to make institutions more keen to engage with the Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In our recently released ‘<strong>Impact of the Merge on Institutions</strong>’ report, we discuss in detail the opportunities that the Merge will create for institutions in the world of Web3. Written by <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> and the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/insights/cryptoeconomic-research/\">ConsenSys Cryptoeconomic Research</a> team, the report also explores the factors, such as <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/why-ethereum-is-poised-for-growth-a-look-at-network-activity/\">network activity</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/why-ethereum-is-poised-for-growth-a-look-at-network-security/\">security</a>, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/why-ethereum-is-poised-for-growth-a-look-at-network-valuation/\">valuation</a>, which are setting Ethereum up for long-term growth and success. You can find the full report <strong><a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/impact-of-the-merge-on-institutions-insight-report-sept-2022\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In this post, we take a look at how the Merge will impact institutions.</p>\n<h2>Reduced Carbon Footprint</h2>\n<p>The shift to PoS means a 99.95% decrease in energy consumption due to the removal of PoW physical GPU (graphics processing unit) node processors and their replacement by lightweight servers running validator clients. The reduction of Ethereum’s carbon footprint will be significant for institutional investors, especially traditional organizations who need to meet certain environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates in their portfolios. After the Merge, there will be an opportunity to obtain real yield without compromising on sustainability goals.</p>\n<p>Through this lens, transacting on Ethereum may look more attractive than on other Layer 1 chains that do not offer the same energy efficiency.</p>\n<h2>New and Attractive Staking Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Staking contracts will continue to follow the staking vs total value locked (TVL) % earning curve. Individuals and institutions can earn rewards through staking for participating in network consensus. Investors are likely to obtain positive real yield, estimated to be between 5.5-13.2%. In a world of negative real yields, the positive real yield will make ETH staking a particularly attractive opportunity. In addition, liquid staking opportunities created by centralized services like Lido will continue to lower barriers to entry by allowing investors to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity in the form of ETH derivatives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2MsjWMcBBwtfKsdfvL5LhO/5d863bfeeaf2d949e5994b20bf188625/Eth-staked.png\" alt=\"Eth-staked\">\nFigure 1. Total ETH Staked vs Estimated APR\nSource: Staking Rewards</p>\n<h2>Deflationary Supply of ETH</h2>\n<p>Reduced ETH issuance and increased burns not only caps, but systematically reduces ETH supply. The reduced supply will put deflationary pressure on ETH and diminish the risk of token price dropping to zero. For institutions, ETH may become a more attractive asset, as reduced supply may lead to an increase in value.</p>\n<h2>Improved Security</h2>\n<h3>Enhanced Decentralization</h3>\n<p>The democratized participation of the PoS system produces enhanced decentralization, and thereby a dramatic increase in the cost of attacking the Ethereum blockchain. As of August 2022, more that 13.3M ETH had been staked by over 415,000 validators—This ensures the near impossibility of attack. With these numbers, a 51% attack would cost over $11B.</p>\n<h3>Cross-team Ecosystem Collaboration</h3>\n<p>The Ethereum network is fueled by a diverse ecosystem of participants building together on an open-source framework, on a global scale. Collaboration across the protocol ecosystem leads to fewer centralized points of failure. This ensures confidence in the community to build and execute.</p>\n<p>These points each provide stronger security guarantees for both institutional and retail participation.</p>\n<h2>Ecosystem Growth</h2>\n<p>On-chain applications and Layer 2 (L2) solutions will likely leverage the above improved security conditions and multiply on top of Ethereum. This could produce another explosion in the number of applications deployed, and opportunities created for institutions.</p>\n<h2>Client Diversity and Interoperability</h2>\n<p>Ethereum is the network with the highest number of live client instances that can fully interoperate. Integration can occur with any major coding language and in collaboration with different companies. The breadth of options will allow institutions to choose how they want to interact with Web3. Each one can choose to rely on client(s) that fit with their precise requirements.</p>\n<p>Beyond these general outcomes, we expect to see the Merge impact different kinds of institutions in different ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Crypto funds</strong> are likely to diversify their investment strategy with protocol staking for base returns. ETH and ETH derivatives, such as for liquid staking, offer liquid yield returns in addition to other farming strategies funds may deploy.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading firms</strong> are likely to see short-term gains with high-volume trades and position adjustments leading up to the Merge. Volatile markets provide opportunities for market makers.</p>\n<p><strong>For pension funds and endowments</strong>, 401k spot exposure to cryptocurrency assets may expand to tokens representing derivatives of these assets. There may be an adjustment of positions for long term returns.</p>\n<p><strong>If L2s and other protocols</strong> use ETH to settle their transactions to Ethereum, then these projects may have already been buying ETH through the bear market in order to operate on the network for future launches. At the time of this report, this demand may have already been priced in.</p>\n<p>As ETH dramatically reduces its carbon footprint, <strong>traditional organizations and financial institutions</strong> may look into opportunities to get exposure to DeFi services. This may start with NFT drops or embedding wallet features into banking applications for stablecoin custody and conversion. Further, financial institutions may add stablecoins onto their balance sheets and attract portfolio managers to build exposure to yield farming opportunities on DeFi protocols launched on Ethereum.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A look at Ethereum’s roadmap makes it clear that the community is building the network and its technology for the long term. The Merge is a step in the right direction. However, it is only the first one in the journey towards a better Ethereum. We discuss the planned upgrades to Ethereum that will follow the Merge in the full <a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/impact-of-the-merge-on-institutions-insight-report-sept-2022\">Impact of the Merge on Institutions report</a>.</p>\n<p>On September 12th, the key contributors will discuss the report’s findings on our “Breaking Down the Merge for Institutions” webinar. You can register for it <a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/breaking-down-the-merge-for-institutions-webinar-sept-2022\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>A commitment to continuous improvement of the network and the technology powering Ethereum is a powerful way that it is able to attract increasing institutional interest. Strong institutional appetite for the ecosystem despite current geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, and the recent market volatility points to that fact.</p>\n<p>Financial institutions—investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays, hedge funds like Citadel Securities and Point72 Ventures, and retail banks such as Banco Santander and Itau Unibanco—are putting their money in crypto, or furthering their plans to offer crypto investment options to their clients. As the Ethereum community continues to build through the bear market, we believe that the future is bright for institutional DeFi.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Disclaimer: ConsenSys Software Inc. is not a registered or licensed advisor or broker.

across various platforms is crucial. Recognizing this need, MetaMask is thrilled to introduce a new feature within the MetaMask Portfolio to significantly streamline the process of transferring assets between centralized exchange (CEX) platforms like Coinbase and Binance and MetaMask.</p>\n<p>For many users, the digital asset landscape is scattered across multiple wallets and accounts, creating a fragmented experience. The challenge of moving assets from one platform to another has often been a cumbersome process, fraught with the risks of copying and pasting addresses incorrectly and exposing oneself to potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>MetaMask's latest update aims to address this issue head-on, offering a solution that not only enhances user experience but also bolsters security.</p>\n<h4><strong>Instant transfer of assets from exchanges to into your MetaMask wallet</strong></h4>\n<p>With the new integration, users can now effortlessly link their Coinbase or Binance accounts to their MetaMask wallet directly from the MetaMask Portfolio dashboard. MetaMask will never have access to exchange login credentials nor share any MetaMask wallet addresses with any third parties. Check out the below tutorial to see how it easy it is to connect to an exchange and transfer funds:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_wNpeCZubE?si=ZiWR5woPiWo4iS1D\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>This seamless connection allows for the instant transfer of assets between accounts, eliminating the need for the manual entry of addresses. Additionally, for those with bank accounts linked to their Coinbase or Binance accounts, purchasing crypto directly into their MetaMask wallet has never been easier. Here's what's new:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Direct Integration</strong>: This feature enables users to transfer assets between their Coinbase or Binance accounts and MetaMask with just a few clicks, bypassing the cumbersome process of copying and pasting addresses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fiat to Crypto Onramp</strong>: Users can now directly convert fiat to crypto in their MetaMask account through their linked bank account on CEXs, streamlining the process of adding funds to their wallets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's important to note that, initially, this feature will support transfers from Coinbase or Binance accounts only, with plans to expand to other exchanges soon. No fees will be charged when transferring assets from exchanges to MetaMask, but a nominal transaction fee of 0.25% will be applied when transferring from MetaMask to centralized exchanges, ensuring the sustainability of this valuable service. Network gas fees also apply.</p>\n<h4><strong>Improving web3 UX with MetaMask step-by-step</strong></h4>\n<p>This update is a step forward in MetaMask's mission to simplify the crypto experience, making it more accessible and secure for users worldwide. By bridging the gap between self-custodial and centralized platforms, MetaMask is not just solving the fragmentation issue within the ecosystem but also paving the way for a more integrated and user-friendly digital asset environment.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"Transfers from CEX now available in MetaMask Portfolio ","metaDescription":"MetaMask's new CEX transfer feature simplifies asset transfers between centralized exchanges, enhancing both security and user experience.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"4uNWsEJpmKwVHI5EaNYsAQ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"More With MetaMask: Mendi Finance Snap","slug":"more-with-metamask-partner-series-mendi-finance","subtitle":"The More With MetaMask Partner Series explores builders who are transforming web3.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy.
