They may not yet fully understand the drivers behind DeFi or Web3, but learned that the asset class cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>As a result, institutions dominated DeFi transactions in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. Large institutional transactions, which are transactions above $10M, accounted for <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-defi-adoption-index/\">over 60% of all DeFi transactions</a> over this period.</p>\n<p>Part of the attraction of DeFi for institutions are the high yields offered across the sector, when compared with returns from traditional finance (TradFi) instruments.

While the high yields offered an attractive opportunity for these banks, the regulatory and technology uncertainty involved kept them away from the ecosystem. 2021 changed that. Many investment banks–including Blackrock, BNYMellon, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-goldman-sachs-restarts-cryptocurrency-desk-amid-bitcoin-boom-2021-03-01/\">Goldman Sachs</a>–either revived their crypto desks, or entered the space.</p>\n<p>The year began with the news that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/01/20/blackrock-files-to-add-bitcoin-futures-to-funds/?sh=6f85db693086\">Blackrock had filed with the SEC</a> to add bitcoin exposure to two of its investment funds. The world’s largest asset manager also invested <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-invests-384m-bitcoin-mining-121211742.html\">$384M in bitcoin mining companies</a> last year, its regulatory filings showed. In a push towards greater acceptance of crypto as an investment, <a href=\"https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-release/bny-mellon-forms-new-digital-assets-unit-to-build-industrypercent27s-first-multi-asset-digital-platform-130169.html\">BNY Mellon</a>, the oldest bank in the US, formed a new digital assets unit, to provide services around bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html\">Goldman Sachs</a> decided to offer their wealth management clients access to bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank, the investment arm of the European Union, issued its <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/stories/cryptocurrency-blockchain-bonds\">first ever digital bond</a>, worth 100M euros, on public blockchain. Societe Generale, France’s third-largest bank, also proposed to <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/socgen-wants-to-borrow-20m-dai-on-makerdao-using-tokenized-bonds-as-collateral/\">borrow $20M in </a>Dai from MakerDAO, one of the largest DeFI protocols.</p>\n<h2>Retail Banks</h2>\n<p>From calling digital currencies a “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html\">fraud</a>”, to offering custodial services for their digital assets to clients, retail banks have come full circle in their relationship with digital currencies. In 2021, many retail banks either started offering bitcoin exposure, or considering such exposure for clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/04/26/jpmorgan-to-let-clients-invest-in-bitcoin-fund-for-first-time-sources/\">JPMorgan Chase</a> said in January that it may offer some clients the opportunity to invest in bitcoin funds. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-launches-digital-assets-unit-confirming-crypto-plans/602433/\">Citibank</a> launched a digital assets unit offering crypto investment services amid increasing interest from its clients.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan did not just stop at bitcoin funds. Later in the year, it partnered with <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/115087/wells-fargo-jpmorgan-partner-with-nydig-to-launch-bitcoin-funds\">Wells Fargo and NYDIG</a> to offer bitcoin exposure to their respective clients. In addition, JPMorgan launched an <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/05/jpmorgan-launches-in-house-bitcoin-fund-for-private-bank-clients/\">in-house bitcoin fund</a> for its private banking clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bofa-global-research-launches-coverage-of-digital-assets-301391753.html\">Bank of America</a> launched a research unit to look into digital assets, while <a href=\"https://ir.usbank.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-bank-announces-new-cryptocurrency-custody-services\">US Bank</a> launched cryptocurrency custody services.</p>\n<h2>DeFi Projects</h2>\n<p>In 2021, the walls between the DeFi and the TradFi worlds became increasingly porous. While institutions tested crypto waters, DeFi companies welcomed both venture capital, and human resources from the TradFi world.</p>\n<p>Crypto exchange <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104870/ftx-us-former-citadel-securities-brett-harrison-crypto-exchange\">FTX brought in Brett Harrison</a> as its first president. Harrison joined FTX from Citadel Securities, a leading global market maker. The company also <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/ftx-crypto-exchange-25-billion-valuation-74d4f9ee-073c-45fc-a888-ea05536d6f9d.html\">hit $25B in valuation</a>, when it raised $900M in July 2021.</p>\n<p>In another vote of trust for DeFi, crypto custodian Anchorage’s proposal to <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/54074/anchorage-first-federal-charter-digital-asset-bank\">become a digital bank</a> was approved by the US finance regulator in January 2021. Anchorage ended the year at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-350-million-at-3-billion-valuation/\">$3B valuation</a> after it raised $350M in December 2021.</p>\n<p>2021 was also a blockbuster year for ConsenSys. ConsenSys ended the year with a $3.2B valuation. The company’s famous crypto wallet, MetaMask, continued on its growth trajectory, reaching <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-21-million-maus-as-consensys-raises-200-million-to-make-web3-universally-easy-to-use-access-and-build-on/\">over 21M users</a> as of November 2021. <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">MetaMask Institutional partnered</a> with three leading custodians: BitGo, Qredo, and Cactus Custody to support institutional firms engaging with on-chain protocols.</p>\n<p>In another first for DeFi, Swiss digital bank Sygnum said it would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sygnum-becomes-first-bank-in-the-world-to-offer-eth2-staking\">allow its customers to stake their ETH</a> through its institutional banking platform. Crypto trading platform <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptocurrency-firm-bullish-go-public-9-bln-spac-deal-2021-07-09/\">Bullish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/08/usdc-stablecoin-backer-circle-to-go-public-in-45b-spac-deal/\">Circle</a> announced plans to go public via SPACs, while USDC-backer Circle also planned to become a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-plans-to-become-a-full-reserve-national-digital-currency-bank\">full-reserve digital bank</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Time for DeFi has Come</h2>\n<p>In 2021, many leading institutions shifted away from skepticism and took meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem with business model pivots and capital deployment.</p>\n<p>A whopping 90% of crypto’s largest deals happened in 2021, according to <a href=\"https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf\">a Messari report</a>. And this 90% did not even include Coinbase’s direct listing, which valued the crypto exchange at nearly $86B.</p>\n<p>These strides are strong indicators of the upwards journey of institutional interest in 2022. According to an Intertrust survey, hedge funds plan to hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f8044bf-8f0f-46b4-9fb7-6d0eba723017\">an average of 7% of their holdings</a> in cryptocurrencies by 2026. The long-term growth opportunity for DeFi can be gauged from the fact that the market cap of all DeFi protocols ($149B at the end of December 2021) is less than 1% of that of global banks—highlighting enormous room for growth.</p>\n<p>Organizations can embark on their journey into DeFi with MetaMask Institutional (MMI), a DeFi wallet and Web3 gateway built for institutions. MMI offers unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem, without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements. It enables crypto funds, market makers, and trading desks to trade, stake, borrow, lend, invest, and interact with over 17,000 DeFi protocols and applications.</p>\n<p><a

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, Yooldo.</strong></p>\n<p>Web3 is an ever-evolving world, and decentralization is reshaping various industries, including gaming. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy, MetaMask is an essential partner.</p>\n<h2>A new era of gaming</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nIn traditional online gaming, players' assets are stored on centralized servers that are controlled by the game developer or publisher. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. By contrast, in web3 players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. Powered by blockchain technology, this decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control, with no monolithic authority able to manipulate user assets or restrict access.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask secures gaming assets</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nWith ownership comes gamers’ responsibility of safeguarding their assets. The decentralized security MetaMask offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users maintain control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, safe-guarded by blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>, is another critical feature. MetaMask offers in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. Yooldo gamers are alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering Gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p><br></br>\nAs the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. This means that assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay.

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Enhanced Security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, also sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. It also allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.For the MetaMask app, the minimum required version is v. 7.31.1.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to use MetaMask with NGRAVE</h2>\n<p><br></br>\n<strong>Sync MetaMask with NGRAVE ZERO</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your ZERO, go to Settings → Sync With App → MetaMask.

Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials.

As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from MetaMask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams.

Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts.

This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities.
