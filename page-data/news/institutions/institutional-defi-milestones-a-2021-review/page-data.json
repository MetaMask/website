They may not yet fully understand the drivers behind DeFi or Web3, but learned that the asset class cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>As a result, institutions dominated DeFi transactions in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. Large institutional transactions, which are transactions above $10M, accounted for <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-defi-adoption-index/\">over 60% of all DeFi transactions</a> over this period.</p>\n<p>Part of the attraction of DeFi for institutions are the high yields offered across the sector, when compared with returns from traditional finance (TradFi) instruments.

While the high yields offered an attractive opportunity for these banks, the regulatory and technology uncertainty involved kept them away from the ecosystem. 2021 changed that. Many investment banks–including Blackrock, BNYMellon, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-goldman-sachs-restarts-cryptocurrency-desk-amid-bitcoin-boom-2021-03-01/\">Goldman Sachs</a>–either revived their crypto desks, or entered the space.</p>\n<p>The year began with the news that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/01/20/blackrock-files-to-add-bitcoin-futures-to-funds/?sh=6f85db693086\">Blackrock had filed with the SEC</a> to add bitcoin exposure to two of its investment funds. The world’s largest asset manager also invested <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-invests-384m-bitcoin-mining-121211742.html\">$384M in bitcoin mining companies</a> last year, its regulatory filings showed. In a push towards greater acceptance of crypto as an investment, <a href=\"https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-release/bny-mellon-forms-new-digital-assets-unit-to-build-industrypercent27s-first-multi-asset-digital-platform-130169.html\">BNY Mellon</a>, the oldest bank in the US, formed a new digital assets unit, to provide services around bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html\">Goldman Sachs</a> decided to offer their wealth management clients access to bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank, the investment arm of the European Union, issued its <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/stories/cryptocurrency-blockchain-bonds\">first ever digital bond</a>, worth 100M euros, on public blockchain. Societe Generale, France’s third-largest bank, also proposed to <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/socgen-wants-to-borrow-20m-dai-on-makerdao-using-tokenized-bonds-as-collateral/\">borrow $20M in </a>Dai from MakerDAO, one of the largest DeFI protocols.</p>\n<h2>Retail Banks</h2>\n<p>From calling digital currencies a “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html\">fraud</a>”, to offering custodial services for their digital assets to clients, retail banks have come full circle in their relationship with digital currencies. In 2021, many retail banks either started offering bitcoin exposure, or considering such exposure for clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/04/26/jpmorgan-to-let-clients-invest-in-bitcoin-fund-for-first-time-sources/\">JPMorgan Chase</a> said in January that it may offer some clients the opportunity to invest in bitcoin funds. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-launches-digital-assets-unit-confirming-crypto-plans/602433/\">Citibank</a> launched a digital assets unit offering crypto investment services amid increasing interest from its clients.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan did not just stop at bitcoin funds. Later in the year, it partnered with <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/115087/wells-fargo-jpmorgan-partner-with-nydig-to-launch-bitcoin-funds\">Wells Fargo and NYDIG</a> to offer bitcoin exposure to their respective clients. In addition, JPMorgan launched an <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/05/jpmorgan-launches-in-house-bitcoin-fund-for-private-bank-clients/\">in-house bitcoin fund</a> for its private banking clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bofa-global-research-launches-coverage-of-digital-assets-301391753.html\">Bank of America</a> launched a research unit to look into digital assets, while <a href=\"https://ir.usbank.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-bank-announces-new-cryptocurrency-custody-services\">US Bank</a> launched cryptocurrency custody services.</p>\n<h2>DeFi Projects</h2>\n<p>In 2021, the walls between the DeFi and the TradFi worlds became increasingly porous. While institutions tested crypto waters, DeFi companies welcomed both venture capital, and human resources from the TradFi world.</p>\n<p>Crypto exchange <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104870/ftx-us-former-citadel-securities-brett-harrison-crypto-exchange\">FTX brought in Brett Harrison</a> as its first president. Harrison joined FTX from Citadel Securities, a leading global market maker. The company also <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/ftx-crypto-exchange-25-billion-valuation-74d4f9ee-073c-45fc-a888-ea05536d6f9d.html\">hit $25B in valuation</a>, when it raised $900M in July 2021.</p>\n<p>In another vote of trust for DeFi, crypto custodian Anchorage’s proposal to <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/54074/anchorage-first-federal-charter-digital-asset-bank\">become a digital bank</a> was approved by the US finance regulator in January 2021. Anchorage ended the year at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-350-million-at-3-billion-valuation/\">$3B valuation</a> after it raised $350M in December 2021.</p>\n<p>2021 was also a blockbuster year for ConsenSys. ConsenSys ended the year with a $3.2B valuation. The company’s famous crypto wallet, MetaMask, continued on its growth trajectory, reaching <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-21-million-maus-as-consensys-raises-200-million-to-make-web3-universally-easy-to-use-access-and-build-on/\">over 21M users</a> as of November 2021. <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">MetaMask Institutional partnered</a> with three leading custodians: BitGo, Qredo, and Cactus Custody to support institutional firms engaging with on-chain protocols.</p>\n<p>In another first for DeFi, Swiss digital bank Sygnum said it would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sygnum-becomes-first-bank-in-the-world-to-offer-eth2-staking\">allow its customers to stake their ETH</a> through its institutional banking platform. Crypto trading platform <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptocurrency-firm-bullish-go-public-9-bln-spac-deal-2021-07-09/\">Bullish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/08/usdc-stablecoin-backer-circle-to-go-public-in-45b-spac-deal/\">Circle</a> announced plans to go public via SPACs, while USDC-backer Circle also planned to become a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-plans-to-become-a-full-reserve-national-digital-currency-bank\">full-reserve digital bank</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Time for DeFi has Come</h2>\n<p>In 2021, many leading institutions shifted away from skepticism and took meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem with business model pivots and capital deployment.</p>\n<p>A whopping 90% of crypto’s largest deals happened in 2021, according to <a href=\"https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf\">a Messari report</a>. And this 90% did not even include Coinbase’s direct listing, which valued the crypto exchange at nearly $86B.</p>\n<p>These strides are strong indicators of the upwards journey of institutional interest in 2022. According to an Intertrust survey, hedge funds plan to hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f8044bf-8f0f-46b4-9fb7-6d0eba723017\">an average of 7% of their holdings</a> in cryptocurrencies by 2026. The long-term growth opportunity for DeFi can be gauged from the fact that the market cap of all DeFi protocols ($149B at the end of December 2021) is less than 1% of that of global banks—highlighting enormous room for growth.</p>\n<p>Organizations can embark on their journey into DeFi with MetaMask Institutional (MMI), a DeFi wallet and Web3 gateway built for institutions. MMI offers unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem, without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements. It enables crypto funds, market makers, and trading desks to trade, stake, borrow, lend, invest, and interact with over 17,000 DeFi protocols and applications.</p>\n<p><a

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Integrate with your hardware wallet:</strong> Enhance your security by connecting MetaMask to hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor from Portfolio, combining the convenience of MetaMask with the robust security of cold storage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Customize privacy settings:</strong> Adjust your privacy settings to your preference, including setting up a custom RPC for specific networks, managing connected sites, and reviewing permissions. Learn more about how to configure your privacy settings <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>9. Participate in staking:</strong> Stake your crypto directly through MetaMask Portfolio, participating in the decision-making processes of various protocols and earning rewards. In Portfolio, there are three options for staking, Validator, Pooled, and <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake?tab=liquid\">Liquid</a>.

Bridge tokens:</strong> Bridging tokens on MetaMask refers to the process of transferring digital assets or tokens from one blockchain network to another using MetaMask as the interface for the transaction. Bridging tokens is a powerful feature in Portfolio that enhances the interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling users to leverage the unique advantages of each network.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1rwvBWk5XU?si=twN-RTUS1qioHW3l\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<h3><strong>Coming soon in Portfolio</strong></h3>\n<br />\n<p>Transfer assets from centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase and Binance directly to your MetaMask wallet, or between different accounts within MetaMask itself, with enhanced security and ease.
