They may not yet fully understand the drivers behind DeFi or Web3, but learned that the asset class cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p>As a result, institutions dominated DeFi transactions in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform. Large institutional transactions, which are transactions above $10M, accounted for <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-defi-adoption-index/\">over 60% of all DeFi transactions</a> over this period.</p>\n<p>Part of the attraction of DeFi for institutions are the high yields offered across the sector, when compared with returns from traditional finance (TradFi) instruments.

While the high yields offered an attractive opportunity for these banks, the regulatory and technology uncertainty involved kept them away from the ecosystem. 2021 changed that. Many investment banks–including Blackrock, BNYMellon, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-goldman-sachs-restarts-cryptocurrency-desk-amid-bitcoin-boom-2021-03-01/\">Goldman Sachs</a>–either revived their crypto desks, or entered the space.</p>\n<p>The year began with the news that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/01/20/blackrock-files-to-add-bitcoin-futures-to-funds/?sh=6f85db693086\">Blackrock had filed with the SEC</a> to add bitcoin exposure to two of its investment funds. The world’s largest asset manager also invested <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-invests-384m-bitcoin-mining-121211742.html\">$384M in bitcoin mining companies</a> last year, its regulatory filings showed. In a push towards greater acceptance of crypto as an investment, <a href=\"https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-release/bny-mellon-forms-new-digital-assets-unit-to-build-industrypercent27s-first-multi-asset-digital-platform-130169.html\">BNY Mellon</a>, the oldest bank in the US, formed a new digital assets unit, to provide services around bitcoin and other digital currencies.</p>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html\">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bitcoin-goldman-is-close-to-offering-bitcoin-to-its-richest-clients.html\">Goldman Sachs</a> decided to offer their wealth management clients access to bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, the European Investment Bank, the investment arm of the European Union, issued its <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/stories/cryptocurrency-blockchain-bonds\">first ever digital bond</a>, worth 100M euros, on public blockchain. Societe Generale, France’s third-largest bank, also proposed to <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/socgen-wants-to-borrow-20m-dai-on-makerdao-using-tokenized-bonds-as-collateral/\">borrow $20M in </a>Dai from MakerDAO, one of the largest DeFI protocols.</p>\n<h2>Retail Banks</h2>\n<p>From calling digital currencies a “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html\">fraud</a>”, to offering custodial services for their digital assets to clients, retail banks have come full circle in their relationship with digital currencies. In 2021, many retail banks either started offering bitcoin exposure, or considering such exposure for clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/04/26/jpmorgan-to-let-clients-invest-in-bitcoin-fund-for-first-time-sources/\">JPMorgan Chase</a> said in January that it may offer some clients the opportunity to invest in bitcoin funds. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-launches-digital-assets-unit-confirming-crypto-plans/602433/\">Citibank</a> launched a digital assets unit offering crypto investment services amid increasing interest from its clients.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan did not just stop at bitcoin funds. Later in the year, it partnered with <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/115087/wells-fargo-jpmorgan-partner-with-nydig-to-launch-bitcoin-funds\">Wells Fargo and NYDIG</a> to offer bitcoin exposure to their respective clients. In addition, JPMorgan launched an <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/05/jpmorgan-launches-in-house-bitcoin-fund-for-private-bank-clients/\">in-house bitcoin fund</a> for its private banking clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bofa-global-research-launches-coverage-of-digital-assets-301391753.html\">Bank of America</a> launched a research unit to look into digital assets, while <a href=\"https://ir.usbank.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-bank-announces-new-cryptocurrency-custody-services\">US Bank</a> launched cryptocurrency custody services.</p>\n<h2>DeFi Projects</h2>\n<p>In 2021, the walls between the DeFi and the TradFi worlds became increasingly porous. While institutions tested crypto waters, DeFi companies welcomed both venture capital, and human resources from the TradFi world.</p>\n<p>Crypto exchange <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104870/ftx-us-former-citadel-securities-brett-harrison-crypto-exchange\">FTX brought in Brett Harrison</a> as its first president. Harrison joined FTX from Citadel Securities, a leading global market maker. The company also <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/ftx-crypto-exchange-25-billion-valuation-74d4f9ee-073c-45fc-a888-ea05536d6f9d.html\">hit $25B in valuation</a>, when it raised $900M in July 2021.</p>\n<p>In another vote of trust for DeFi, crypto custodian Anchorage’s proposal to <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/54074/anchorage-first-federal-charter-digital-asset-bank\">become a digital bank</a> was approved by the US finance regulator in January 2021. Anchorage ended the year at a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-350-million-at-3-billion-valuation/\">$3B valuation</a> after it raised $350M in December 2021.</p>\n<p>2021 was also a blockbuster year for ConsenSys. ConsenSys ended the year with a $3.2B valuation. The company’s famous crypto wallet, MetaMask, continued on its growth trajectory, reaching <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-21-million-maus-as-consensys-raises-200-million-to-make-web3-universally-easy-to-use-access-and-build-on/\">over 21M users</a> as of November 2021. <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-bitgo-qredo-and-cactus-custody/\">MetaMask Institutional partnered</a> with three leading custodians: BitGo, Qredo, and Cactus Custody to support institutional firms engaging with on-chain protocols.</p>\n<p>In another first for DeFi, Swiss digital bank Sygnum said it would <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sygnum-becomes-first-bank-in-the-world-to-offer-eth2-staking\">allow its customers to stake their ETH</a> through its institutional banking platform. Crypto trading platform <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cryptocurrency-firm-bullish-go-public-9-bln-spac-deal-2021-07-09/\">Bullish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/07/08/usdc-stablecoin-backer-circle-to-go-public-in-45b-spac-deal/\">Circle</a> announced plans to go public via SPACs, while USDC-backer Circle also planned to become a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-plans-to-become-a-full-reserve-national-digital-currency-bank\">full-reserve digital bank</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Time for DeFi has Come</h2>\n<p>In 2021, many leading institutions shifted away from skepticism and took meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem with business model pivots and capital deployment.</p>\n<p>A whopping 90% of crypto’s largest deals happened in 2021, according to <a href=\"https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf\">a Messari report</a>. And this 90% did not even include Coinbase’s direct listing, which valued the crypto exchange at nearly $86B.</p>\n<p>These strides are strong indicators of the upwards journey of institutional interest in 2022. According to an Intertrust survey, hedge funds plan to hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f8044bf-8f0f-46b4-9fb7-6d0eba723017\">an average of 7% of their holdings</a> in cryptocurrencies by 2026. The long-term growth opportunity for DeFi can be gauged from the fact that the market cap of all DeFi protocols ($149B at the end of December 2021) is less than 1% of that of global banks—highlighting enormous room for growth.</p>\n<p>Organizations can embark on their journey into DeFi with MetaMask Institutional (MMI), a DeFi wallet and Web3 gateway built for institutions. MMI offers unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem, without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements. It enables crypto funds, market makers, and trading desks to trade, stake, borrow, lend, invest, and interact with over 17,000 DeFi protocols and applications.</p>\n<p><a
