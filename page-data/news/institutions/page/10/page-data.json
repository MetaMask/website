Simran Jagdev","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Crypto adoption among institutional investors has been on the rise. Over the last two years, many leading institutions have taken meaningful steps into the DeFi and Web3 ecosystem by pivoting their business model to focus on Web3, and by deploying capital into the ecosystem. According to a CoinShares report, institutions <a href=\"https://www.binance.com/en/news/top/6693616\">invested $9.3B</a> into the crypto market in 2021, up 36% from 2020.</p>\n<p>The increasing institutional interest in crypto can be attributed to the growing maturity of the technology, as well as the changes in the ecosystem that have had a profound impact on institutional adoption. One such fundamental change, called <a href=\"https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/the-merge/\">the Merge</a>, to the Ethereum ecosystem is set to occur mid-September.</p>\n<p>The Merge will transition the Ethereum blockchain network from the energy-intensive Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to the more sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The move to PoS will increase the security of the Ethereum network, and set it up for future scalability. This is likely to make institutions more keen to engage with the Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In our recently released ‘<strong>Impact of the Merge on Institutions</strong>’ report, we discuss in detail the opportunities that the Merge will create for institutions in the world of Web3. Written by <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a> and the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/insights/cryptoeconomic-research/\">ConsenSys Cryptoeconomic Research</a> team, the report also explores the factors, such as <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/why-ethereum-is-poised-for-growth-a-look-at-network-activity/\">network activity</a>, <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/why-ethereum-is-poised-for-growth-a-look-at-network-security/\">security</a>, and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/why-ethereum-is-poised-for-growth-a-look-at-network-valuation/\">valuation</a>, which are setting Ethereum up for long-term growth and success. You can find the full report <strong><a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/impact-of-the-merge-on-institutions-insight-report-sept-2022\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In this post, we take a look at how the Merge will impact institutions.</p>\n<h2>Reduced Carbon Footprint</h2>\n<p>The shift to PoS means a 99.95% decrease in energy consumption due to the removal of PoW physical GPU (graphics processing unit) node processors and their replacement by lightweight servers running validator clients. The reduction of Ethereum’s carbon footprint will be significant for institutional investors, especially traditional organizations who need to meet certain environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates in their portfolios. After the Merge, there will be an opportunity to obtain real yield without compromising on sustainability goals.</p>\n<p>Through this lens, transacting on Ethereum may look more attractive than on other Layer 1 chains that do not offer the same energy efficiency.</p>\n<h2>New and Attractive Staking Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Staking contracts will continue to follow the staking vs total value locked (TVL) % earning curve. Individuals and institutions can earn rewards through staking for participating in network consensus. Investors are likely to obtain positive real yield, estimated to be between 5.5-13.2%. In a world of negative real yields, the positive real yield will make ETH staking a particularly attractive opportunity. In addition, liquid staking opportunities created by centralized services like Lido will continue to lower barriers to entry by allowing investors to stake their ETH while retaining liquidity in the form of ETH derivatives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2MsjWMcBBwtfKsdfvL5LhO/5d863bfeeaf2d949e5994b20bf188625/Eth-staked.png\" alt=\"Eth-staked\">\nFigure 1. Total ETH Staked vs Estimated APR\nSource: Staking Rewards</p>\n<h2>Deflationary Supply of ETH</h2>\n<p>Reduced ETH issuance and increased burns not only caps, but systematically reduces ETH supply. The reduced supply will put deflationary pressure on ETH and diminish the risk of token price dropping to zero. For institutions, ETH may become a more attractive asset, as reduced supply may lead to an increase in value.</p>\n<h2>Improved Security</h2>\n<h3>Enhanced Decentralization</h3>\n<p>The democratized participation of the PoS system produces enhanced decentralization, and thereby a dramatic increase in the cost of attacking the Ethereum blockchain. As of August 2022, more that 13.3M ETH had been staked by over 415,000 validators—This ensures the near impossibility of attack. With these numbers, a 51% attack would cost over $11B.</p>\n<h3>Cross-team Ecosystem Collaboration</h3>\n<p>The Ethereum network is fueled by a diverse ecosystem of participants building together on an open-source framework, on a global scale. Collaboration across the protocol ecosystem leads to fewer centralized points of failure. This ensures confidence in the community to build and execute.</p>\n<p>These points each provide stronger security guarantees for both institutional and retail participation.</p>\n<h2>Ecosystem Growth</h2>\n<p>On-chain applications and Layer 2 (L2) solutions will likely leverage the above improved security conditions and multiply on top of Ethereum. This could produce another explosion in the number of applications deployed, and opportunities created for institutions.</p>\n<h2>Client Diversity and Interoperability</h2>\n<p>Ethereum is the network with the highest number of live client instances that can fully interoperate. Integration can occur with any major coding language and in collaboration with different companies. The breadth of options will allow institutions to choose how they want to interact with Web3. Each one can choose to rely on client(s) that fit with their precise requirements.</p>\n<p>Beyond these general outcomes, we expect to see the Merge impact different kinds of institutions in different ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Crypto funds</strong> are likely to diversify their investment strategy with protocol staking for base returns. ETH and ETH derivatives, such as for liquid staking, offer liquid yield returns in addition to other farming strategies funds may deploy.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading firms</strong> are likely to see short-term gains with high-volume trades and position adjustments leading up to the Merge. Volatile markets provide opportunities for market makers.</p>\n<p><strong>For pension funds and endowments</strong>, 401k spot exposure to cryptocurrency assets may expand to tokens representing derivatives of these assets. There may be an adjustment of positions for long term returns.</p>\n<p><strong>If L2s and other protocols</strong> use ETH to settle their transactions to Ethereum, then these projects may have already been buying ETH through the bear market in order to operate on the network for future launches. At the time of this report, this demand may have already been priced in.</p>\n<p>As ETH dramatically reduces its carbon footprint, <strong>traditional organizations and financial institutions</strong> may look into opportunities to get exposure to DeFi services. This may start with NFT drops or embedding wallet features into banking applications for stablecoin custody and conversion. Further, financial institutions may add stablecoins onto their balance sheets and attract portfolio managers to build exposure to yield farming opportunities on DeFi protocols launched on Ethereum.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A look at Ethereum’s roadmap makes it clear that the community is building the network and its technology for the long term. The Merge is a step in the right direction. However, it is only the first one in the journey towards a better Ethereum. We discuss the planned upgrades to Ethereum that will follow the Merge in the full <a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/impact-of-the-merge-on-institutions-insight-report-sept-2022\">Impact of the Merge on Institutions report</a>.</p>\n<p>On September 12th, the key contributors will discuss the report’s findings on our “Breaking Down the Merge for Institutions” webinar. You can register for it <a href=\"https://pages.consensys.net/breaking-down-the-merge-for-institutions-webinar-sept-2022\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>A commitment to continuous improvement of the network and the technology powering Ethereum is a powerful way that it is able to attract increasing institutional interest. Strong institutional appetite for the ecosystem despite current geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, and the recent market volatility points to that fact.</p>\n<p>Financial institutions—investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays, hedge funds like Citadel Securities and Point72 Ventures, and retail banks such as Banco Santander and Itau Unibanco—are putting their money in crypto, or furthering their plans to offer crypto investment options to their clients. As the Ethereum community continues to build through the bear market, we believe that the future is bright for institutional DeFi.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Disclaimer: ConsenSys Software Inc. is not a registered or licensed advisor or broker.

The market dislocations of the first quarter only accelerated. In addition, we have experienced events over the last 90 days that are bound to have far-reaching impacts for years to come. Yet, if anything, this quarterly update should provide an overview of just how bright the institutional Web3 future is and what MMI is doing to build it.</p>\n<p>Before dedicating what is now the majority of my career to the art and science of product and user experience, I spent seven years as a global macro investment manager. My career started in 2008, a profound time to cut one’s teeth. To this day, I have countless stories of that period. From seeing experienced finance veterans in deep states of paralysis and shock, unable to make decisions, to observing the ostrich effect in action as trading desks changed television channels, from CNBC to the Beijing Olympics. I experienced financial instruments, markets, and market fundamentals breaking in ways no one thought possible.</p>\n<p>Starting an investment management career in 2008 felt like arriving at a seat at the table to a game that was ending. My mentor at the time was a deeply experienced macro commodity trading advisor and equity trader. Hence, risk management and Austrian economics were drilled into me from a young age. Most people in crypto have an origin story, and this period deeply contributed to mine. Markets change, asset classes change and financial instruments change.

No, Web3 is not having its 2008 moment. Extreme leverage, coupled with opaque black box balance sheets, and obfuscated risk positions are the consequences of centralised entities. Coupling this with human behaviour and cognitive biases, makes the perfect argument for the importance of decentralisation and Web3.</p>\n<p>As Naval Ravikant noted, “The test of any good system is to build the system and turn it over to your enemies to run for ten years.”  Web3 provides a better system. DeFi is not just an asset class for institutions to allocate to. It’s a new financial system for the Web3 economy. A system that offers more transparency, digital authority and a fundamentally better way to create, store and transfer value. With value accruing to the contributors and token holders while offering near instant-settlement.</p>\n<p>Crypto is truly filled with, and keeps attracting, the most talented and brilliant builders. Anyone who spends time in this space soon recognises that the optimism and innovation cycles are second to none. Hence, every bull market drives greater adoption and every bear market brings with it the next wave of paradigm-shifting innovations. Arriving into Web3 in July 2022 would, and should, feel like arriving at a game that is just starting.</p>\n<p>It is MMI’s mission to bridge every organisation in the world into Web3. We exist to be of unrivalled value and service to our users. Hence, we follow product, design and user research principles that define how we build products from zero to one that our users can’t live without. We believe safety, security and trust are some of the first-principles to ensure mainstream organisation adoption. We recognize as far as Web3 has come, we have much to do to ensure that we build products and user experiences that drive the crossing of the chasm. And we’re just getting started.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A special time, in a special place with a special group people” – Pat Berarducci</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second quarter of 2022 was a profound period for MMI. Despite crypto markets falling 60% on average, we continued to grow double digits week-on-week throughout the period. In this quarter, we <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">announced our next set of custodian partners</a>; attended the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMInstitutional/status/1522315725020434432\">Paris Blockchain Summit</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMInstitutional/status/1519358573469265921\">Crypto Bahamas</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMInstitutional/status/1527312104037883906\">Permissionless</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMInstitutional/status/1536370447721254912\">Consensus</a>, Battlefin, NFT.NYC and ETH NYC; and won a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MMInstitutional/status/1542213992348848130\">Hedgeweek award</a>. We ran our first Twitter space and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeaAkNICeng\">spoke on several different podcasts</a>. We also held the first MMI Offsite. Most importantly and fundamentally, we shipped meaningful features with great user experiences to solve the most salient needs for our user. Hence, this update reflects all the incredible work of the entire MMI team. A special group of people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Step 1 is to build something that users love.” – Sam Altman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the quarter, we delivered on several important initiatives across the experience teams building MMI. Within our wallet and custodian integrations team, we completed two custodian integrations <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">as we continue to work with world class partners</a> in different jurisdictions offering different key management solutions to cater to the different needs of all organisations. We also launched our integration with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/mmi-and-gnosis-safe-a-partnership-made-in-dao-heaven/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">Safe</a>, offering unrivalled access to Web3 and treasury management with our portfolio dashboard for decentralised autonomous organisations (<a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">DAOs</a>), a user group we are extremely passionate and excited about.</p>\n<p>On top of a range of user experience and design updates in the extension, we also launched <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/mmi-introduces-new-reporting-features-for-organizations/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">transaction notes</a>. This feature gives organisations the ability to provide notes and context around their transactions. These notes will appear within custodian user interfaces to assist stakeholders in the signing process. From our product discovery process, we found that a continued pain point for our users was the extra layer of required communication through third-party channels to describe and provide assurance around a transaction. Transaction notes eliminate the additional time users spend to provide details of their trades, and simplify the overall process. Over the quarter we recorded engagement and retention metrics that were over three times the industry-average.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3rXESJuH0M6HN4HdVGM1ue/7aa140f791718c5832ca62162285562d/MMI-Transaction-Notes-v2.png\" alt=\"MMI-Transaction-Notes-v2\"></p>\n<p>Within the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/portfolio/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">MMI Portfolio Dashboard</a>, we rolled out a range of features and updates. In terms of a delightful user experience, we increased loading speed by tenfold, increased our protocol coverage, and improved the asset allocation layout. We shipped portfolio filtering at the account and protocol level, and added protocol and sector breakdowns to provide richer context around a portfolio’s positions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7dtsbmbKXI5mOviXjVC4S2/37ab41e68621a827ed0713fb9dd14034/MMI-Portfolio-Dashboard-v2.png\" alt=\"MMI-Portfolio-Dashboard-v2\"></p>\n<p>Our biggest focus for the quarter however was to address two of the biggest pain points we hear from our users — a fragmented NFT experience for the institutional user, and reporting.</p>\n<p>We believe NFTs is a profoundly important sector within Web3. Yet, the institutional user experience is completely broken. Organisations are often multi-custodian, have multiple accounts per custodian, hold multiple NFTs per account, and then transact or use multiple different marketplaces. This results in fragmentation at every layer of the stack.</p>\n<p>Over the last quarter we spent weeks speaking with different organisations that buy, hold and trade NFTs to understand how they are allocating to this digital asset. We dove into where their pain points lay and what was the paramount information that drove their day-to-day processes and decision making. Accordingly, we built <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/nft/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">MMI’s NFT Tracking View</a>, and launched it at <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/events-and-conferences/8-side-events-you-cant-miss-during-nft-nyc/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">ConsenSys Connect</a>’s event in Times Square. The MMI NFT tracking view unifies all the fragmentation institutions face, providing a consolidated view of all their NFT holdings, across custodians, accounts and marketplaces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/64ruq6DdWWdgFlDOStHXDa/39617bf16c05cefabdd031dab6e1ca38/MMI-NFT-Tracking-View-v2.png\" alt=\"MMI-NFT-Tracking-View-v2\"></p>\n<p>Reporting is another key, and difficult aspect of Web3. We meet with our users daily and hear about the hours they spend explaining their transactions to their third-party service providers. Valuations are done with manual screenshots and transaction history downloaded from block explorers. Reporting and valuations also closely ties into profit and loss, net asset values and performance. Today, there are very few providers that provide accurate Web3 reporting capabilities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1HU56D69L4lYbUqsPrHBkb/718ba819de385905db10b942926ae986/MMI-Snapshots-v2.png\" alt=\"MMI-Snapshots-v2\"></p>\n<p>Over Q2, we built and launched valuation and read-only data sharing capabilities in our <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/mmi-introduces-new-reporting-features-for-organizations/?utm_source=mmi-blog&#x26;utm_medium=blogpost&#x26;utm_campaign=q2-2022-review\">portfolio snapshot feature</a>,  providing accurate valuations across all EVMs in token, DeFi positions and NFTs. Our portfolio snapshot feature automatically creates weekly, monthly and quarterly valuations and transaction history that can be shared in read-only format to third-party service providers. With data also downloadable to CSV, it also lays the foundation of building our Web3 attribution capabilities in the upcoming quarter.</p>\n<p>Given the current state of crypto markets, and the start of the summer in the US and Europe, I suspect the next quarter might be subdued compared to previous years. Nonetheless, MMI will have important product updates, along with several public announcements. As we continue to focus on bridging every organisation on the earth into Web3, we believe now is the absolute best time to build.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":"Ensuring MetaMask is safe, secure, and stable enough for continued viral growth | Q2.2022","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"7sa6F4zNLmV7HfA5z26O7H","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Institutional Introduces New Reporting Features for Organizations","slug":"metamask-institutional-introduces-new-reporting-features-for-organizations","subtitle":"To help organizations save time, decrease the likelihood of error, and make monitoring and reporting easier, MMI is introducing Snapshots and Transaction Notes.","image":{"title":"MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=285&h=189&q=80&fm=webp 285w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=570&h=378&q=80&fm=webp 570w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=webp 1140w","sizes":"(min-width: 1140px) 1140px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=285&h=189&q=80&fm=png 285w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=570&h=378&q=80&fm=png 570w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4klbX2HGZOXdlZPDvb09OP/f577b707ddc8bdce2c8ba4adbd44b31a/MMI-Introducing-New-Reporting-Features-for-Organizations-1.png?w=1140&h=755&q=80&fm=png 1140w","sizes":"(min-width: 1140px) 1140px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1272}},"publishDate":"July 7, 2022","authors":[{"name":"Yanlin Fu","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":null}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The first half of 2022 hasn’t been easy. Macroeconomic and geopolitical events, along with what’s been happening within the DeFi ecosystem have led to a lot of uncertainties. Nevertheless, MetaMask Institutional (MMI) continues to deliver new and important features. In the first six months of the year, we have launched:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-introduces-multichain-capabilities/\">Multi-chain capabilities</a> for custodian accounts</li>\n<li>The first iteration of the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI Portfolio Dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">Partnerships</a> with four new custodians</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-nft-tracking-within-its-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">NFT tracking capabilities</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>What’s next? MetaMask Institutional now has new reporting features available within its Portfolio Dashboard and browser extension.</p>\n<p>Typically, organizations spend well over 10 hours a month to capture data across various portfolios and protocols. Funds set reminders to take screenshots of balances across different protocols, then use these to provide valuations to their administrators. To help organizations save time, decrease the likelihood of error, and make monitoring and reporting of holdings easier, MMI is introducing Snapshots and Transaction Notes.</p>\n<h2>MMI Snapshots</h2>\n<p>Snapshots allows organizations to generate a read-only view of their trades over a given timeframe on the MMI Portfolio Dashboard. This read-only view highlights the organization’s  positions at a point in time, along with the transactions for that time period. This new feature takes daily snapshots of an organization’s holdings, which are consolidated into reports viewable by time period, and allow them to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>View by time period; weekly, monthly, and quarterly</li>\n<li>View all portfolio items including, all assets, assets allocated to lending, borrowing, yield farming, staking, NFTs, rewards, and transaction history</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these Snapshots generates a unique link, which can then be exported and shared with the fund admins, LPs, or any third-party provider. Organizations can collaborate, get detailed reports, track internally, and share them easily with different teams.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/23275AqrzJv6YctYDZuTiP/1cc4852c80d166470aef4df07592f92e/4100-Portfolio-snapshot.png\" alt=\"4100-Portfolio-snapshot\"></p>\n<p>Snapshots works by taking daily snapshots. Therefore, to view these reports by time period, say weekly, monthly or quarterly, it will take time to populate with the first weekly snapshot available in users’ portfolio dashboards on July 8. MMI’s Snapshots feature is currently only available on the Portfolio Dashboard dapp.</p>\n<h2>MMI Transaction Notes</h2>\n<p>Transaction Notes allows initiators to include ‘reference notes’ or comments they would like to include for each trade. These notes are stored as transaction details, which will be sent to the custodian so other transaction approvers can see the text when they receive the notification. Think of it as a way of letting other users know what this transaction is about – making for easy viewing, and letting users keep track of all the ins and outs. This eliminates the additional time users need to spend to provide context and details of their trades to their fund admins.</p>\n<p>Organizations can now find a new “Note” tab on the confirmation dialog within the MMI Extension. This allows the user to add transaction details in the text box. When the transaction is submitted, the custodian receives all details including this note for approval or rejection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/JIM95o0vy2YuoOc45HBMH/12ba74ce70cb95ae0711bf68b1722d87/Screenshot-2022-07-01-at-15.11.28.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2022-07-01-at-15.11.28\"></p>\n<p>The Transaction Notes feature is currently only available within the “transaction details” in the MMI extension, and in the browser extension, but will soon be available on the Portfolio Dashboard.</p>\n<p>MMI Snapshots and Transaction Notes are live, and users will gain access as custodians roll out support for these features.</p>\n<p><strong>Eager to learn more?

With this partnership, MMI expands its cryptocurrency custody offerings to integrate custody options for Web3-native organizations such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>\n<p>Gnosis Safe is one of the most popular digital asset management platforms for DAOs, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-institutional-announces-the-integration-of-hex-trust-gk8-and-parfin-to-broaden-organizational-reach-and-gnosis-safe-to-streamline-dao-experiences/\">over $90B</a> worth of assets stored in self custody. Many DAOs, including Uniswap, Maker DAO, Aave, and Bit DAO use Gnosis Safe for their custody needs.</p>\n<p>DAOs prefer Gnosis Safe for its multi-sig security feature, which provides them with additional security to deploy funds. Using this feature, DAOs can ensure that multiple stakeholders sign off on a transaction before funds are released.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a deeper look into Gnosis’ multi-sig security, and why DAOs need it.</p>\n<h2>DAOs and their Unique Custody Needs</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/\">DAO</a> is a community-led organization that is designed to decentralize control. There is no central decision-making authority, and all important matters are decided on by all members of the DAO.</p>\n<p>Individual DAO members create a proposal such as those related to functioning, treasury allocations, even the future of the DAO. All members of the DAO can then vote on these proposals using their governance tokens. When a pre-decided consensus is reached on a proposal, then it is accepted and enforced by the rules coded within a smart contract.</p>\n<p>Since there is no central authority that is signing off on decisions, DAOs require multiple members to be signatories to their transactions. This is imperative to maintain the decentralization that is core to the structure of DAOs. This is where Gnosis Safe’s multi-sig feature is best suited for DAOs to manage their crypto transactions since it  requires multiple members to confirm the transaction before it is executed. This adds an extra layer of security to the DAO treasury and prevents unauthorized use of DAO funds.</p>\n<h2>MMI and Gnosis Safe Give DAOs Unrivaled Access to DeFi</h2>\n<p>Currently, DAOs can use Gnosis Safe to manage their funds in two ways. First, they can transact directly with the Gnosis Safe wallet and their ecosystem of apps called <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-gnosis-safe-apps-faef908f69c6\">Safe apps</a>. Second, they can connect their wallet of choice with Gnosis Safe using <a href=\"https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4356253-walletconnect-safe-app\">WalletConnect</a>. To do so, they have to scan a QR code to connect WalletConnect with the dapp they wish to use. This process is cumbersome, and also limits the DAOs access to the DeFi ecosystem to the dapps and protocols that WalletConnect supports.</p>\n<p>With MMI’s partnership with Gnosis, DAOs have a third, more convenient way to connect with DeFi. This gives them unrivaled access to the DeFi ecosystem because MMI connects to over 17,000 dapps. MMI also allows DAOs to join MetaMask’s 20M monthly active users across the globe in accessing Web3. In addition, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI’s DeFi and Web3 portfolio dashboard</a>, DAOs can get a holistic overview of their portfolio, its performance, individual assets, and historical transactions.</p>\n<p>“Gnosis Safe is a foundational cornerstone of our ecosystem—an unmatched and trusted platform on which most DAOs rely to secure and manage their digital assets. This integration, therefore, brings together these two important elements</p>\n<p>for organisations; unrivaled access and trusted security. We are, therefore, thrilled by this partnership and the further collaboration between Gnosis Safe and ConsenSys,” <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/metamask-institutional-x-gnosis-safe-45fc852b4186\">says Johann Bornman</a>, Global Product Lead for MMI.</p>\n<h2>MMI and Decentralization</h2>\n<p>The partnership between MMI and Gnosis Safe also strengthens ConsenSys’ commitment towards Web3-native organizations, and towards Ethereum’s goal of decentralization.</p>\n<p>A decentralized web is a cornerstone of ConsenSys’ product philosophy. For example, the company has been enabling wider participation in ecosystem governance through <a href=\"https://consensys.net/solutions/daos-and-web3-governance/\">DAO creation and participation</a>. There currently are three DAOs – Village DAO, Education DAO, and Sandbox DAO – that are powered by ConsenSys.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, ConsenSys promotes decentralization through its products. Metamask is the first wallet to offer extensibility to users, with <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-metamask-flask-enables-developers-to-build-the-latest-technical-innovations-in-web3/\">Metamask Flask</a>. Flask is a proving ground for developers to roll out experimental features in Metamask.
