In this post, we'll explore the growing demand for crypto investment from institutional investors, the technological innovations supported by the government, and the encouraging regulatory policies in the region. At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we've also spoken with thousands of capital allocators in the past years and learnt about the challenges they face when accessing web3. We'll discuss how the MMI platform has helped them overcome these challenges and become an essential tool for any enterprise accessing web3.</p>\n<h1>Growing Investment Demand in APAC</h1>\n<p>Despite the bear market in 2022-2023, the crypto industry has received a vote of confidence from the global private and public sectors. Hedge funds, financial organizations, and Fortune 100 companies increasingly invest in blockchain strategies. According to <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-2023-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report.html\">PwC’s 2023 Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report</a>, traditional hedge funds remained confident about crypto’s long-term value proposition despite market volatility.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.ocorian.com/press-releases/family-offices-turn-crypto-client-demand-grows\">2023 research</a> revealed that 90% of family offices include crypto and digital assets in their investment strategies. In the APAC region, crypto has become a significant new asset class. In fact, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/among-affluent-asian-investors-52-hold-crypto-survey-finds\">52% of affluent Asian investors hold crypto</a>. Furthermore, several financial institutions in Hong Kong, including <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/10/ubs-groups-wealthy-clients-can-now-trade-some-crypto-etfs-in-hong-kong-bloomberg/\">UBS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/\">HSBC</a>, are reportedly allowing their wealthy customers to trade crypto ETFs. Hong Kong’s Securities and Exchange Commission is also exploring <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/261600/hong-kong-considers-allowing-retail-access-to-spot-crypto-etfs-report\">allowing retail investors to buy spot crypto ETFs</a>.</p>\n<h1>Technological Innovation and Government Support</h1>\n<p>In 2023, central banks and financial institutions in the region have taken a more progressive stance, exploring blockchain technology and recognizing the benefits of integrating this technology into the existing financial infrastructure. The <a href=\"https://www.ledgerinsights.com/global-layer-1-gl1-blockchain-tokenization-bny-dbs-jpm-mufg/\">Monetary Authority of Singapore launched Project Guardian</a> partnered with 17 key financial institutions. The project successfully piloted cross-border currency settlement on public blockchain, tokenized deposit and off-chain asset tokenization. Similarly, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the <a href=\"https://www.financeasia.com/article/hkma-publishes-findings-of-e-hkd-pilot/492448\">eHKD pilot</a>. Findings from both programs have highlighted the benefits of blockchain technology and have paved the way for further adoptions.</p>\n<h1>Encouraging Regulatory Policies</h1>\n<p>The increasing popularity of digital assets in APAC has also been bolstered by the growing regulatory certainty in the region.</p>\n<p>In Hong Kong, the government <a href=\"https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/hong-kongs-new-virtual-asset-regime-what-you-need-to-know.html\">enforced a Centralized Exchange (CEX) license framework</a> to facilitate greater market participation. Banks operating in the city, such as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/hsbc-standard-chartered-face-pressure-hong-kong-take-crypto-clients-ft-2023-06-15/\">HSBC and Standard Chartered</a>, have been encouraged by the government to cater to the needs of licensed crypto exchanges. The city is also looking to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/hong-kong-eyes-stablecoin-regulatory-regime-by-2024/\">introduce a regulatory framework</a> around stablecoins by the end of 2024. Similarly, countries like Singapore and Japan are moving towards defining a more concrete crypto framework.</p>\n<p>With regulatory green lights and growing demand, the last piece of the puzzle for mainstream institutional adoption is enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure, and MetaMask Institutional is key to this infrastructure.</p>\n<h1>The Role of MetaMask Institutional</h1>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) bridges the gap between traditional financial structures and blockchain technology. The current blockchain infrastructure for enterprises can be fragmented and complex, often requiring multiple tools for custody, reporting, and risk management which results in inefficiencies in operation and high costs.</p>\n<p>MMI offers a complete ecosystem that consolidates all essential enterprise services in an easily manageable package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Seamless Custody-DeFi experience:</strong> MMI maintains parity with the retail MetaMask and is natively integrated with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">more than a dozen</a> best-in-class licensed custodians, custody technology providers and smart contract wallets. This allows institutions to pick one or a combination of different custody stacks that works best for them while having MMI streamline the trade flow on-chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4AwotFcV552DmFqlRsuzQU/5e07edc1c69d1dae90510ce8403bea9e/mmi-custodian-map-with_mpcvault-dec_2023.png\" alt=\"mmi-custodian-map-with mpcvault-dec 2023\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enterprise-grade portfolio management system:</strong> Organizations can get an overview of token balances, yield farming, staking, NFTs and unclaimed rewards across all Seed Phrase Accounts, Hardware wallets and custody and self-custody accounts connected to the MMI wallet extension.</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio Management and Reporting:</strong> With our best-in-class Portfolio Management and Reporting, organizations can accurately track yield farming, staking, liquidity provision, NFTs and unclaimed rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2STGOj2jZcRtPgDT2OroH2/1f744bf1c3811cddfc71e0ebc91e4ff9/unnamed-22.png\" alt=\"Staking marketplace screenshot\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy access to other web3 primitives:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>MMI’s Staking Marketplace offers unified terms and conditions across the best-in-class staking providers so that users can get the best staking deal and stake with just 1 click.</li>\n<li>MMI Swaps allows users to easily swap crypto and exchange digital tokens across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
