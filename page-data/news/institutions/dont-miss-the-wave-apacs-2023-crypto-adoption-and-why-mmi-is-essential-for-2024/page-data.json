In this post, we'll explore the growing demand for crypto investment from institutional investors, the technological innovations supported by the government, and the encouraging regulatory policies in the region. At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we've also spoken with thousands of capital allocators in the past years and learnt about the challenges they face when accessing web3. We'll discuss how the MMI platform has helped them overcome these challenges and become an essential tool for any enterprise accessing web3.</p>\n<h1>Growing Investment Demand in APAC</h1>\n<p>Despite the bear market in 2022-2023, the crypto industry has received a vote of confidence from the global private and public sectors. Hedge funds, financial organizations, and Fortune 100 companies increasingly invest in blockchain strategies. According to <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-2023-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report.html\">PwC’s 2023 Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report</a>, traditional hedge funds remained confident about crypto’s long-term value proposition despite market volatility.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.ocorian.com/press-releases/family-offices-turn-crypto-client-demand-grows\">2023 research</a> revealed that 90% of family offices include crypto and digital assets in their investment strategies. In the APAC region, crypto has become a significant new asset class. In fact, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/among-affluent-asian-investors-52-hold-crypto-survey-finds\">52% of affluent Asian investors hold crypto</a>. Furthermore, several financial institutions in Hong Kong, including <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/10/ubs-groups-wealthy-clients-can-now-trade-some-crypto-etfs-in-hong-kong-bloomberg/\">UBS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/\">HSBC</a>, are reportedly allowing their wealthy customers to trade crypto ETFs. Hong Kong’s Securities and Exchange Commission is also exploring <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/261600/hong-kong-considers-allowing-retail-access-to-spot-crypto-etfs-report\">allowing retail investors to buy spot crypto ETFs</a>.</p>\n<h1>Technological Innovation and Government Support</h1>\n<p>In 2023, central banks and financial institutions in the region have taken a more progressive stance, exploring blockchain technology and recognizing the benefits of integrating this technology into the existing financial infrastructure. The <a href=\"https://www.ledgerinsights.com/global-layer-1-gl1-blockchain-tokenization-bny-dbs-jpm-mufg/\">Monetary Authority of Singapore launched Project Guardian</a> partnered with 17 key financial institutions. The project successfully piloted cross-border currency settlement on public blockchain, tokenized deposit and off-chain asset tokenization. Similarly, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the <a href=\"https://www.financeasia.com/article/hkma-publishes-findings-of-e-hkd-pilot/492448\">eHKD pilot</a>. Findings from both programs have highlighted the benefits of blockchain technology and have paved the way for further adoptions.</p>\n<h1>Encouraging Regulatory Policies</h1>\n<p>The increasing popularity of digital assets in APAC has also been bolstered by the growing regulatory certainty in the region.</p>\n<p>In Hong Kong, the government <a href=\"https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/hong-kongs-new-virtual-asset-regime-what-you-need-to-know.html\">enforced a Centralized Exchange (CEX) license framework</a> to facilitate greater market participation. Banks operating in the city, such as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/hsbc-standard-chartered-face-pressure-hong-kong-take-crypto-clients-ft-2023-06-15/\">HSBC and Standard Chartered</a>, have been encouraged by the government to cater to the needs of licensed crypto exchanges. The city is also looking to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/hong-kong-eyes-stablecoin-regulatory-regime-by-2024/\">introduce a regulatory framework</a> around stablecoins by the end of 2024. Similarly, countries like Singapore and Japan are moving towards defining a more concrete crypto framework.</p>\n<p>With regulatory green lights and growing demand, the last piece of the puzzle for mainstream institutional adoption is enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure, and MetaMask Institutional is key to this infrastructure.</p>\n<h1>The Role of MetaMask Institutional</h1>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) bridges the gap between traditional financial structures and blockchain technology. The current blockchain infrastructure for enterprises can be fragmented and complex, often requiring multiple tools for custody, reporting, and risk management which results in inefficiencies in operation and high costs.</p>\n<p>MMI offers a complete ecosystem that consolidates all essential enterprise services in an easily manageable package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Seamless Custody-DeFi experience:</strong> MMI maintains parity with the retail MetaMask and is natively integrated with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">more than a dozen</a> best-in-class licensed custodians, custody technology providers and smart contract wallets. This allows institutions to pick one or a combination of different custody stacks that works best for them while having MMI streamline the trade flow on-chain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4AwotFcV552DmFqlRsuzQU/5e07edc1c69d1dae90510ce8403bea9e/mmi-custodian-map-with_mpcvault-dec_2023.png\" alt=\"mmi-custodian-map-with mpcvault-dec 2023\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enterprise-grade portfolio management system:</strong> Organizations can get an overview of token balances, yield farming, staking, NFTs and unclaimed rewards across all Seed Phrase Accounts, Hardware wallets and custody and self-custody accounts connected to the MMI wallet extension.</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio Management and Reporting:</strong> With our best-in-class Portfolio Management and Reporting, organizations can accurately track yield farming, staking, liquidity provision, NFTs and unclaimed rewards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2STGOj2jZcRtPgDT2OroH2/1f744bf1c3811cddfc71e0ebc91e4ff9/unnamed-22.png\" alt=\"Staking marketplace screenshot\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy access to other web3 primitives:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>MMI’s Staking Marketplace offers unified terms and conditions across the best-in-class staking providers so that users can get the best staking deal and stake with just 1 click.</li>\n<li>MMI Swaps allows users to easily swap crypto and exchange digital tokens across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

A common vulnerability in the ecosystem is malicious signature requests, which lead unsuspecting users to authorize transactions that compromise their assets. This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.
