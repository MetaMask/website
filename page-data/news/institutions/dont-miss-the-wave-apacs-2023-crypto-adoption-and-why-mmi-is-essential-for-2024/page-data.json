In this post, we'll explore the growing demand for crypto investment from institutional investors, the technological innovations supported by the government, and the encouraging regulatory policies in the region. At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we've also spoken with thousands of capital allocators in the past years and learnt about the challenges they face when accessing web3. We'll discuss how the MMI platform has helped them overcome these challenges and become an essential tool for any enterprise accessing web3.</p>\n<h1>Growing Investment Demand in APAC</h1>\n<p>Despite the bear market in 2022-2023, the crypto industry has received a vote of confidence from the global private and public sectors. Hedge funds, financial organizations, and Fortune 100 companies increasingly invest in blockchain strategies. According to <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-2023-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report.html\">PwC’s 2023 Global Crypto Hedge Fund Report</a>, traditional hedge funds remained confident about crypto’s long-term value proposition despite market volatility.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.ocorian.com/press-releases/family-offices-turn-crypto-client-demand-grows\">2023 research</a> revealed that 90% of family offices include crypto and digital assets in their investment strategies. In the APAC region, crypto has become a significant new asset class. In fact, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/among-affluent-asian-investors-52-hold-crypto-survey-finds\">52% of affluent Asian investors hold crypto</a>. Furthermore, several financial institutions in Hong Kong, including <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/10/ubs-groups-wealthy-clients-can-now-trade-some-crypto-etfs-in-hong-kong-bloomberg/\">UBS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/hong-kongs-hsbc-allows-customers-to-trade-bitcoin-ether-etfs-but-thats-not-really-news/\">HSBC</a>, are reportedly allowing their wealthy customers to trade crypto ETFs. Hong Kong’s Securities and Exchange Commission is also exploring <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/261600/hong-kong-considers-allowing-retail-access-to-spot-crypto-etfs-report\">allowing retail investors to buy spot crypto ETFs</a>.</p>\n<h1>Technological Innovation and Government Support</h1>\n<p>In 2023, central banks and financial institutions in the region have taken a more progressive stance, exploring blockchain technology and recognizing the benefits of integrating this technology into the existing financial infrastructure. The <a href=\"https://www.ledgerinsights.com/global-layer-1-gl1-blockchain-tokenization-bny-dbs-jpm-mufg/\">Monetary Authority of Singapore launched Project Guardian</a> partnered with 17 key financial institutions. The project successfully piloted cross-border currency settlement on public blockchain, tokenized deposit and off-chain asset tokenization. Similarly, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has launched the <a href=\"https://www.financeasia.com/article/hkma-publishes-findings-of-e-hkd-pilot/492448\">eHKD pilot</a>. Findings from both programs have highlighted the benefits of blockchain technology and have paved the way for further adoptions.</p>\n<h1>Encouraging Regulatory Policies</h1>\n<p>The increasing popularity of digital assets in APAC has also been bolstered by the growing regulatory certainty in the region.</p>\n<p>In Hong Kong, the government <a href=\"https://www.kwm.com/global/en/insights/latest-thinking/hong-kongs-new-virtual-asset-regime-what-you-need-to-know.html\">enforced a Centralized Exchange (CEX) license framework</a> to facilitate greater market participation. Banks operating in the city, such as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/hsbc-standard-chartered-face-pressure-hong-kong-take-crypto-clients-ft-2023-06-15/\">HSBC and Standard Chartered</a>, have been encouraged by the government to cater to the needs of licensed crypto exchanges. The city is also looking to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/hong-kong-eyes-stablecoin-regulatory-regime-by-2024/\">introduce a regulatory framework</a> around stablecoins by the end of 2024. Similarly, countries like Singapore and Japan are moving towards defining a more concrete crypto framework.</p>\n<p>With regulatory green lights and growing demand, the last piece of the puzzle for mainstream institutional adoption is enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure, and MetaMask Institutional is key to this infrastructure.</p>\n<h1>The Role of MetaMask Institutional</h1>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI) bridges the gap between traditional financial structures and blockchain technology. The current blockchain infrastructure for enterprises can be fragmented and complex, often requiring multiple tools for custody, reporting, and risk management which results in inefficiencies in operation and high costs.</p>\n<p>MMI offers a complete ecosystem that consolidates all essential enterprise services in an easily manageable package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Seamless Custody-DeFi experience:</strong> MMI maintains parity with the retail MetaMask and is natively integrated with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/custody/\">more than a dozen</a> best-in-class licensed custodians, custody technology providers and smart contract wallets.

free-market gaming platform. Our focus was to offer greater flexibility and ownership than the web2 paradigm, and also provide a more accessible cross-platform experience.

This overlay is powered by <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, making it secure and easy for gamers to access all of these functions no matter what game they're playing. Wallet transactions take place without leaving a game — reducing friction, improving safety, and preserving immersive experiences.</p>\n<p>Players can use the same trusted wallet across multiple games and marketplaces instead of traipsing from one platform to the next with a handful of proprietary wallets. Gamers can play their entire existing games library in the HyperPlay app including from other stores like Epic Games and GOG, and combine this library with the games from HyperPlay’s own official store, all gathered in a single gaming hub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/55zJTyGyThEpypbYEsshCu/1013a41b0c9fd815b795a5600871e9b6/image4.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay store\"></p>\n<h2>Our new user experience</h2>\n<p>By eliminating the need to leave the game to manage assets, HyperPlay’s MetaMask overlay experience enhances gaming immersion — assets can be managed without skipping a beat. Reducing friction in web3 gaming is crucial for encouraging adoption — and bringing tokens and in-game collectibles closer to the action increases their utility. Assets that players own should be a joy to use rather than a burden. Streamlining and strengthening the transaction process doesn't just help players, it unlocks new opportunities for developers to innovate and better serve their audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> offers a secure, simple way to explore the web3 gaming universe, featuring HyperPlay's curated list of MetaMask-compatible games, which make it even easier to onboard new players to web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5V4Q9S09rmMCkaQFaC2mnL/f563b4786503fe534e012074149c26a0/image2.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Portfolio HyperPlay integration\"></p>\n<h2>Securely powering gamers into the future</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay’s MetaMask integration also results in another essential benefit: a safer onboarding experience. The HyperPlay app allows for MetaMask transactions to be visible on-screen without the need to leave or even minimize the gaming experience, all while preserving the privacy of user keys. Secret recovery phrases are never exposed to games, and can even be kept off the gaming computer itself.</p>\n<p>For an extra layer of protection, HyperPlay and MetaMask offer users an external signing feature powered by MetaMask Mobile, which keeps keys off the player’s device. With MetaMask Mobile, gamers can send transactions to an external mobile device, providing a secure connection method that acts as an additional barrier against any potential security compromise.</p>\n<p>Combining the innovative tech of HyperPlay’s game store with the ironclad safety of MetaMask Portfolio’s in-game overlay is a powerful combination. Gone are the days where gamers have to hop out of game screens at a critical moment to swap tokens, bridge networks or buy crypto with fiat.
