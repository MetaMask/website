However, as my previous update denoted, my aim is to pause and provide a reflection on a quarterly basis, noting the features released and product milestones achieved within MetaMask Institutional (MMI).</p>\n<p>Since the ICO days of 2017, there has often been a continued narrative of institutions investing in what is now called Web3. Yet, institutional capital was relatively elusive for the first few years. The DeFi summer proved that this time was different, and what we have seen over the last two years is an avalanche of VC, Crypto Fund and Hedge Fund capital flooding into Web3 and DeFi. Also, we have started to see more and more traditional organisations allocating to NFTs. As the great Marc Andreessen noted, software is eating the world. Perhaps, we would add a modifier: Web3 is eating the world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” – Charles Dickens</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This first quarter of this year marked another profound period—Sadly, mired in international conflict. Geopolitical uncertainty, threats of high inflation, and stagnant economic growth impacted digital assets over January and February. Yet, despite these extreme conditions, we continue to see robust institutional flows into our ecosystem. New <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/pantera-capitals-blockchain-fund-has-1b-in-commitments/\">funds are being raised</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/galaxy-digital-facilitates-goldman-sachs-s-first-otc-crypto-options-trade-830533375.html\">traditional finance is starting to invest more</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/09/24/british-museum-to-sell-nfts-of-200-hokusai-worksincluding-the-great-wave\">organisations of all stripes</a> are taking steps into Web3. From MMI’s purview, we experienced record growth across all regions in Q1 along with record assets invested into DeFi by TVL.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed” – William Gibson</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Web3 is a paradigm shift. A better way to organise society. DeFi, for example, offers capital markets that are interoperable and transparent with near-zero costs and instant settlement. NFTs are a profound way to create and store value. Underlying these products are smart contracts and ERC standards and the first principled value and philosophy of decentralisation. An idea whose time has come. Given this wave of innovation, our goal within MetaMask Institutional is to bridge every organisation on planet earth into Web3.</p>\n<p>To create a mental model, we see Web3 as the Southbank of London or the island of Manhattan—With most institutions living in Web2 on the Northbank, or other islands metaphorically speaking. In order to ferry institutional traffic from Web2 to Web3, we build more bridges (i.e. integrations with world-class custodians) to connect these two worlds. We fortify our bridges with features to serve the needs of institutional traffic (i.e. our Portfolio Dashboard, KYT risk management, and detailed reporting). We are also seeing an explosion of new organisations (DAOs) born in Web3, with similar institutional needs—And we also look to offer our bridges to these entities to connect them to the ever-increasing opportunities that DeFi provides.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“We need a product that our customers love” – Marty Cagan</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the quarter we delivered on <strong>three key initiatives</strong>; All with the aim to increase the number of bridges and fortify them with institutional features.</p>\n<h2>Unrivaled EVM access and bridging for custodial accounts</h2>\n<p>MMI—like the original non-custodial MetaMask wallet—offers its users access to DeFi and Web3 across all EMV-compatible chains. MMI differs from the original MetaMask in that it is a custodial wallet. This means that custodians and custody technology providers facilitate key storage, key management, transaction signatures, and transaction broadcasting for MMI users, in line with institutional regulations.</p>\n<p>Given that it is the custodians who broadcast the transactions—the actual EVM chain access of MMI users is determined by the chains supported by their custodian. In practice for example, if a custodian only supports transactions on the Ethereum mainnet and Polygon network, then an MMI user would be limited to transacting across these two chains. Accordingly, we rolled out our multi-chain feature that will support our custodian partners in rolling out more EVM chain access. This will give custodians the capabilities to add, sign, and broadcast any custom RPC URL specified by the user—making the rollout of new EVM chain support much easier.</p>\n<p>The ability to bridge assets is a fundamental institutional need within DeFi. This entails performing a cross-chain swap by depositing an asset into a bridge contract in one chain and then receiving minted assets on another chain. Bridging allows the ability to move assets to APY and unlocks yield farming opportunities across EVM chains.</p>\n<p>Based on the way many custodians are architected meant that MMI, historically, has connected one account to one network. This means that institutions would set up an account at a custodian and then have that account tied to a particular network, for example, Mainnet or Polygon. This one to one relationship, although providing access, prevents the bridging of assets. For assets to be bridged, the address used to deposit tokens into the bridge contract must be the same to receive the minted tokens.</p>\n<p>With our multichain feature, we removed the connection between accounts and networks historically held by custodial accounts. This means that similar to MetaMask, custodial accounts on MMI will be available across multiple networks. As our custodian partners roll out more EVM-chain support, users will automatically have access to accounts on these chains, with no additional work required from either party—allowing for the bridging of assets across chains.</p>\n<h2>Standardized custodian integration architecture</h2>\n<p>To address the different custody needs of all organisations seeking to enter the DeFi and Web3 space, MetaMask Institutional practises custodian-agnosticism. This means we work with multiple custodians that offer different custody technology stacks. It is our goal to ensure that the integration of any custodian is fast, seamless, and requires the lowest development effort possible.</p>\n<p>At the start of January, we launched our V2 JSON-RPC API Integration Architecture.</p>\n<p>This latest version allows us to compress integration steps and dramatically simplify the onboarding of new custodians by standardising our integration stack. We have also aligned the API custodians need to build with the JSON-RPC API, an open-source standard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aw5ILK0gAyyYvfJGT2CCd/89feb34616214bea720fffa375f11980/MMI-Custodian-Integration.png\" alt=\"MMI-Custodian-Integration\"></p>\n<p>While integration still requires minimal bespoke work from the MMI team, new custodians can now integrate with a standard API and client. This movement towards a “self-service” model has allowed for multiple custodians to integrate simultaneously during the last quarter.</p>\n<p>In addition, aligning our custodian API with an open-source JSON-RPC standard transforms our stack into a platform that developers can build and innovate on top of. It also aligns MMI’s architecture closely with that of MetaMask and Infura. With the JSON-RPC API, custodians could eventually write <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html\">snaps</a> for MMI and MetaMask while Infura developers can build and launch custodians and custodian services.</p>\n<h2>The Portfolio Dashboard</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jrzlIZMWVaKIv9v1kM1Gg/821bee072e9702429424c709ea878718/MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch.png\" alt=\"MMI-DeFi-and-Web3-Dashboard-Launch\"></p>\n<p>At the start of the quarter, we launched the <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/metamask-institutional/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-and-web3-focused-dashboard-for-organizations/\">MMI Portfolio Dashboard</a>. A new canvas upon which we can build tailored institutional user experiences. We see this dashboard as another bridge and, eventually, an execution layer to Web3. The Portfolio Dashboard is a special privileged dapp. It recognises MMI wallets and then brings in all your accounts (Default, Hardware Wallet and Custodial) to provide a consolidated view of all your holdings across all EVMs. As Reid Hoffman noted, if you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. Standing on principles, our initial launch showed token holdings and historical balances across Mainnet, Polygon and BSC. A minimal viable product if you will.</p>\n<p>Over the quarter we rolled out a series of dramatic improvements to the Portfolio Dashboard. Today, we show pool balances and DeFi holdings across all EVMs with token, lending and borrowing LP, farming, leveraged farming, rewards tokens, governance, staked and yield and other positions. We also provide detailed lending and borrowing positions including APYs, APRs, health factors and interest earned and owned. Lastly, we rolled out CSV downloading of transaction history. We ended the quarter with a minimum lovable product. One that only contains a true consolidated view but offers great UX and design with minimal latency.</p>\n<p>Next, we will be rolling out detailed NFT views and LP positions, along with updating our CSV download with more granularity. We also have many features planned over the Q2 and Q3 as we build our Portfolio Dashboard into a product users can’t live without.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.” – Albert Einstein</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted previously, we follow strict product and design principles within MMI, identifying what we define as tier-1 user needs. Painkillers over vitamins if you will. One of our product principles is to get outside of the building (thus many of you have been on calls with us). We thank you for your dedicated time. We follow the principles of continuous discovery and pay close attention to your voice. Our goal is to be of service and value to you and to build products and experiences that you can’t live without. This coming quarter you will see a series of features in service of your voice. Along with a few important public announcements. As we further entrench our mission of being a bridge for all organisations, while further adhering to our decentralisation values.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,\n<strong>Johann Bornman</strong></p>\n<p>Global

crypto ecosystem. Early attacks included Secret Recovery Phrase theft, and Malware to steal user credentials. Attacks have since evolved to include complex wallet drainers that steal funds through malicious transactions.</p>\n<p>Attacks take advantage of web3 users via many types of tactics, including <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/staying-safe-in-web3/crypto-job-scams\">crypto job scams</a>. As the crypto space grows, so do employment opportunities, and with them scam targets. Scams in web3 have resulted in high financial losses for users. According to Chainanalysis,  <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">$24.2 billion dollars</a> were received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses in 2023. These losses illustrate why it is crucial to protect users, brands, and communities in crypto.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask security team recognizes the need for a fast response system to blocklist malicious sites. So, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect\">Eth-Phishing-Detect</a> – a public GitHub repository that maintains a blocklist with over 205,000 malicious domains. This blocklist shows a warning from Metamask the moment a user visits a new site, preventing attacks like seed phrase theft, malware downloads, fake support pages, and connecting to wallet-draining sites.</p>\n<p>Dedicated MetaMask staff review contributions from ChainPatrol, the Security Alliance (SEAL), and over 100 community members providing threat intelligence. Eth-Phishing-Detect enables transparency, and fast responses to the growing volume of phishing attacks and scams. With MetaMask’s recent upgrades to blocklist distribution speed, malicious sites show a warning within minutes of detection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3aRCLJiskw20j3WmkHRkHr/4bc111b412a4f81024d550a7fe919168/MetaMask_Eth_Phishing_Detect_warning.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Phishing Detect warning\"></p>\n<h2>ChainPatrol, a core contributor to Eth-Phishing-Detect</h2>\n<p>Each week, tens of thousands of new threats targeting Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea are blocked. As MetaMask’s phishing detection provider, <a href=\"https://chainpatrol.io/\">ChainPatrol</a> recognized the power of a blocklist approach early on.</p>\n<p>While traditional takedowns are still important, in the worst cases it can take over a day to remove a phishing site entirely. MetaMask warnings protect users in real-time, before takedowns are processed. Phishing sites are taken down within 15 minutes of being added to the blocklist, after which time users receive a warning.</p>\n<p>ChainPatrol’s goal is to identify all impersonators of Consensys and MetaMask before they reach users. ChainPatrol assesses millions of domains daily to identify phishing sites, such as fake MetaMask download links, and fake support portals. Image Recognition, LLM analysis, and malicious code detection are used to identify harmful domains.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social platforms are also monitored, both for brand impersonation and fake staff accounts. Every time one of the official accounts post, ChainPatrol monitors the replies in real-time, immediately blocking phishing links and fake support accounts. Additionally, App Stores are monitored to ensure users are not led into downloading a fake version of the MetaMask extension.</p>\n<p>Users in Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities are being protected from the thousands of threats that target them on a weekly basis. By addressing these threats with speed, users are protected from having their data and wallets compromised.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/52fcYS0XoMmzrMcPClmA2n/5d826b2547e5e1822f9965016b822080/MetaMask_Threats_Blocked_By_Day_.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Threats Blocked By Day\"></p>\n<p><em>In 2024, ChainPatrol blocked over 29,000 threats targeting Consensys brands including Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea.

MetaMask has dedicated staff monitoring the issues of Eth-Phishing-Detect to ensure any disputes for false positives are resolved quickly.</p>\n<p>To enhance visibility, ChainPatrol maintains a <a href=\"https://app.chainpatrol.io/search?content=metamasksupport-u839s.grsrc.com\">public search page</a>. This search page gives visibility into the blocklist statuses across a number of crypto security systems, provides access to detailed reports, and reasons for blocking a given domain. Any blocked domain can be quickly disputed from the ChainPatrol search page. This dispute system instantly alerts the ChainPatrol team, ensuring any disputes are addressed within minutes.</p>\n<p>The public search page also serves as a resource for users in the Consensys, MetaMask, and Linea communities. Users have the option to run a suspicious domain through the public search tool to see if it’s been flagged on the blocklist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/67DzjgcHkOfyodhLI2wBVE/fd570f83a6a2d38f079eaeba4f3c080a/MetaMask_Chainpatrol_Phishing_blocked.png\" alt=\"MetaMask Chainpatrol Phishing blocked\"></p>\n<h2>Keeping users safe with MetaMask and ChainPatrol</h2>\n<p>Crypto never sleeps, and security systems must act quickly based on real-time threat intelligence.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<h2>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<h2>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<h2>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Key Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<h2>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</h2>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in web3, via customizable settings, secure transactions, and user consent features to protect digital identity.
