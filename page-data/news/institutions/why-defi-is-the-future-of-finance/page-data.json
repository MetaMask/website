While we’re not quite there yet, there is a good reason why DeFi has captured the popular imagination: the total value locked in DeFi protocols has surpassed $100B.</p>\n<p>That’s not all. Ethereum, which accounts for over 68% of collateral in DeFi, settled $6 trillion worth of transactions in the twelve months to October 2021.</p>\n<p>The market value of Ethereum-based DeFi transactions is proof enough that it is giving TradFi a run for its money. In addition, DeFi may soon be the preferred choice for institutions to fulfill their credit needs due to its ability to provide financing at more competitive rates when compared with TradFi.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at how DeFi makes cheaper financing possible.</p>\n<p>Financial incumbents in the TradFi space have a high cost of servicing clients, right from onboarding, and trade execution, to post-trade activities such as clearing and settlement. TradFi institutions spend about $20B in trade processing annually, according to an estimate by The Bank of England. TradFi can save up to 80% of post-trade settlement expenses by leveraging distributed-ledger technology (DLT).</p>\n<p>The high cost of servicing clients and legacy infrastructure means that TradFi has limited financial innovation ability. Many banks and central securities depositories are piloting tokenization projects that look to improve existing asset classes. These projects, while showing evidence of technical feasibility, fail to go live.</p>\n<p>The business case for these projects is a tough one to make when accounting for the cost of migrating to a new system.To add to this, there is the challenge of adjusting existing processes, and stakeholder and user behaviour, in line with any new technology. We saw similar behaviour when sales and trading desks moved from voice to digital. New business divisions with differently skilled personnel grew the digital business, while the personnel and systems dedicated to voice declined.</p>\n<p>DeFi is well placed to disrupt TradFi with new, and innovative financing options as it does not use any of the TradFi structures to build its alternative financing structures. “It took Tesla to reimagine a better user experience. Ford or Toyota could not have done this without disrupting existing sales models,” says Elizabeth Matthew, Executive Director at Consensys.</p>\n<p>The lack of existing market infrastructure solutions within DeFi provide a fertile ground to rethink the user experience in the capital markets lifecycle. This helps create new financial primitives, alternate financing structures and yield generating opportunities. DeFi now consists of over 17,000 protocols such as Aave, Compound and Uniswap for lending, borrowing, staking, hedging, swapping and yield farming.</p>\n<p>DeFi has also dramatically shrunk the cost of manufacturing and distributing various assets, similar to what the internet did for publishing and advertising. One reason for these lower costs is DeFi’s peer-to-peer lending mechanism that strips out the third-party intermediary. This means that an institution looking to access credit can do so without having to pay a fee to a bank or another financial institution to grant that access.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Institutional (MMI), the institution-compliant version of the most used and trusted DeFi wallet MetaMask, provides access to DeFi’s unbound innovation with the widest access across EVM-compatible protocols. This is because almost all dapps are built to integrate with MetaMask. Through MMI, organizations can implement investment strategies for trading, lending, yield farming, and more.</p>\n<p>Only MMI provides unrivaled access to DeFi without compromising on institution-required security, operational efficiency, or compliance requirements.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">Explore MetaMask Institutional</a></strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"75mzA7RLLPzWfBjl54wLRJ","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Institutions","slug":"institutions"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},"news_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"news_dark_bg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"hubspot":{"contentful_id":"5VZVKtbcRMzaaP77nsz3Fs","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulHubSpotForm"},"title":"Receive our Newsletter","description":null,"portalId":"4795067","formId":"fbfea1e4-e214-4ab2-a98b-964f9a81695a","campaignId":null,"displayTitle":true,"width":null,"customClass":"newsletterOnNewsDetail","customId":null},"latest":{"internal":{"type":"ContentfulLayoutModuleContainer"},"contentful_id":"nO1tqQRjoUDUJfdg2B651","node_locale":"en-US","eyebrow":null,"headline":"Keep reading our latest stories","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Developers, security news, and more</p>"}},"modules":[{"node_locale":"en-US","contentful_id":"6iOGB8Fiab9ilS0jfZ8N5I","fontSize":null,"ctaLink":"/news/","displayText":"All posts","displayTextTreatment":null,"newTab":false,"buttonDisplay":false,"buttonGradient":false,"buttonSecondary":false,"hideButtonIcon":null,"eventLabel":null,"eventCategory":null,"socialLink":null,"showCaretRight":null,"buttonCaretDown":null,"launchDarklyFlag":null,"customClassName":null,"internal":{"type":"ContentfulCta"},"hubSpotForm":null,"embedHTML":null,"downloadBrowsers":null,"mobileCta":null,"alternativeCta":null},{"contentful_id":"1B0wZMveBTSiMJZWu4uunI","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulModuleContainer"},"title":"News > Latest Stories (3 items)","description":null,"numberOfItem":3,"columns":3,"columnType":null,"columnsOnTablet":null,"centerOnTablet":null,"columnsOnMobile":1,"centerOnMobile":null,"contentAlignment":"left","splitModules":false,"displayTitle":false,"isLiquiditySection":false,"isTrustBar":null,"gridModulesGap":"12px","loadMoreMode":null,"loadMoreCta":null,"carouselMode":null,"hasRegionSelector":null,"regionSelectorHeadline":null,"regionSelectorPopupTitle":null,"regionSelectorPopupText":null,"regionListKey":null,"extraData":null,"modules":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}]}],"cta":null,"backgroundColor":"default","displayHeadline":true,"headlineAlignCenter":true,"contentAlignCenter":false,"headlineMarginTop0":null,"paddingTop":"40px","sectionPadding":null,"noPaddingTop":null,"noPaddingBottom":false,"modulesMargin":null,"isTab":false,"moduleId":null,"customClass":"storiesOnNewsDetail","sideImage":null,"backgroundSize":"cover","backgroundImage":null},"latestStories":{"nodes":[{"contentful_id":"1ZwT5dKh4Z0FZuaBp7YSPK","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Transfers from Coinbase and Binance now available in MetaMask","slug":"metamask-centralized-exchange-transfers-coinbase-binance","subtitle":"MetaMask launches new CEX transfer feature to make your wallet more powerful.

No additional KYC necessary.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_wNpeCZubE?si=Ab5IgUTkcxL73JNY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>In April 2024, MetaMask partnered with <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-partners-with-meld-to-scale-crypto-adoption/?utm_source=owned-metamask&#x26;utm_medium=content&#x26;utm_campaign=cmp-7313062-afbf08\">Meld</a> and <a href=\"https://www.meshconnect.com/blog/mesh-and-metamask-revolutionizing-digital-asset-management-through-innovation\">Mesh</a> to launch a feature that allowed users to <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/track-your-crypto-exchange-and-wallet-balances/?utm_source=owned-metamask&#x26;utm_medium=content&#x26;utm_campaign=cmp-7323064-afbf08\">track external CEX balances</a> by linking Coinbase or Binance accounts directly from the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?utm_source=owned-metamask&#x26;utm_medium=content&#x26;utm_campaign=cmp-7333067-afbf08\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> dashboard.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?

By leveraging both MetaMask hot wallet and NGRAVE ZERO hardware wallet, users can benefit from convenience and accessibility, while maintaining the highest levels of security.</p>\n<h2>Increased security</h2>\n<p>Because hardware wallets are offline, they significantly reduce the risk of being hacked, and unauthorized access to users’ private keys. Hardware wallets, sometimes called “cold wallets” also serve as a secure backup for private keys, ensuring that primary assets remain safe even if the hot wallet is compromised. Since users retain total control over their private keys, the integration expands self-custody management of their crypto assets. Additionally, as hardware wallets are online by default, MetaMask stays up-to-date with alerts, to minimize the risk of phishing attacks and malware that typically target hot wallets.</p>\n<h2>Convenience and accessibility</h2>\n<p>Users can quickly access and manage their funds through their MetaMask hot wallet, allowing them to buy, sell, transfer, bridge, stake, and more – while signing fully offline via their hardware wallet. This avoids compromising the security of larger holdings stored in the hardware wallet. MetaMask wallet allows for seamless transactions, without moving assets between different wallets frequently. A streamlined integration between hot and cold wallets provides a smoother user experience, making it easier for novice and experienced users to manage their assets versatile and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: for the MetaMask browser extension, the minimum required version to use the NGRAVE integration is v. 12.3.0.
