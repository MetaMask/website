Please ensure that you have all other extensions (including MetaMask), uninstalled in your browser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4EeQyAfTbSqWQ8pLJ67HBW/7fdc66dd73d740d17b3ab64e9e99e09b/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-4.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-4\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5SxcopprEyeMBHCZe3lXsl/e8d6b7f73775883a6ffe2c96bec2c163/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-5.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-5\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/cB997zET2GOobas07ETII/8def9b187e88b20b90ce2f60cf3e488c/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-6.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-6\"></p>\n<h2>Step 5: Connect custodial accounts</h2>\n<p>Next, we guide you to our relevant custody and custody-tech partners to link your custodian accounts to the MMI Extension. As MMI has the same codebase as MetaMask, you can use the MMI Extension with a Hardware wallet or Seed Recovery Phrase Accounts (SRPs), namely the default accounts controlled by the private keys in the extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6PjdT62oirSHMoVSxj3HwC/f85a435b433f504fee67fc2678085396/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-7.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-7\"></p>\n<p>If you select custodial accounts, we will direct you to our list of partners and guide you to their platforms to import your custodial accounts into the MMI extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4HNoTdiah8A8RMGMvjlrKJ/c58f0a51787be21b5df1a731959d6ef9/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-8.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-8\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3zxiE9KOiEykDLlyvIzJE/a33ab01ecf7f05d61f32106e22f7c44f/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-9.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-9\"></p>\n<h2>Step 6: Invite team members</h2>\n<p>Following this step, an administrator can then invite team members to their organization.

Who can sign up for MMI?</strong></p>\n<p>To sign up, we require an administrator user to go through our onboarding process. An administrator can then invite other users to the organization. If you are an existing user of MMI, you will have a Primary Point of Contact for your organization. We require the primary point of contact to onboard with us. If you are not an existing user of MMI, please contact our sales team: <a href=\"mailto:MMI_Sales@consensys.net\">MMI_Sales@consensys.net</a></p>\n<p><strong>2. What information do I need to provide?</strong></p>\n<p>You create your organization by adding a name and physical address.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How much does MMI cost?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Institutional has a seat-based subscription model. Our seat-based pricing is divided across three tiers, with a maximum number of seats in each tier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7MI1kYxtIY2WLEtRZ6omc1/436b6c8b4b30657cafe8a316580cf218/MMI-Login_FAQs-1.png\" alt=\"MMI-Login FAQs-1\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. How will you take payment?</strong></p>\n<p>We support invoice payment in ETH, USDC and USD.</p>\n<p><strong>5. When will I be invoiced?</strong></p>\n<p>Invoices will appear in the Portfolio Dashboard within 10 business days of the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong>6. When are invoices payable?</strong></p>\n<p>Invoices need to be paid within 30 days of invoicing.</p>\n<p><strong>7. How can I cancel my subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions are canceled by giving 30 day’s written notice.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How many different roles are available, and what can they do?</strong></p>\n<p>We have two roles within the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, Admin and Regular user roles. Admin users manage payments and can invite and delete users. Regular users will be invited to the dashboard. Admin users can create settings that apply at an organization-level. For example, how accounts are grouped at an organization level.</p>\n<p><strong>9. How many members can I add to the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>We have no limit to the number of members you can add to an organization.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Will the role settings impact performing any activities natively on the MMI platform? E.g. swapping, staking, or exporting historic transactions</strong></p>\n<p>The role settings currently do not impact access levels or activities within MMI. We will roll out more roles and permissions over time.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many admin roles can one account have? What if I’d like to have multiple admins as there are a few key decision makers within the organization. How will this work? And will they have rights to override each other?</strong></p>\n<p>You can have multiple admins in an organization. All admins will have the same access and abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>12. Will the role setting in MMI impact my current governance settings with my custodian partner(s)?</strong></p>\n<p>Our current role settings do not impact any policy or governance settings at your custodian.</p>\n<p><strong>13. How do I add accounts to my organization within the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are three ways to add accounts into the portfolio dashboard. Firstly when you transact with custodial accounts, we automatically detect and add these accounts to your organization. When you add new accounts into the Extension that you have not yet transacted with nor are part of your organization, we provide a helpful notice that we have detected new accounts not yet part of your organization and ask if you want to add them to your organization. Lastly, you can navigate to the Portfolio Dashboard’s accounts section and add any accounts you would like to your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>14. How many bundles can I create within the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no limits to the number of bundles you can create.</p>\n<p><strong>15. I don't use the Portfolio Dashboard much/at all, will it impact trade execution using the MMI browser extension?</strong></p>\n<p>You will still be able to use the MMI browser extension unencumbered. In order to onboard to MMI, invite Team members and give them access to the MMI Extension, organizations have to onboard the Portfolio Dashboard.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. For Yooldo – a gaming community focused on security and autonomy – MetaMask is essential.</p>\n<h2>A new era of web3 gaming</h2>\n<p>In traditional online gaming, players' assets are controlled by the developer or publisher, and stored on centralized servers. This setup leaves users at risk of losing access to their digital items, which can happen for various reasons including a company modifying its policies, or shutting down the game. In web3 gaming, players have full ownership of their digital assets, independent of the game itself. This decentralization ensures that Yooldo gamers have complete control over their assets, with no monolithic authority able to restrict access or manipulate users’ holdings.</p>\n<h2>How MetaMask keeps gaming assets safe</h2>\n<p>With self-custody comes gamers' responsibility for maintaining safety of their own assets. The decentralized security that <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask</a> offers is vital for Yooldo gamers. Users have control over their private keys, which means that even in the case of a data breach, gaming assets will remain secure. All actions on Yooldo are also transparent and traceable – whether purchasing an in-game asset, or interacting with the platform. And, each transaction requires user approval, via blockchain’s cryptographic validation and consensus protocols.</p>\n<p>Another critical feature that safeguards users is phishing protection, powered by MetaMask and ChainPatrol’s <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-chainpatrol-protect-users-with-phishing-warnings/\">Eth-Phishing-Protect</a>. MetaMask provides in-app warnings, and domain verification systems to protect users from dubious links and attacks. This allows Yooldo gamers  to be alerted to potentially malicious websites quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Empowering gamers through decentralization</h2>\n<p>As the web3 ecosystem grows, security is of the utmost importance. Gamers can store, buy, sell, and trade their in-game assets directly, without worrying about data breaches, server failures, or third-party interference. More broadly, MetaMask enables players to transfer assets between different games, or wider marketplaces. Digital gaming assets earned in Yooldo can be sold or traded for tokens with real-world value, extending their utility beyond gameplay. No matter where you are in your web3 gaming journey, MetaMask continues to offer more ways to stay secure.</p>\n<p><strong>Ready to dive into web3 gaming?
