Please ensure that you have all other extensions (including MetaMask), uninstalled in your browser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4EeQyAfTbSqWQ8pLJ67HBW/7fdc66dd73d740d17b3ab64e9e99e09b/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-4.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-4\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5SxcopprEyeMBHCZe3lXsl/e8d6b7f73775883a6ffe2c96bec2c163/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-5.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-5\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/cB997zET2GOobas07ETII/8def9b187e88b20b90ce2f60cf3e488c/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-6.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-6\"></p>\n<h2>Step 5: Connect custodial accounts</h2>\n<p>Next, we guide you to our relevant custody and custody-tech partners to link your custodian accounts to the MMI Extension. As MMI has the same codebase as MetaMask, you can use the MMI Extension with a Hardware wallet or Seed Recovery Phrase Accounts (SRPs), namely the default accounts controlled by the private keys in the extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6PjdT62oirSHMoVSxj3HwC/f85a435b433f504fee67fc2678085396/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-7.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-7\"></p>\n<p>If you select custodial accounts, we will direct you to our list of partners and guide you to their platforms to import your custodial accounts into the MMI extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4HNoTdiah8A8RMGMvjlrKJ/c58f0a51787be21b5df1a731959d6ef9/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-8.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-8\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3zxiE9KOiEykDLlyvIzJE/a33ab01ecf7f05d61f32106e22f7c44f/MMI-SBP_Onboarding-9.png\" alt=\"MMI-SBP Onboarding-9\"></p>\n<h2>Step 6: Invite team members</h2>\n<p>Following this step, an administrator can then invite team members to their organization.

Who can sign up for MMI?</strong></p>\n<p>To sign up, we require an administrator user to go through our onboarding process. An administrator can then invite other users to the organization. If you are an existing user of MMI, you will have a Primary Point of Contact for your organization. We require the primary point of contact to onboard with us. If you are not an existing user of MMI, please contact our sales team: <a href=\"mailto:MMI_Sales@consensys.net\">MMI_Sales@consensys.net</a></p>\n<p><strong>2. What information do I need to provide?</strong></p>\n<p>You create your organization by adding a name and physical address.</p>\n<p><strong>3. How much does MMI cost?</strong></p>\n<p>Metamask Institutional has a seat-based subscription model. Our seat-based pricing is divided across three tiers, with a maximum number of seats in each tier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7MI1kYxtIY2WLEtRZ6omc1/436b6c8b4b30657cafe8a316580cf218/MMI-Login_FAQs-1.png\" alt=\"MMI-Login FAQs-1\"></p>\n<p><strong>4. How will you take payment?</strong></p>\n<p>We support invoice payment in ETH, USDC and USD.</p>\n<p><strong>5. When will I be invoiced?</strong></p>\n<p>Invoices will appear in the Portfolio Dashboard within 10 business days of the end of the month.</p>\n<p><strong>6. When are invoices payable?</strong></p>\n<p>Invoices need to be paid within 30 days of invoicing.</p>\n<p><strong>7. How can I cancel my subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>Subscriptions are canceled by giving 30 day’s written notice.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How many different roles are available, and what can they do?</strong></p>\n<p>We have two roles within the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, Admin and Regular user roles. Admin users manage payments and can invite and delete users. Regular users will be invited to the dashboard. Admin users can create settings that apply at an organization-level. For example, how accounts are grouped at an organization level.</p>\n<p><strong>9. How many members can I add to the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>We have no limit to the number of members you can add to an organization.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Will the role settings impact performing any activities natively on the MMI platform? E.g. swapping, staking, or exporting historic transactions</strong></p>\n<p>The role settings currently do not impact access levels or activities within MMI. We will roll out more roles and permissions over time.</p>\n<p><strong>11. How many admin roles can one account have? What if I’d like to have multiple admins as there are a few key decision makers within the organization. How will this work? And will they have rights to override each other?</strong></p>\n<p>You can have multiple admins in an organization. All admins will have the same access and abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>12. Will the role setting in MMI impact my current governance settings with my custodian partner(s)?</strong></p>\n<p>Our current role settings do not impact any policy or governance settings at your custodian.</p>\n<p><strong>13. How do I add accounts to my organization within the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are three ways to add accounts into the portfolio dashboard. Firstly when you transact with custodial accounts, we automatically detect and add these accounts to your organization. When you add new accounts into the Extension that you have not yet transacted with nor are part of your organization, we provide a helpful notice that we have detected new accounts not yet part of your organization and ask if you want to add them to your organization. Lastly, you can navigate to the Portfolio Dashboard’s accounts section and add any accounts you would like to your organization.</p>\n<p><strong>14. How many bundles can I create within the Portfolio Dashboard?</strong></p>\n<p>There are no limits to the number of bundles you can create.</p>\n<p><strong>15. I don't use the Portfolio Dashboard much/at all, will it impact trade execution using the MMI browser extension?</strong></p>\n<p>You will still be able to use the MMI browser extension unencumbered. In order to onboard to MMI, invite Team members and give them access to the MMI Extension, organizations have to onboard the Portfolio Dashboard.

The collection of data traces back millennia to the first writing instruments. Record keeping tools were primitive—a stone, bone, or reed, and functional—tabulating supplies, crops, or transactions. In the centuries since, data collection has undergone exponential evolution from crude manual methods to innovative digital techniques, particularly over the last 40 years. The advent of the internet has allowed for information to be instantaneously transmitted globally. Today, our data is owned and exploited by siloed, monolithic organizations to exert control.</p>\n<p>Web1: “The Static Iteration” or Read Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>The internet didn’t start out this way. Web1 existed from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. Built with open-source code and a permissionless network, it enabled users to access stored information on static websites and read the content. Data collection was limited. Sensitive personal information largely remained offline. Interconnectivity was prized.</p>\n<p>Web2: “The Social Web” or Read Write Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Web2 has existed from the early 2000s through the 2020s, enabling users to access and interact with websites, mobile apps, and social media networks. As they do, each individual paints a uniquely detailed, digital data portrait of themselves, while adding to User Generated Content (UGC) that informs larger demographic patterns. UGC from over 5 billion people online is held in centralized, closed-off systems, owned entirely by corporations.</p>\n<p>Rather than handling users' information privately or even with care, tech behemoths have done the polar opposite. Entities like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are driven by the mass-scale collection and surveillance of data. Highly nuanced personal information about each user is then monetized by advertisers, in order to target people with specific characteristics and behaviors. So, what is the alternative? Cover yourself in aluminum foil, decamp to a remote cave, and communicate solely via carrier pigeon? Not quite.</p>\n<p>Web3: “The Decentralized Web” or Read Write Own Era</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Web3 began to develop in the 2010s, and enables a much needed paradigm shift, one where data privacy and data ownership are paramount. By design, its technology processes information differently. Data is stored on a decentralized, distributed ledger via open-source, immutable, cryptographic code—reducing the risk of data abuse and attack. Within a ledger, data is compiled into blocks that are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. This is why the technology is called blockchain. No single entity can gain monopolistic control. Rather than relying on a centralized server or platform, it is a transparent, peer-to-peer network. This allows users to maintain ownership of their data, because there is no third-party owning user data for surveillance or monetization purposes.</p>\n<p>MetaMask: Championing Data Protection in Web3</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>To connect with blockchains, users must create a wallet address, consisting of an identifying alphanumeric string. This address is the only information needed to access permissionless, decentralized apps (dapps), allowing users to operate pseudo-anonymously if they wish to do so. With their wallet address, users can access and interact with the decentralized web. Being the gateway to web3 is a position of great responsibility. MetaMask, the world’s leading <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/metamask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet/\">self-custodial crypto wallet</a> operating on the Ethereum blockchain, is committed to data protection, user consent, and individual control. Let’s dive into how MetaMask achieves this in more detail.\nKey Features of MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>Whether you are a <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">crypto newbie</a> or a seasoned degen, MetaMask ensures you have full control over your self-custodial wallet. Our <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/privacy-and-security/privacy-best-practices/\">Privacy Best Practices</a> guide gives you an overview of important facets to keep in mind while navigating Web3. MetaMask supports users to make their own decisions regarding privacy as they see fit, via the integration of: customizable settings for privacy, and a tailored user experience; minimization of data sharing, with local device storage; encryption for secure transactions; transparency of processes and data collection methods.</p>\n<p>MetaMask’s Privacy Preserving Features can be adjusted as desired and include:</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Basic Settings</strong> such as gas estimates, token details, and malicious site warnings, can be tailored to user preferences</p>\n<p>●  <strong>RPC configuration</strong> can be changed from default to personal RPC endpoints</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMask Security Alerts</strong> simulating transactions and alerts users before interacting with potentially malicious dapps and smart contracts, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Phishing Detection</strong> alerting users if a site is identified as potentially malicious using a publicly curated list of sites, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Network Detail Checks</strong> performing a security check by comparing the name, symbol, RPC URL, and other network details with those on a publicly maintained list when a network is manually added, can be enabled or disabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>MetaMetrics analytics</strong> designed to help improve MetaMask's user experience with non-sensitive product data, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●  <strong>Customizable Smart Transactions</strong> improving and optimizing transactions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Auto-Detect Tokens</strong> utilizing a carefully curated list of data sources to identity tokens, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>NFT Media Display</strong> requiring retrieval of NFT file images form third-party services, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p>●   <strong>Proposed Nicknames</strong> elevating your wallet UX with human-readable moniker suggestions, can be disabled or enabled</p>\n<p><strong>Empowering MetaMask Users With More Privacy and Consent</strong></p>\n<p>MetaMask is committed to a consent-based approach to privacy. Our <a href=\"https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-privacy-notice-update\">privacy notice update</a> provides increased transparency on our data processing activities, and we:</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect your private keys.</p>\n<p>●  Do not sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect or retain personal information unless necessary to provide you with services and user experience.</p>\n<p>●  Do not collect financial payment or banking information. However, when you use on-ramp or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Web3 is transforming data privacy and data ownership. With MetaMask, you have authority over your digital identity, and the way your information is shared. Data is power, and MetaMask puts that power back into the hands of the people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> now to configure your privacy settings, and take control of your digital identity.</strong></em></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask’s Commitment to Data Privacy","metaDescription":"Discover how MetaMask champions data privacy in Web3, via customizable privacy settings, secure transactions, and consent features to protect digital identity.
