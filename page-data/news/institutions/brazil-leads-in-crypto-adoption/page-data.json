According to a survey on web3 perception conducted by <a href=\"https://consensys.io/insight-report/web3-and-crypto-global-survey-2023\">Consensys and YouGov</a>, 41% of Brazilians either own digital assets today or have owned those in the past. In fact, more Brazilians have purchased digital assets than traditional equities, according to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/21/why-brazil-is-the-big-latin-american-bet-for-global-crypto-exchanges/\">data from the Brazilian Central Bank</a>. This fact, uniquely - and importantly - displays a parity of sophistication and knowledge across genders.</p>\n<p>Brasilians, through self-custodial wallets, sophisticated exchanges, and even more traditional fintech and financial institutions, have been builders in every sense of web3 ethic - trading crypto assets, using stablecoins for savings and payments, contributing to vibrant NFT projects, participating in decentralized finance, pioneering decentralized science, creating projects for social inclusion - web3 in Brasil is not the future, it is the present.</p>\n<h1>New Rules, New World</h1>\n<p>Brazil is also a leader in cryptocurrency regulations. While many regulators, including those in the US, are skeptical towards crypto, Brazil’s people are actively embracing crypto use and enacting laws to enable a more responsible crypto ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In December 2023, Brazil passed the Legal Framework for Virtual Assets in Brasil (“Cryptoassets Act”). The law established the Brazilian central bank as the primary supervisor of the crypto economy in the country and is aimed at preventing crypto scams amidst the widespread adoption of web3. The Act also stipulates that some tokens projects that are deemed securities be regulated by the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários, the Brazilian securities regulator.</p>\n<p>The move aligns with the sentiments of Brazilians on regulation that were revealed in the Web3 Perception Survey. According to the survey, 48% Brazilians believed that cryptocurrencies should be heavily regulated, while 32% believed that regulators should create regulations to encourage responsible participation in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Further, the Cryptoassets Act went into effect in June 2023. One of the first actions the Brazilian Central Bank took was to grant Mercado Bitcoin, a Brazilian crypto exchange, the status of a payment institution. This now allows Mercado to participate directly in the payments system.  More recently Transfero has been granted payment institution status as well.</p>\n<p>The regulatory clarity has allowed consistent, responsible innovation from both traditional financial institutions like BTG (with their BTGDOL stablecoin and Mynt exchange), as well as from newer, more crypto native institutions like Transfero, FoxBit and Bitso. This, in turn, has made Brasil one of  the most sophisticated countries in the world for institutional web3 adoption.</p>\n<p>At MetaMask Institutional, we make web3 access easy for all institutions entering the space.</p>\n<h1>MetaMask Institutional: Unrivaled Access to DeFi</h1>\n<p>To make a simple financial transaction – making a payment, buying a stock, importing a good – requires interactions with various financial players in traditional finance. Take the SWIFT banking ecosystem for example. It is essentially a communications system used by a large network of TradFi institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions. A single transaction through SWIFT can include correspondent banks, corporates, custodians, investment managers, importers, exporters, exchanges and central banks that require a series of standards and a single messaging window.</p>\n<p>In the web3 ecosystem’s quest to transform the financial ecosystem, it also requires this same level of simple standard integration and a single window for institutions to be able to achieve seamless connectivity between different Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, DeFi protocols, custodians, risk providers, staking providers, etc.</p>\n<p>To this end MetaMask Institutional presents a standard single window unifying these experiences and providers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We maintain parity with MetaMask -

This can happen by tricking people into signing something that allows a nefarious actor to transfer a users’ assets.</p>\n<p>To address this critical safety issue, MetaMask has introduced Signature Insight Snaps, a new category of security tools built by third-party developers. These Snaps empower users with greater transparency and control over signature requests, helping to identify and avoid potential threats.</p>\n<p>Signature Insight Snaps integrate seamlessly with MetaMask. These tools work by analyzing the contents of requests, giving users insights into the signature’s purpose and potential risks. Leveraging knowledge from Signature Insight Snaps allows users to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of falling victim to phishing attempts, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The added layer of security reinforces users' trust, and also fosters a safer environment for web3 interactions.</p>\n<h2>Discover our first Signature Insights Snaps</h2>\n<p>Kleros Scout is the first Snap to support Signature Insights. It decodes the content of signature requests, and identifies the addresses of any contracts you may be authorizing in the signature via Kleros’s decentralized token curated registries. It can then warn you if the contract you are interacting with is malicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4m9NFwKPI72J5L1m9418nt/8399b863fb6d6c1d68760338b33db48e/image1.png\" alt=\"Kleros Scout insight in action.\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the Kleros Scout insight is displayed in the new signature request design. The insight shows that the contract being authorized by this signature request is the official Seaport 1.6 contract for NFT trading deployed by OpenSea.</em></p>\n<p>ZyFi Paymaster Insights is our second Signature Insight Snap to launch. It improves the readability of signing transactions in the zkSync ecosystem, especially for paymaster-related transactions using txType 113. ZyFi Paymaster Insights adds helpful information about the “from” and “to” addresses for these paymaster-related transactions. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them to avoid potentially malicious signatures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4rJ5Uj2w4IrZnBSnurXNze/79643d1a8f02649f72fa4bae72b08437/image2.png\" alt=\"ZyFi Paymaster Insights\"></p>\n<p><em>Above, the ZyFi Paymaster Insight shows the from address, to address, and the paymaster type of the signature request on zkSync.</em></p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/kleros/scout-snap/\">Kleros Scout Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/zyfi-paymaster-insight-snap/\">ZyFi Paymaster Insights</a> from the MetaMask Snaps Directory in MetaMask Extension 12.4.2 or later.</p>\n<h2>Build your own</h2>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/features/signature-insights/\">MetaMask Developer Documentation</a> to learn how you can build your own Signature Insight Snaps, and sign-up for our <a href=\"https://consensys.notion.site/MetaMask-Snaps-Builder-Engagement-Program-733ddd6d30df443fa6fa7920707801fa\">Builder Engagement Program</a> so we can support you on your developer journey.</p>\n<p>In the future, Signature Insights Snaps will be able to hook into alerts in signature requests.

Users can connect to any dapp, on any network, from any device. From DeFi to DeSci, gaming to NFTs, and beyond: MetaMask is deeply passionate about the web3 community. The More With MetaMask Partner Series shines a light on builders who are innovating across web3. Next up, MoonPay.</strong></p>\n<p>MoonPay is a leading crypto company that lets users buy and sell digital assets directly with their MetaMask wallet. Since MoonPay’s partnership with MetaMask began in 2022, we’ve been dedicated to simplifying the management of cryptocurrencies, while keeping users secure. Let’s dive into the ways our collaboration achieves this.</p>\n<h2>Streamlining DeFi onboarding</h2>\n<p>As the demand for self-custodial wallets has risen, so too has the need for robust and intuitive tools that give users a frictionless “web2-like” experience. In the past, the two haven’t always mixed well. Newcomers to crypto, who typically have the highest appetite for intuitive UX, tend to find DeFi overly complex.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this tension, MoonPay saw an opportunity to bridge-the-gap by providing seamless cash-to-crypto onboarding to the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, MetaMask. Integrating with MoonPay allowed MetaMask’s millions of users to interface with DeFi through familiar payment options like credit cards, debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. It also allowed MetaMask users to benefit from MoonPay’s stringent security protocols.</p>\n<h2>Simplifying ramps to protect users</h2>\n<p>One of the key advantages of the integration is that users can purchase digital assets directly within MetaMask wallet — eliminating the need to navigate multiple platforms. This approach smoothes out the process, while keeping users’ information safe. By avoiding unnecessary third-party platforms, data exposure is minimized.</p>\n<p>In addition to decreasing exposure by helping users stay within the platform, MoonPay is committed to protection and security in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our ramps are built with advanced encryption technology like AES-256.</li>\n<li>We comply with PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, and ISO 27018 standards, ensuring we meet stringent data security criteria.</li>\n<li>Our systems have undergone independent audits for PCI-DSS Level 1, ISO 27001/27018, and SOC2 Type 2 certifications, giving users peace of mind that our safety standards don’t waver.</li>\n<li>Our rigorous Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies helps prevent bad actors from entering our ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Creating a more secure web3</h2>\n<p>As we continue to work alongside MetaMask, our shared focus on safe, user-friendly solutions remains a cornerstone of this partnership. Together, we’re not only simplifying crypto onboarding for newcomers – we’re setting the bar for what it means to prioritize security in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and selling crypto with your MetaMask wallet via MoonPay has never been easier.
