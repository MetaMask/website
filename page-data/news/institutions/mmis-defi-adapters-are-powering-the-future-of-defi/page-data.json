Since the advent of yield farming kicked off the DeFi summer, we have seen an explosion of innovation that is second to none. DeFi has rebuilt the financial system from first principles. It offers basic primitives for swapping, lending, borrowing, saving, investing, options and derivatives in a transparent, interoperable, permissionless way. DeFi democratises access to these primitives for anyone, anywhere.</p>\n<p>In the traditional world, one might think of these tools as simple building blocks. DeFi takes it a step further, creating complex strategies like self-repaying loans, recursive yield strategies, the yield farming of airdrops and the ability to connect all these primitives seamlessly to achieve the highest reward rate possible. This level of innovation is generating interest from professional traders and institutions, who are stepping into on-chain in a meaningful manner for the first time.</p>\n<p>DeFi, therefore, can and has profoundly and positively impacted the world. However, navigating this complex world becomes difficult, especially when it comes to access toDeFi data. Users can stake into a decentralised exchange (DEX) to receive yield and rewards and an LP token to reflect their position. They can then lock that LP token into a vesting contract to boost their reward rate further and receive a Locked or Vested LP token. These staking, re-staking and recursive loops are common due to the interoperable nature of DeFi and can result in token exposure and claimed and unclaimed rewards several layers deep. In the world of institutions, having accurate valuations of these positions and rewards is profoundly crucial. Net Asset Values (NAV) and performance are tied to accurate marked-to-market valuations and the ability to make precise decisions based on profit, loss, and performance.</p>\n<p>Today, the challenges related to DeFi data are being solved by several players in the market, most notably through the indexing of data and tagging, labelling and categorising different smart contracts. This allows a data provider to determine the balance of a position in a pool and show the underlying token balances of a position. Despite these efforts, there is a constant race with cutting-edge users (like professional traders and DeFi Funds) to stay updated with the latest protocols.</p>\n<p>At MetaMask Institutional (MMI), we have been deeply involved with solving these data challenges. We have a user-centric culture and our product principles denote that we speak with users every day. Over the last two years, we have spent 10,000 hours in the DeFi data trenches:first building with sub-graphs; then building simulators to simulate closing position and the value of the underlying tokens; and lastly, speaking with the consumers and producers of DeFi data. Namely users who need accurate DeFi positions, and with DeFi protocols that need and want users to interact with their protocols. In conjunction with this race for data in a world of permissionless innovation, we also found:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>DeFi protocols were not being connected with users at scale</li>\n<li>There is no standard for both read and write DeFi access</li>\n<li>Few scaled approaches benefit the wider ecosystem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result, we set out to build a DeFi adapter standard that is focused on achieving the following goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provide a standardised adapter implementation specification for both read and write data.</strong> We want to enable any protocol engineer to build an adapter in less than four hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide Rich and in-depth DeFi data.</strong> We resolve an LP token into the underlying token exposure to value a position. We also offer proper time-weighted profit &#x26; loss (P&#x26;L) and return data, therefore accounting for inflows and outflows, claimed and unclaimed rewards to arrive at the correct P&#x26;L and performance position.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit the wider ecosystem</strong>. We want to create an open-source standard that benefits consumers of the data, drives users to DeFi protocols and allows anyone to fork and use the repository.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What Are MMI's DeFi Adapters?</h1>\n<p>The simplest way to think of our DeFi adapters (aptly named) is to think of DeFi as a new on-chain world with its own electricity, which is DeFi data. Our adapters are literally (and metaphorically) equivalent to adapter plugs that can take this DeFi electricity (on-chain DeFi data) and convert it into DeFi views in an easily understandable user interface. The best example of the output of this data can be found in the MMI Portfolio Dashboard, where we show rich DeFi views of the underlying token exposure.</p>\n<p>We also show P&#x26;L and performance using accurate time-weighted return calculations. This means we account for the value of a position today, the deposits (inflows) and withdrawals (outflows), and both claimed and unclaimed rewards to determine the accurate return and performance of a position over the last day, seven days and one month. The DeFi adapters will also power MetaMask Portfolio in showing DeFi data to users.</p>\n<p>We have created this standard and repository to make the DeFi adapter building as seamless as possible. When a DeFi protocol is built and adopted, its LP tokens are immediately shown in the MMI Portfolio Dashboard,  followed by MetaMask portfolio. This ensures LP tokens and positions are visible to institutions and consumers and gives a DeFi protocol broad access to the most extensive user base in crypto. Users, therefore, benefit from seeing their position, and DeFi protocols benefit from users being able to interact with accurate data.</p>\n<p>Our eventual goal is to make the adapters a standard on par with MetaMask wallet support, ensuring depth and breadth, and long-tail access to any DeFi protocol. This means we foresee a future where as soon as a DeFi protocol is created, it will immediately add support for MetaMask and build an adapter so that MMI and MetaMask users can access the DeFi protocol and also have their LP tokens shown across MetaMask and MMI user experiences. This helps us to avoid having to race our users to provide data in cutting-edge protocols, as wallet access and LP tokens support will be there since inception.</p>\n<h1>Developer Experience</h1>\n<p>With our user-centric product principles, we have built a repository with several features to empower developers to build and consume DeFi adapters. Our explicit goal is to allow any protocol engineer to spend a maximum of four engineering hours to build a new DeFi adapter.</p>\n<p>We have also created communication channels to support engineers in creating adapters. We have a seamless command line interface (CLI) that guides developers through the primitive they are building and offers existing templates that provide most of the required code. Once an adapter is built, we offer a UI for developers to review and quality assure their output. We also offer a video tutorial and an FAQ section to guide through the process and make the developer experience as simple and seamless as possible.</p>\n<p>On the consumer side of the DeFi data, besides the open-source repository, we currently offer a DeFi API with all the necessary endpoints to value positions and get profits and performance. We also offer a write endpoint to seamlessly generate transaction parameters for a wide range of DeFi protocols, therefore offering programmatic trading. Lastly, we provide a DeFi SDK with automated prompted methods for each supported protocol to empower developers to build further with our adapters.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about MMI’s DeFi API, read <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/institutions/metamask-institutional-launches-defi-apis-for-institutions/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Next Steps</h1>\n<p>Our goal is to scale the DeFi protocols that we support over the next two quarters. Our goal within MMI is to offer unrivalled access to any asset anywhere and empower institutions to monitor, manage, control and report on their web3 assets. Our open-source DeFi adapter standard has these first principles at heart and aims to empower users and DeFi protocols and benefit the wider community.</p>\n<p>If you are a DeFi protocol looking to collaborate, <a href=\"https://github.com/consensys-vertical-apps/mmi-defi-adapters\">contact us here</a>.

Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5. Connect to multiple networks:</strong> Beyond Ethereum, MetaMask supports various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible networks, allowing users to switch between networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Buy and sell cryptocurrency:</strong> Buy cryptocurrencies directly within MetaMask Portfolio using traditional payment methods such as bank transfers or credit cards, and through integrations with third-party providers like Paypal and Revoult. And if you’re ready to sell, Portfolio has you covered, simply connect your wallet and select your method to cash out.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtoymxLYQYU?si=x6sOzk8H5wfA_Mr1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDoCq5vKCBQ?si=nQ6FoN1apO9seMCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>7. Integrate with your hardware wallet:</strong> Enhance your security by connecting MetaMask to hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor from Portfolio, combining the convenience of MetaMask with the robust security of cold storage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Customize privacy settings:</strong> Adjust your privacy settings to your preference, including setting up a custom RPC for specific networks, managing connected sites, and reviewing permissions. Learn more about how to configure your privacy settings <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask/\">here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>9. Participate in staking:</strong> Stake your crypto directly through MetaMask Portfolio, participating in the decision-making processes of various protocols and earning rewards. In Portfolio, there are three options for staking, Validator, Pooled, and <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake?tab=liquid\">Liquid</a>. The below tutorials show you how easy it is to start staking based on your preference.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQRwcnQVsOE?si=ZT1ykhcORwR4DYXl\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHEymH5s97o?si=ahioErY_gO8k3xDx\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>10. Bridge tokens:</strong> Bridging tokens on MetaMask refers to the process of transferring digital assets or tokens from one blockchain network to another using MetaMask as the interface for the transaction. Bridging tokens is a powerful feature in Portfolio that enhances the interoperability between different blockchain networks, enabling users to leverage the unique advantages of each network.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1rwvBWk5XU?si=twN-RTUS1qioHW3l\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br />\n<h3><strong>Coming soon in Portfolio</strong></h3>\n<br />\n<p>Transfer assets from centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase and Binance directly to your MetaMask wallet, or between different accounts within MetaMask itself, with enhanced security and ease.
