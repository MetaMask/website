When editing estimations, we have changed terms from low, medium, high to low 🐢, market 🦊 and aggressive 🦍 respectively:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n  <li><strong>“Low“</strong> (previously “Low”): is much lower than market prices and it allows a user to pay a lower fee when they are willing to wait a longer time. It allows you to wait a longer period and skip the price spikes (i.e. save money). Note that this setting is based on past trends, which means we can never be sure the transaction goes through. If you require a transaction to go through, this may not be the right setting for you.</li>\n  <li><strong>“Market“</strong> (previously “Medium”): reflects market prices.</li>\n  <li><strong>“Aggressive“</strong> (previously “High”): is much higher compared to market prices. It allows you to set a really high max fee and priority fee to increase the likelihood of your transaction being successful if you’re expecting to participate in a gas war.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"custom-mobile-one-row-wrapper\" style=\"display: flex;\">\n  <div style=\"margin-right: 32px;flex: 1;min-width: 0;\" class=\"custom-mobile-one-row\">NOTE: As of the rollout of the EIP-1559 updates on Extension, you will have to opt-in to this new experience.

No more math required to calculate the Max Fee. Hooray!</p>\n<p><i>Why we changed it:</i><br><br>For a few reasons:</p>\n<ol role=\"list\">\n  <li>The first iteration of our EIP-1559 Advanced Settings UI turned out to be a bit too technical and not necessarily relevant for users. The new experience includes more information so it’s easier to make decisions for your priority fee and max base fee.</li>\n  <li>We know some users spend time checking gas prices with other services. Now, you no longer need to do this: we added some details below the “Max base fee” and “Priority fee” inputs that help you understand the latest gas status.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things. While we wait for Ethereum to move to Ethereum 2.0 (planned for 2022), there are solutions that solve the problem of high transaction costs: Layer 2.<br><br>Layer 2 is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/#top\">defined</a> as “a collective term for solutions designed to help scale your application by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while taking advantage of the robust decentralized security model of Mainnet”. They are networks that are built “on top” of the Ethereum blockchain that can handle transaction fees off of the original Ethereum blockchain. This alleviates the number of transactions per second made on the original Ethereum chain, or Layer 1, which allows to scale and therefore decrease the transaction, or gas costs.<br><br>We believe Layer 1 will continue to act as a valuable base issuance and settlement layer for protocol assets. Whereas, on Layer 2, developers and end-users will want to take advantage of the off-chain transactions and computations to keep the base layer free of congestion.

For example, if a block is 100% full the base fee increases by 12.5%; if it is 50% full the base fee will be the same; if it is 0% full the base fee would decrease by 12.5%.<br><br>The ongoing movement of applications to rollups and Layer 2s will greatly reduce gas fees.</p>"}},"backgroundColor":"blue"},{"__typename":"ContentfulFaq","contentful_id":"c6DML6hbPGAOHCE9ZVTZe","internal":{"type":"ContentfulFaq"},"question":"How do I set the right gas fee?","answer":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask will provide you with three options when setting the gas fee:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>“Low“</strong> (previously “Low”): is much lower than market prices and it allows a user to pay a lower fee when they are willing to wait a longer time, for example when withdrawing funds or other non-time sensitive transactions.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things. While we wait for Ethereum to move to Ethereum 2.0 (planned for 2022), there are solutions that solve the problem of high transaction costs: Layer 2.<br><br>Layer 2 is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/#top\">defined</a> as “a collective term for solutions designed to help scale your application by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while taking advantage of the robust decentralized security model of Mainnet”. They are networks that are built “on top” of the Ethereum blockchain that can handle transaction fees off of the original Ethereum blockchain. This alleviates the number of transactions per second made on the original Ethereum chain, or Layer 1, which allows to scale and therefore decrease the transaction, or gas costs.<br><br>We believe Layer 1 will continue to act as a valuable base issuance and settlement layer for protocol assets. Whereas, on Layer 2, developers and end-users will want to take advantage of the off-chain transactions and computations to keep the base layer free of congestion.

For example, if a block is 100% full the base fee increases by 12.5%; if it is 50% full the base fee will be the same; if it is 0% full the base fee would decrease by 12.5%.<br><br>The ongoing movement of applications to rollups and Layer 2s will greatly reduce gas fees.</p>"}},"backgroundColor":"blue"},{"__typename":"ContentfulFaq","contentful_id":"c6DML6hbPGAOHCE9ZVTZe","internal":{"type":"ContentfulFaq"},"question":"How do I set the right gas fee?","answer":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask will provide you with three options when setting the gas fee:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>“Low“</strong> (previously “Low”): is much lower than market prices and it allows a user to pay a lower fee when they are willing to wait a longer time, for example when withdrawing funds or other non-time sensitive transactions.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things. While we wait for Ethereum to move to Ethereum 2.0 (planned for 2022), there are solutions that solve the problem of high transaction costs: Layer 2.<br><br>Layer 2 is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/#top\">defined</a> as “a collective term for solutions designed to help scale your application by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while taking advantage of the robust decentralized security model of Mainnet”. They are networks that are built “on top” of the Ethereum blockchain that can handle transaction fees off of the original Ethereum blockchain. This alleviates the number of transactions per second made on the original Ethereum chain, or Layer 1, which allows to scale and therefore decrease the transaction, or gas costs.<br><br>We believe Layer 1 will continue to act as a valuable base issuance and settlement layer for protocol assets. Whereas, on Layer 2, developers and end-users will want to take advantage of the off-chain transactions and computations to keep the base layer free of congestion.

For example, if a block is 100% full the base fee increases by 12.5%; if it is 50% full the base fee will be the same; if it is 0% full the base fee would decrease by 12.5%.<br><br>The ongoing movement of applications to rollups and Layer 2s will greatly reduce gas fees.</p>"}},"backgroundColor":"blue"},{"__typename":"ContentfulFaq","contentful_id":"c6DML6hbPGAOHCE9ZVTZe","internal":{"type":"ContentfulFaq"},"question":"How do I set the right gas fee?","answer":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask will provide you with three options when setting the gas fee:</p>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>“Low“</strong> (previously “Low”): is much lower than market prices and it allows a user to pay a lower fee when they are willing to wait a longer time, for example when withdrawing funds or other non-time sensitive transactions.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things.
