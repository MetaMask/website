In theory, the more transactions that occur, the more deflationary pressure that the burning of the base fee will have on the overall Ethereum supply. The ETH supply may deflate more or inflate more at different times based upon the number of transactions that happen on the network.

Layer 1 has a limited number of transactions per second it can process. When it’s busy on the chain, in other words, a lot of people are making transactions at the same time, the cost of these transactions go up. This can lead to transaction costs of sometimes over hundreds of dollars. This simply isn’t worthwhile unless you’re a whale, or just plain desperate to make that transaction. Ethereum 2.0 aims to solve this problem with Proof of Stake, which allows for faster transactions amongst other things. While we wait for Ethereum to move to Ethereum 2.0 (planned for 2022), there are solutions that solve the problem of high transaction costs: Layer 2.<br><br>Layer 2 is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/#top\">defined</a> as “a collective term for solutions designed to help scale your application by handling transactions off the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while taking advantage of the robust decentralized security model of Mainnet”. They are networks that are built “on top” of the Ethereum blockchain that can handle transaction fees off of the original Ethereum blockchain. This alleviates the number of transactions per second made on the original Ethereum chain, or Layer 1, which allows to scale and therefore decrease the transaction, or gas costs.<br><br>We believe Layer 1 will continue to act as a valuable base issuance and settlement layer for protocol assets. Whereas, on Layer 2, developers and end-users will want to take advantage of the off-chain transactions and computations to keep the base layer free of congestion. That means, because of Layer 2’s unique optimizations and scaling solutions, transaction processing speeds will be faster while reducing gas fees will be lower than Layer 1.</p>"}},"backgroundColor":"blue","bordered":null}]},{"contentful_id":"22aqprbZ0fpzXRr3T6vDcU","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulModuleContainer"},"title":"Fees","description":null,"numberOfItem":null,"columns":1,"columnType":null,"columnsOnTablet":null,"centerOnTablet":null,"columnsOnMobile":null,"centerOnMobile":null,"contentAlignment":"center","splitModules":false,"displayTitle":true,"isLiquiditySection":false,"isTrustBar":null,"gridModulesGap":null,"loadMoreMode":null,"loadMoreCta":null,"carouselMode":null,"hasRegionSelector":null,"regionSelectorHeadline":null,"regionSelectorPopupTitle":null,"regionSelectorPopupText":null,"regionListKey":null,"extraData":null,"modules":[{"contentful_id":"1s3DtOtHR2cfHhfHVBKL3E","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulFaq"},"question":"Will EIP-1559 make gas fees cheaper?","answer":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>No, this is not the intent of the EIP.

There are some potential risks EIP-1559 presents to network actors that are sensitive to timing, such as oracles.

For example, Compound needs to know the valuation (i.e. price x number of assets) of a user's collateral in order to determine if their position needs to be liquidated or not. The valuation of these assets have to be constantly updated, and Compound relies on oracles to update this information.

It is what users pay to get their transaction validated, or completed.</p>\n<p><strong>MetaMask-specific Gas Estimations:</strong><br>\n<ul role=\"list\">\n<li><strong>“Low” 🐢</strong>: is much lower than market prices and it allows a user to pay a lower fee when they are willing to wait a longer time. It allows you to wait a longer period and skip the price spikes (i.e. save money). This setting is based on past trends, which means we can never be sure the transaction goes through. If you require a transaction to go through, this may not be the right setting for you.</li>\n<li><strong>“Market” 🦊</strong>: reflects market prices.</li>\n<li><strong>“Aggressive” 🦍</strong>: is much higher compared to market prices. It allows you to set a really high max fee and priority fee to increase the likelihood of your transaction being successful if you’re expecting to participate in a gas war.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Base fee: </strong><br>Generated by the protocol. Represents the minimum gasUsed multiplier required for a transaction to be included in a block (i.e. for a transaction to be completed). This is the part of the transaction fee that is burnt.</p>\n<p><strong>Max Priority fee - i.e. Priority fee or the miner’s tip</strong><br>MetaMask will initially set this amount based on the previous block’s history. However, users will be allowed to to edit this amount within the Advanced Settings. It is added to the transaction and represents the part of the transaction fee that goes to the miner.</p>\n<p><strong>Max fee:<br></strong>MetaMask will initially set this amount based on the previous block’s history. However, users will be allowed to edit this amount within the Advanced Settings. It represents the maximum amount that a user is willing to pay for their transaction (inclusive of base fee and max priority fee). The difference between max fee per gas and base fee + max priority fee is “refunded” to the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Gas limit:<br></strong>The maximum amount of gas units that the transaction may be able to consume.</p>\n<p><strong>Gwei:<br></strong>&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;Gwei is a unit of ether, the smallest denomination, which stands for gigawei (or 1,000,000,000).¹ Gwei is used for gas fees, or rather payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.²<strong>&zwj;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Slippage:<br></strong>Slippage is the expected percentage difference between a quoted and an executed price.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ol role=\"list\">\n<li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gwei-ethereum.asp</a></li>\n</ol>"}},"displayTitle":true}],"cta":null,"backgroundColor":"default","displayHeadline":false,"headlineAlignCenter":false,"contentAlignCenter":false,"headlineMarginTop0":null,"paddingTop":null,"sectionPadding":null,"noPaddingTop":null,"noPaddingBottom":false,"modulesMargin":null,"isTab":null,"moduleId":null,"customClass":null,"sideImage":null,"backgroundSize":null,"backgroundImage":null}},{"node":{"internal":{"type":"ContentfulLayoutModuleContainer"},"contentful_id":"3mcSmOdIPsT5JNhIrSoCxH","node_locale":"en-US","eyebrow":null,"headline":"Enhanced Gas UI: MetaMask is making changes to how to gas fees work across Extension (opt in at launch of Extension v10.10.0)","description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p class=\"mb-2\">*These changes will come to the MetaMask Mobile App soon.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-2\"><a href=\"#enhanced-gas-ui\">The latest changes we’ve made to how EIP-1559 gas fees works with MetaMask Extension</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-2\"><a href=\"#general-fa-qs\">General FAQs</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-2\"><a href=\"#fa-qs-for-developers\">FAQs for developers</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-2\"><a href=\"#glossary\" class=\"mb-2\">Glossary</a></p>"}},"modules":null,"cta":null,"backgroundColor":"default","displayHeadline":true,"headlineAlignCenter":false,"contentAlignCenter":false,"headlineMarginTop0":null,"paddingTop":null,"sectionPadding":null,"noPaddingTop":null,"noPaddingBottom":true,"modulesMargin":null,"isTab":null,"moduleId":null,"customClass":null,"sideImage":null,"backgroundSize":null,"backgroundImage":null}}]},"features":{"edges":[]},"featureSliders":{"edges":[]},"fullWidthCtas":{"edges":[]},"moduleContainers":{"edges":[]},"cards":{"edges":[]},"ctas":{"edges":[]},"hubspotForms":{"edges":[]},"embeds":{"edges":[]},"faqs":{"edges":[]},"logos":{"edges":[]},"richTexts":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"1BXkD177av9KMKmn4XXTpn","modules":["1DQc7wppj3xScdjSTMtZQ7","3mcSmOdIPsT5JNhIrSoCxH","7bTtEQIjEhOgat4D8NILC0","3AfCqigeSqbi8gnNGWt8Ay"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/1559/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":null,"widerContainer":null,"extraData":null,"locale":"en-US","translation":null,"node_locale":"en-US","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/security/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/"],"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"is not supported.
