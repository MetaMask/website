It’s a metaphor that refers to something that is designed to attract someone: in other words, <em>it’s a trap.</em> Sometimes security professionals actually deploy their own honeypots to try and catch bad actors. Today, we’re going to take a look at a specific type of honeypot scam: the one that looks like a delicious pot of cryptocurrency, and all you have to do is reach out and take it.</p>\n<h4>Step 1: First Contact</h4>\n<p>The scam begins with someone making contact, asking for help. In this case, the platform was Twitter, but <em>it could be anywhere</em>. We’ve also seen cases of scams happening on Discord, through peer-to-peer messaging apps, etc. Anywhere you can contact someone, really, can be the place where a scammer fishes for their next mark.</p>\n<p>I got a number of direct message requests like this one on Twitter:&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/y1_an77hHUPNGhp21qdP69z7D-T20IsUZvAdMuyeOL7kfIjyZnXwbDZkLPmVdrxNmEYURvimsyrc_tMARxURPTK19j9pCEEuUnPPpgJUVkNdPFyB0ksjyj_blcT7IoyVPwicLANA4bgUKomBmDitAbs\" alt=\"\" style=\"\" class=\"loaded-lazyload loaded-image\"><figcaption>A typical scam initiation.</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>On its face, it’s a bit weird. But in the end, it could be read like a newcomer to the space who needs help, and is naïve enough to send me, a stranger, their <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107-User-Guide-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-password-and-private-keys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">twelve-word Secret Recovery Phrase</a> in a direct message. In other words, they unthinkingly gave me ownership over <em>all their tokens</em>.</p>\n<h4>To be clear, <em>never</em> share your Secret Recovery Phrase with <em>anyone</em> unless you want them to have total control over <em>everything in your wallet</em>.</h4>\n<p>I wanted to get a closer look at how the scam works, so I <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-to-manage-multiple-wallets-with-metamask/\">created a few new browser profiles</a> that I will use for nothing else, and imported the Secret Recovery Phrases. That gave me access to the public address of the wallet, so I could <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057536611-How-to-check-my-wallet-activity-on-the-blockchain-explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use a block explorer</a> to see the contents of the wallet.</p>\n<p>The first one I opened was from a message I received about a month and a half back. The wallet had no meaningful value in it. The chain that had the most activity was Binance, and it had a zero balance in BNB, the <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gas token</a> of the Binance chain. However, I noticed a very distinctive pattern in the last transactions made on it:&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/t5W37NzCQ7DbHXsBArUll6Hk6CQqoVETdY8AOTvdTEKk7J5p7PhzaqUcZgSnA_k4vwhf2EognFr72SmmO4UUQAoLyUJqnV5s1ID9PZD710kDevHd54e-Y1Hncw5Lcxyq5LhOuw2YPEtBjJ1c61u2ReY\" alt=\"\" style=\"\" class=\"loaded-lazyload loaded-image\"><figcaption>Suspiciously small, and fast, transactions in and out of the wallet</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Tiny fragments of BNB that leave the wallet as soon as they arrive, each time from different addresses. And they always go to the same two addresses as every other outgoing transaction in the wallet’s history. Remember this pattern–we’ll come back to it.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: The Temptation of the Honeypot</h4>\n<p>The second wallet I opened up was a much more tempting prospect than the first. Again, this wallet had the most activity on the Binance chain, but this time, it had $1600 USD worth of tokens sitting in it. Sixteen hundred dollars, and I own the private keys to it.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f-ywXBireWxmPbFl2y1RIaR0cB3nEbYzRwXDC3jRE0x9GWOgWlpjdwWfZhFd4lTlo6EDJvaYLFvxbRQ0IuDSxsEjYh1Q9ibFHx6xlvGJ1ZApubHqKhj5cVJUr9K91VuMPxs5idYrO4mKzjQM38kyDPk\" alt=\"\" style=\"\" class=\"loaded-lazyload loaded-image\"><figcaption>Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Mind you, this value isn’t held in BNB; it’s in some tokens I’ve never heard of:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8HnaIYPz3wOCY2mP33nfflN9pTSH-wxjyEJbw8qGQAbjGfNE77GfiRxzbbqKQZOXqjCg2iUCCAwWj0exsTv3R5zLPkEyIrqaQd_5MMEG7SZROVoMdE9SUthrRYEdk1rJKl7JnOazHAz45piq95LbRJE\" alt=\"\" style=\"\" class=\"loaded-lazyload loaded-image\"><figcaption>Looks like I’m going to be Terk-rich</figcaption></figure></div>\n<p>Now that’s no problem, as long as the tokens have value. The most important thing now is to get those assets out of that wallet and into mine, right? All I need to do is send them to my own wallet, then I can swap them for whatever I want. The assets are on the Binance chain, which means I’ll need some BNB tokens in my wallet in order to move them. I won’t need much, so I’ll just send a bit in to pay for gas. </p>\n<p>Small up-front expense, big honeypot payoff, right?</p>\n<h4>Step 3: The scam</h4>\n<p>Remember the little transactions, earlier? Now you understand how they got into the wallet in the first place. Those are little bits of BNB that someone sends into the wallet to try to get something out. As soon as the transactions land in the wallet, they are swept out to other addresses. This is done through automated scripts that are listening for incoming transactions to the address, called <em>sweeper bots</em>. While fascinating, this topic gets technical quickly; for more in-depth information, see our resource on <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5716855323675-Fighting-back-against-sweeper-bots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fighting back against sweeper bots</a>.</p>\n<p>If I deposited some BNB into the wallet, either sending it from another wallet I control or <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058239311-How-to-buy-crypto-in-MetaMask\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buying it directly through MetaMask</a>, the bots would send it back out so fast I might not even see the value reflected in my wallet change. I would have no chance of manually executing a transaction to transfer that $1600 of tokens anywhere. They’re that quick.</p>\n<h4>Instead, the bots sweep my gas money off to someone’s wallet, along with everybody else’s who has tried to make off with the honeypot.</h4>\n<p>Does the scammer make a lot of money off of me? No. A few dollars at most. But it’s a pure numbers game. If the scammer spins up enough of these honeypot wallets and sends out enough direct messages then over time, the continuous trickle of money adds up to a stream of “passive income”. At the very least, the scammer has enough BNB to pay for whatever they want to do on chain.</p>\n<p>So, if it seems like someone’s just handed you the keys to a small fortune, or even a modest one, think again. The most likely result of messing with these scams is you waste your time and lose some money. And if you aren’t safe about the environment in which you’re doing it, you risk exposing your own wallet and keys to whatever else is <a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lurking out in the dark forest</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Lo último","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"3tzV1UgBy7rIc2pOHx30l4","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"How Did MetaMask Come To Life?

But do they know the minds behind it? In a culture that prizes bombast and Twitter flame wars, Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis take a more inquisitive and modest approach to community building. For this reason, in the six years of building MetaMask, they haven’t done many interviews—never together. “We prefer focusing our time on empowering the community. We are not the only ones behind the project, the whole community is.” While they still weigh in on important industry discourse, such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b\">Moxie’s critique</a> of Web3, or comment on the latest peer-to-peer networking and encryption libraries, they are more reserved when it comes to sharing their personal story. <em>Who are they? What's their background? How did they meet? What causes are they passionate about? How did the MetaMask idea come to life? </em>&nbsp;Like the hundreds of thousands of brilliant minds creating the everyday Web3 use cases of tomorrow, Aaron and Dan have a singular story, an unexpected journey that led them to create what is today the way millions of people worldwide access Web3.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://cdn.consensys.net/uploads/2022/07/14131738/MetaMask_Aaron-and-Dan.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25411\"/><figcaption>Aaron Davis and Dan Finlay </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Dan, an English Literature major, and Aaron, a Japanese and Chinese scholar, first met in 2013. Their divergent lives intersected while contributing to the project VoxelJS, an open-source Minecraft clone, making an environment to help kids learn to program in the browser, followed by jobs at Mochaleaf, a startup that was acquired by Apple. Each of them were on their own path and at the time, it seemed improbable that one day they would create the iconic fox.</p>\n<p>Dan was born in Detroit, briefly moved to New York, and is now settled with his wife on the Pacific Coast in California. While he is not a huge traveler, he has loved his visits to Japan and Turkey. Globetrotting Aaron on the other hand, likes to change homes frequently, but has most consistently lived around the ring of fire — Japan, China, Bali, and now Hawaii. Like a true adventurer, he is driven by curiosity and has a deep appreciation of the historical and social origins of culture.</p>\n<p>When they were children, Aaron just wanted to play video games while Dan first wanted to live in an igloo. While this made sense at the time, Dan later realized that this might be a bit complicated and then decided that he wanted to be an astronaut. Over the years, their dreams naturally evolved, and Dan ditched the igloo and rocketship ideas for art, video production, and improv. He studied English Literature at University. Aaron studied Japanese with the hopes of becoming a simultaneous interpreter. When asked about his unique career aspirations, Aaron explained, “You have to get everything out of your brain to be a conduit for translation, I found the pure alignment of mind very inspiring.” People do say that software engineering is just like learning another language; both require a sensitivity to detail, a capacity for logical construction, and comfort with semiotics. In many ways, by their early twenties, they were already halfway to their programming life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Dan, coding started more than 10 years ago with a scatological app idea: <a href=\"https://fartomin.wordpress.com/\">Fartomin</a>, a fart synthesizer. “I didn’t know how to code so I read a book to learn how to do it,” he recounts. Still staying true to his childhood dreams, Aaron tried to develop video games— “I didn’t have any guidance so I was trying to learn from what other people made, read it then tweak it.”</p>\n<p>After Dan’s diverse stints working as a portrait artist, videographer, museum docent, arcade supervisor, balloon twister, chess coach, and screen printer, his path crossed with Aaron in 2013 at Apple, after Kumavis himself retired from being a camp counselor, lifeguard, interpreter, and waiter in Japan. They both wanted to work on peer-to-peer computing, or, “crazy ambitious ideas that still resemble what we are doing,” explains Aaron.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3tUb1ifmEXTiq767kUjSNr/2bfdb41b1827005c202b59ac417b5ce3/MetaMask_Dan-and-Aaron.jpg?q=80&fm=webp\" alt=\"Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis recounting their story\" class=\"wp-image-25413\"/><figcaption>Dan Finlay and Aaron Davis recounting their story </figcaption></figure>\n<p>This sense of sharing, building a community, and creating platforms for safe collaboration is motivated by social inequality and the rights of others. Dan is captivated with human rights and connecting with people. His sense of social justice was shaped by his family’s own experiences with the Detroit auto industry collapse, and the farm worker movement in California. “I hate that we are building on years of businesses deliberately externalizing their impacts and exploiting everything they can for profit.” His first experience with community currencies came from Charquin, his alternative elementary school. If you ask Aaron what he hates the most, he’d tell you that he doesn’t want to rely on people he doesn’t trust to do things. “I hate being deprived of agency,” he says. Their aspirational and philosophical ideas around technology were converging and the idea of MetaMask was slowly coming to life.</p>\n<p>According to Aaron, “One part of tech and politics was coming through projects like torrents. People were doing something really complicated and everyone was working together to pull it off. I wanted to see how we could do it in a bunch of other ways.” This moment was before Ethereum had even launched.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the second largest blockchain was created, which put a bug in their ear. “When I heard about Ethereum and the ideas surrounding it, I thought that they fit a couple things that sounded like what I wanted to make—a modular democracy or better debate system. I wanted to use computers to help people raise funds, send micropayments, and more,” explains Dan. They knew it would be cool to have a website backed by the Ethereum network, but how the login would work was unclear. Web-based crowdfunding was still kind of new. Aaron was interested in crowdfunding a project on Ethereum and worked backwards from there. He spent a while making a sophisticated account manager that was like a browser within a browser, and then, Dan came in. While there were many early in-person hacking sessions, they also developed a way of working across timezones that in some ways represents the collaborative efforts of building a decentralized technology like Ethereum. Together, they reduced the initial scope of MetaMask, and pivoted to making a web extension. This helped get it just good enough to start taking it to hackathons and getting developers to play with it.</p>\n<p><strong>In 2016, MetaMask and the fox were born.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://cdn.consensys.net/uploads/2022/07/14131638/MetaMask-PR.png\" alt=\"MetaMask story: 6th anniversary\" class=\"wp-image-25410\"/></figure>\n<p>Why a fox? Aaron wanted an animal mascot and had the idea of a low-poly fox. “The fox for me invokes a number of things: the folk hero of Disney’s Robinhood, rebellion against tradition, the clever solitary creature as an image of self-custody, a chance encounter in the dark forest, and solving the problem of safe collaboration or how we can trust each other.” When Dan saw the idea, he worked with a local modeler to make it 3D, and then made it interactive. They also needed a name…</p>\n<p>Aaron likes naming things but he also knows that it’s hard to get it right. He spent a lot of time reflecting on a name that we now know as MetaMask and described, “I wanted something that matches the purpose, rolls off the tongue nicely, and mostly passes the “phone test”: can you say it over the phone and can they write it down?” Meta means self-referential. Mask, as in a decorative or drama mask, is a metaphor for identity.” MetaMask was meant to mean, “the identity of your identities,” or, “the thing you use to manage your many identities.” Needless to say, the appellation stuck, and in the 2020s, is rather clairvoyant given Facebook’s rebrand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It’s been a hectic and unique journey for the team. When looking back, some memories that stand out include staying up all night during the rise of CryptoKitties in 2017 to come up with a way to alleviate the stalled transactions. “I also remember our retreat in 2018 when we first started talking about how we would scale the product, and let users add new networks.” In 2019, the Snaps project came to life. “2020 was a huge dramatic year where we first started seeing the new ways in which scammers phished our users’ Secret Recovery Phrases, but then shipped the Swaps feature that gave us our first actual revenue, and allowed us to hire more reliably.” 2021 was a year of rapid growth, laying the foundation for MetaMask's most ambitious plans. 2022 has been a year of building the systems and teams MetaMask needs to fulfill users’ needs more completely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dan and Aaron both share the belief that we should establish new trust foundations. Dan stated, “Today, most people neither know how to trust computers, nor each other. The internet has shattered our sense of unity. I want to leave people feeling like they are able to trust more things again, but for the right reasons.” Looking at the future, Aaron is convinced that, “most things in Web3 that are popular now won't be around in 20 or 30 years,” so he tracks the themes and forms, not the specifics. His goal for Web3 is to build a “civilization starter kit.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“Do you ever feel like society is starting to collapse? Let's have a large-scale backup plan.”</p>\n<p>They are both deeply convinced that MetaMask is all about the community that is building the future features of the wallet through MetaMask Snaps.&nbsp; If they were to give one piece of advice to developers, Dan says, “It’s all about finding a way to serve the rest of humanity. Focus on the problems people have, listen to people, learn how things work, and then see if you can make life a little easier for someone. Along the way, you might discover things that would make things easier for you to make things easier for them, and those are also valid ways to build, but you have to start with something you care about doing for someone else.” Aaron invites developers to, “try lots of things. Have faith you can figure out how to do something if you put in the time.” </p>\n<p>Because you—we—are building the future.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Lo último","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":"https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/how-to-manage-multiple-wallets-with-metamask/","isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2X05GCxstnCbz9nqihorlz","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"How to Manage Multiple Wallets with MetaMask","slug":"how-to-manage-multiple-wallets-with-metamask","subtitle":"If you’re new to Web3, you might still be getting used to using MetaMask and managing your new online identity and assets.","image":{"title":"Manage Multiple Wallets with MetaMask","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=webp 1920w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=3840&h=2160&q=80&fm=webp 3840w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=480&h=270&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=960&h=540&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 1920w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4PdBNrXLS8hEEsEvhE9RxS/97d7e6c70db5390275a5f42c25adb790/How-to-Manage-Multiple-Wallets-with-MetaMask_Hero.jpg?w=3840&h=2160&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 3840w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"July 12, 2022","authors":null,"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If you’re new to Web3, you might still be getting used to using MetaMask and managing your new online identity and assets. But if you’ve been around a while, you may be juggling several different Secret Recovery Phrases. That can get complicated, but there are ways to make it easier from a usage perspective. Let’s take a dive into how to manage multiple wallets without losing your mind.</p>\n<h4>But why?</h4>\n<p>Why would you want, or need, multiple <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404722782107-User-Guide-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-password-and-private-keys\">Secret Recovery Phrases</a>? After all, each SRP can generate a near-infinite number of accounts, so you can just organize your tokens and assets at the account level, right?<br><br>Well, there are actually a lot of potential use cases and avantages. First of all, if your SRP becomes somehow compromised, <em>all</em> the accounts generated using that SRP are compromised. Some users who are interested in engaging with cutting-edge, unproven dapps and platforms prefer to have their riskier behavior ‘sandboxed’ in a separate wallet.</p>\n<p>Another reason to employ multiple SRPs is so that you can have a ‘public’ identity as well as more anonymous identities; if you want to try out a platform without associating it publicly through on-chain data with your publicly-known identity, an alternate SRP is a straightforward way to do it.</p>\n<p>Another common scenario is that of entrepreneurs or businesspeople; they may have personal wallets and business wallets. It is, of course, good business practice to keep these separate. However, there’s a practical side to it as well: if you need to report your crypto holdings to tax agencies, it’s much more convenient to have a separate SRP for each taxable entity.</p>\n<p>Last but not least: some people have several different <em>versions</em> of MetaMask installed at the same time. A developer may be working with a custom build they’ve created themselves, or making beautiful new functionality for MetaMask in our developers' distribution, <a href=\"https://metamask.io/flask/\">Flask</a>. An institutional investor may be working with our enterprise-tailored <a href=\"https://metamask.io/institutions/\">MetaMask Institutional</a>, perhaps with several different wallets. Developers often have SRPs specifically for development, which they use to deploy smart contracts. Under these circumstances, you have to be very careful to have <strong>only one version of MetaMask active in the same browser at the same time, or it won’t work.</strong></p>\n<p>These are some of the most common scenarios, and this list is by no means exhaustive. So enough about the why; how do these crypto-connoisseurs manage it all?</p>\n<h4>Secret Recovery Phrase hygiene and safety</h4>\n<p>The first step to managing <em>any</em> Web3 identity is to practice good SRP hygiene and safety. This is what we mean:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>“Not your keys, not your coins”</strong>: the old Bitcoin maxim holds true on other blockchains, as well. <strong>Never, ever, <em>ever</em> share your Secret Recovery Phrase</strong>. Anyone who has that phrase has complete and irrevocable control over the accounts generated with it. Never share it–<em>especially</em> if they say they’re trying to help.</li><li><strong>Secure backups</strong>: If those twelve words represent total control over your accounts, how do you keep them safe <em>and</em> accessible at the same time? <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432\">We’ve got a whole article on SRP security</a>, but these points bear repeating:&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DO:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Write down your Secret Recovery Phrase somewhere safe</li><li>Double-check your spelling and that you wrote down every word in the same order they were given</li><li>Reach out to MetaMask Support's <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058230211\">official channels</a> if you need help</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DON’T:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keep it in an easily discovered location; e.g. in a cloud-saved document or email titled \"Seed Phrase\"; on a post-it note stuck to your computer.</li><li>Provide your seed phrase to anyone, even if they say they're from MetaMask Support</li><li>Change the order of the words</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Consider getting a hardware wallet</strong>. This adds a layer of complexity to your SRP management, so if you’re thinking about it, read our <a href=\"https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5450173968283-User-Guide-How-to-use-a-Hardware-Wallet\">hardware wallet configuration recommendations here</a>.</li><li>Lastly: if a sidechain (like <a href=\"https://wallet.roninchain.com/\">Ronin</a>, for example) requires you to set up a new wallet, consider whether you want to re-use an existing SRP, or generate a new one. Pro tip: it would be safer to generate a new one.</li></ul>\n<p>Follow these guidelines, and you’re well on your way to staying safe in Web3.</p>\n<p><strong>So without further ado: <em>how do I hold all these SRPs??</em></strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\" style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ikEw3xRrslLKhcTQyM_T4Z8nSO7lYgvKPDFUcEuICnLhXoH9MIvq0Jiybe7R3dH6_OVRVFEa9frE_UvQD--M0BFwpuStw8h2CqHNdhGulwGwsAEnfnEcpMKDBm4LWN2Z3CmNcAEh4_CwlQi9Mw\" alt=\"Juggling multiple wallets and Secret Recover Phrases\"/></a><figcaption><em>So many <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\">BIP-39</a> compliant words</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>There are two main ways to do it: use different browsers, or set up different <em>browser profiles</em>. Don’t worry, it’s fairly easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Using different browsers</strong></p>\n<p>This option is as straightforward as it sounds: if you’ve only got two or three SRPs, then <strong>you can simply install MetaMask in several different browsers, and use a different browser for each one.</strong> Given the open-source nature of the modern web, there’s not a definitive listing of browsers that it will or won’t work in. The browsers officially supported by MetaMask at press time are Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Using browser profiles</strong></p>\n<p>The easiest way to manage multiple wallets is by using <strong>browser profiles</strong>.

This technology streamlines cross chain activity from L1 → L2, L2 → L2, L2 → L1, and even L1 → L1. In today’s tutorial, we take a look at trustless interoperability protocol Connext, which facilitates bridging and cross chain dApp deployment.</p>\n<h4>Why Connext?</h4>\n<p>Connext enables fast, non-custodial communication between chains and <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-l222-means-for-the-ethereum-ecosystem/?utm_source=consensys&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=connext_education\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rollups</a>. Their bridge protocol currently supports the transfer of funds between 17 networks. Unlike most other interoperability systems, Connext enables this without introducing any new trust assumptions or external validators, making the system <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/your-crypto-needs-a-secure-way-to-travel-heres-why/?utm_source=consensys&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=connext_education\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more secure than architectures</a> that use external validators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They also suggest that “bridging is just the beginning of the story” in the next paradigm shift of Web3 interoperability, prompting them to launch an extensive toolkit not merely limited to bridges, but also cross chain dApp implementation. Builders can execute instructions from one central xApp (pronounced zap)—a decentralized app that performs operations between independent chains—instead of deploying on multiple chains.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this post, we’ll dive into the bridging component of their tech stack.</p>\n<h4>Sending Assets Using Connext</h4>\n<p>Ready to bridge your assets over?

The Router will send the intended amount to Alice on the destination chain minus a fee. Now Alice is fine, but how does the Router get the money back?</li><li>Under the hood and on the source chain, the Connext Smart Contract will forward Alice’s funds to the Nomad Smart Contract. The Nomad Smart Contract batches several transactions together into an update in the form of a merkle tree and the root of the tree is signed by the Nomad Updater.</li><li>When signed, the update is being sent to the destination chain to another Nomad Smart Contract. Now, the Nomad Watcher has 30 minutes to step in if the update is fraudulent. The watcher can compare the state at home and the signed state and will detect fraud.&nbsp;</li><li>If nothing is fraudulent, then the Connext Router can claim its tokens back on the destination chain using the proof that it has already sent tokens to Alice in Step 2.</li></ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DCNJgvCwt_LzzUOr09O46porJaiVzEHJPpR-tH_D_VeEG1nx7Qovon_iUoB93C8LiJ5yfB8XVj4Gtmw2EFYnxvyfSYFOLvgoW3oJAq3qrkUFA2e3wYDapCZVEHIwmjy1wpHYJ-8UAKbqDBsALw\" width=\"624\" height=\"325\"></p>\n<p>Connext Routers need to stake tokens ($NEXT) in order to participate in the network and earn a proportional share of work from the network in return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“NEXT keeps the network running by ensuring that all routers are beholden to the same set of rules around fair transaction ordering, and a router’s NEXT is slashed if they violate these rules.” – <a href=\"https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397\">What’s $NE</a><a href=\"https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">X</a><a href=\"https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397\">T?</a></p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>\n<p>Connext’s extensive list of networks is likely to keep growing and they allow you to bridge cheaply and rapidly without introducing any new trust assumptions.
