How do I do it?</a></em>\n<em>If you’re unfamiliar with the topic of staking, start there.</em></p>\n<p>What are staking withdrawals? Well, to summarize: there are lots of things that people call “staking”; and in those situations where you’ve locked up tokens, or staked them, generally there’s a mechanism through which you can withdraw those deposited tokens, and get them back into an account you control. Usually there’s a button in the interface of the staking app UI that says “Unstake”, or “Withdraw”, or something to that effect; you sign a transaction, pay the gas, and you get your coins back.</p>\n<p>That hasn’t been the case with true, Ethereum network-level staking, however. Take a look at our previous explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Wait… What about when someone wants to pull out their ETH?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Liquid staking providers don’t currently offer this functionality, because they can’t. When the Ethereum network made the switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, they focused on getting Proof of Stake running properly first, before moving on to the process by which users could withdraw already-staked ETH. For now, all staked ETH remains staked.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Withdrawal functionality is scheduled to be released in <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/450\">the Shanghai upgrade</a>, which could happen during 2023. In the meantime, users wishing to get rid of their liquid staking tokens and “change them back” to ETH would have to do so through a swap, which they can do right from their MetaMask wallet by clicking or tapping the “Swap” button.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>That Shanghai upgrade we mentioned? Well, it’s right around the corner: at time of writing, <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2023/03/28/shapella-mainnet-announcement\">scheduled for April 12th</a>.</h4>\n<br>\n<h3>What happens when I withdraw my stake?</h3>\n<p>The concept is simple, and it’s like we stated previously: <strong>you get your ETH back in an account you control</strong>. How that happens, and what’s involved, will vary widely depending on the way you staked your ETH. Let’s take a look at some nuances:</p>\n<h4>MetaMask Staking in the Portfolio Dapp:</h4>\n<p>If you are a holder of Rocket Pool or Lido liquid staking tokens (rETH and stETH, respectively), you will be able to process your withdrawals through the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake\">MetaMask Staking</a> feature of the Portfolio Dapp. Rocket Pool withdrawals are expected to be available as soon as the Shanghai upgrades have completed; Lido is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LidoFinance/status/1635739571227951117?s=20\">currently implementing withdrawals</a>, and we plan to support them in MetaMask Staking as soon as we can. In the meantime, you can <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11834605248923-How-do-I-withdraw-my-stake-and-rewards-\">swap your stETH for ETH</a>, such as with MetaMask Swaps, if you wish.</p>\n<p>Once the Shanghai upgrade goes live, you’ll still be able to swap your rETH or stETH for ETH, or other tokens, the way you can now. In addition, though, <strong>you’ll be able to use the protocol’s staking withdrawal mechanism right from Portfolio Dapp</strong>: you don’t even need to go to their website to process a withdrawal. Our full walkthrough on how the process works <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/11834605248923\">will be available here</a>, in case you get stuck.</p>\n<p>You also have the ability to stake more ETH in those protocols right from Portfolio Dapp, as well as swap them for other tokens, including ETH, even before the Shanghai upgrade occurs. For more information on this, we’ve got <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/sections/10505259606555-MetaMask-Staking\">a whole section of articles</a> explaining it all.</p>\n<p>If you’re unclear on what “liquid staking” is, check out <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/what-is-staking-how-do-i-do-it/#liquid-staking\">our section on the topic</a> in our previous article.</p>\n<p>One advantage of liquid staking is that you can decide how much to withdraw without worrying about keeping a validator node running; Rocket Pool and Lido take care of that. On the other hand–the more ETH we all collectively stake, the more secure the network is as a whole.</p>\n<h4>Custodial staking</h4>\n<p>If you’ve staked ETH with a custodial provider, such as a centralized exchange (CEX), you’ll want to be looking for communications from them about what the process will be like. Remember–if you’ve staked with a custodial provider, you’re relying on them to keep your stake safe, as opposed to self-custodial options, where <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212-MetaMask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet\">you always hold the keys to your accounts</a>.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that, if you staked with a custodial provider, it’s possible that you’ve been given a liquid staking-style token in return, which that exchange has indicated is equivalent to the value of the ETH you staked. For example, <a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/cbeth/using-cbeth\">Coinbase offers a token called cbETH</a>.</p>\n<p>If you, in fact, hold some liquid ETH staking tokens, such as Lido or Rocket Pool, you can stay up to date on your balances and your corresponding portion of the rewards earned by the protocol in the MetaMask Staking feature of the Portfolio Dapp (<a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake\">portfolio.metamask.io/stake</a>).</p>\n<h4>Self-custodial</h4>\n<p>There are some providers whose setups allow you to stake full nodes, and still maintain custody of your keys. Again, how these individual providers will enable withdrawals will likely vary from one to another.</p>\n<p>At our own <a href=\"https://consensys.net/staking/\">ConsenSys Staking</a>, for example, we will be offering users the ability to withdraw their stake both through a UI flow, as well as through API functionality. Users of MetaMask Institutional will also have the ability to process withdrawals from ConsenSys Staking as well as Allnodes, Blockdaemon, and Kiln, through their powerful <a href=\"https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-launches-the-first-marketplace-for-institutional-staking-on-metamask-institutional-in-partnership-with-allnodes-blockdaemon-and-kiln/\">Staking Marketplace</a>.</p>\n<p>Again–consult with your provider, and keep in mind the particularities listed below under “Self-run nodes”; depending on how your staking setup works, you may have some additional steps to enable withdrawals.</p>\n<h4>Self-run nodes</h4>\n<p>If you personally are<a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node/\"> running your own node</a> and staking through it, either on your own computer or through a cloud service provider, then there are some things you should be aware of:</p>\n<p>First, the caveat surrounding your node’s address credential type. This is technical, and has to do with changes that have been made to Ethereum address structures in the past few years, but it boils down to the fact that more than half of current stakers will need to take action to change to a different address format in order to withdraw their stake. For more detailed information on this, check out ConsenSys’ <a href=\"https://consensys.net/shanghai-capella-upgrade/#updating-withdrawal-credentials\">Ultimate Guide to ETH Staking Withdrawals</a>.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware of the two different types of withdrawals that will become available: <strong>full</strong> and <strong>partial</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full:</strong> Just like it sounds, a full withdrawal is, essentially, ceasing to be a validator. You’ll be pulling the full ETH balance out of your node or nodes, and shutting down your node. In other words, <strong>32 ETH x number of nodes + accumulated staking rewards.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Partial:</strong> With partial withdrawals, you will be able to <strong>withdraw ETH that your node has accumulated</strong> in terms of rewards–but <strong>leaving intact the requisite 32 staked ETH</strong> so that your node continues running.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re running a node, or want to know more about how this will work, check out <a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq#Q-What-are-the-two-types-of-withdrawals\">the Ethereum Foundation’s FAQs on withdrawals</a>.</p>\n<h3>Keeping your stake, and your accounts, safe</h3>\n<p>There is a lot of conversation going on–in the news, on social media, and company blogs like this one–about the Shanghai upgrade. Big changes in Ethereum protocol like this always bring with them the opportunity for scammers that will try to trick you out of your ETH, and anything else you have in your wallet.</p>\n<h4>So remember: <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/12683145255835-I-received-an-email-claiming-to-be-from-MetaMask-Is-it-legit-\">MetaMask will NEVER email you or DM you</a>.

They are a framework through which we can build extremely powerful and fine-tuned collaborative systems, and all that detail and structure is public. Systems this complex exist all around us, and we interact with them every day. But we’re not used to seeing their bones and veins; we’re used to being provided with a simplified version, “the part that concerns us”.</p>\n<h4>Complexity is one thing; the user experience of something being complicated is a completely different matter. It is incumbent upon those building the interactive tools and experiences of any system to take the complex, and make it make sense.</h4>\n<hr>\n<p>The process of understanding enough to even interact with public blockchain networks often requires reading arcane, technical texts and absorbing abstract mathematical concepts. With a learning curve this steep, those of us trying to make this technology make sense to users find ourselves in the position of providing education and training as often as actual technical support. As any teacher can tell you, that’s not easy, and it’s not quick.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a step back, though: these new technologies offer an incredible opportunity from the perspective of support and privacy. We have, already, a database of all the actions a user has taken on any of their accounts, actions which can be recognized and categorized using software, saving countless hours of manual lookup on the part of the Support agent and the customer.</p>\n<p>What’s more, we can have access to this information without the customer ever providing us with their name or their email address; the only thing we need is their public account address.</p>\n<p>With this, we can provide live, contextual support for their specific issue while preserving their anonymity. We have no access to, authority or permissions over their accounts; we get only the information we need, and the power stays with the customer. This is the vision we have of the future of customer support which we have begun to build.</p>\n<h4>A user should not have to sacrifice their privacy simply to have their tech work properly, or to understand how to use it; nor should they sacrifice at the level of user experience. With the tools we have, we can provide contextually-driven information not only on par with traditional infrastructure, but superior to it.</h4>\n<hr>\n<p>The beginning to all this–the first step in this transformation of the power dynamics between customer and provider–is <a href=\"https://activity.metamask.io\">MetaMask Activity</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4X7R7LGEFXM3vcq4LeJvFK/d3ae54e59bba34d412dbbdc5c5edbd0f/MMA_Connect_Wallet.png\" alt=\"connect wallet\"></p>\n<p>All MetaMask Activity needs to work is a public account address, entered either by typing it, copy-pasting it, or authenticating using MetaMask.</p>\n<p>The user is then presented with a readout of the transaction history of the account in question. Going much farther than the standard “ledger-style” account readout, the app categorizes the transaction type and provides the user with information specific to the type of transaction they performed.</p>\n<p>For example, the common DeFi flow of approving a DEX to have access to your tokens, then swapping with that token:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1UxjODH4CT0QSijwmIMTZQ/7c9c2e3e9f03189c5484cd33f4f438a7/MMA_approval_and_swap.png\" alt=\"MMA approval and swap\"></p>\n<p>Or another favorite, minting NFTs:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/ZdV9t911KHfFqGqLlpmn7/71096a97d18b52f82c41ffe54fd8c749/MMA_NFTs.png\" alt=\"MMA NFTs\"></p>\n<p>Notice that failed transaction, showing up in red.</p>\n<p>Off the top of my head, it looks like the user smashed that “mint” button twice in a row, and only one transaction went through. But the user doesn’t have to take my word for it; they can click through to the article, or copy-paste the transaction hash (its unique ID) and search for more details on Etherscan:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5VY4x3lGBwR8JHxvcRp3ra/6befeb087afce1fb798aa7872cdba5cf/MMA_copy_transaction.png\" alt=\"MMA copy transaction\"></p>\n<p>And yes, ERC-1155 tokens are supported:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/ciGksL2x9UcHgyRv2en2B/96e1b797fdf9064979087485e72ce178/MMA_purchase.png\" alt=\"MMA purchase\"></p>\n<p>…as well as a wide variety of ERC-20 tokens:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/571uKAIV0bhGkCsWyDssMc/977fa1d904bc04e81e1f7709bf65f20d/MMA_send_and_receive.png\" alt=\"MMA send and receive\"></p>\n<p>MetaMask Activity has an additional tool which helps users chase down transactions that go wrong. Transactions that fail, get stuck, or are pending for long periods of time:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jZn6vELjAHgj1YGyeHc3B/4e983ab46b056394662949c8a6bccbb1/MMA_transaction_pending2.png\" alt=\"MMA transaction pending2\"></p>\n<p>This initial version of MetaMask Activity offers this functionality on Ethereum Mainnet, and it sets the stage for functionality that can be built on top of it: address-authenticated, transaction-specific Support chat; multi-chain analysis; the potential for more advanced features like dapp permissions management and assisted account migration tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The idea for MetaMask Activity originated in a conversation between a Help Desk team manager, a product manager on our team, and myself, a technical writer. Our Support agents were spending massive amounts of time helping customers find, and understand how to look at, their own transactions on the blockchain; both the customers and the Support teams desperately needed a tool to help them.</p>\n<p>What took this concept to the next level was ConsenSys’ internal hackathon, in the spring of 2022. A team of five volunteered to build it, from all over the world, and all over the company: engineers, a marketer, a project manager, and myself.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a work week, we built not only a functional proof of concept of this application, but were able to communicate the ways that it would improve the working conditions of Support agents, reduce the average time to resolution of Support tickets, and empower users to self-solve and learn about this technology. Additionally, it would be a first-of-its-kind application showing the benefits of open blockchain networks for something as normal and day-to-day as customer support.</p>\n<h4>Our project won that hackathon, and ConsenSys stood by one of its core values of “embracing innovation” by funding the project. A little less than a year later, that same project manager and the team that built the application are delivering this product to MetaMask users.</h4>\n<hr>\n<p>We hope that MetaMask Activity gives you some insight into what’s going on with your accounts and transactions, and how this technology works. We’re very much focused on the long-term potential of this product, and remember: if you get stuck, we’re only a few clicks away.</p>\n<p>Try it out here: <a href=\"https://activity.metamask.io\">activity.metmask.io</a></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Lo último","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5ZE7ZJtyPw8pj76eTB8Pt8","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Mobile and Extension updates improve wallet experience with more control and transparency","slug":"metamask-mobile-and-extension-updates-improve-wallet-experience-with-more-control-and-transparency","subtitle":"With its latest updates, MetaMask Mobile improves load times, browser navigation, and account connectivity; MetaMask Extension enhances the onboarding experience with more privacy settings to limit data exposure.","image":{"title":"feature improved load times","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=248&h=165&q=80&fm=webp 248w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=496&h=331&q=80&fm=webp 496w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=992&h=662&q=80&fm=webp 992w","sizes":"(min-width: 992px) 992px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=992&h=662&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=248&h=165&q=80&fm=png 248w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=496&h=331&q=80&fm=png 496w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=992&h=662&q=80&fm=png 992w","sizes":"(min-width: 992px) 992px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1281}},"publishDate":"March 14, 2023","authors":null,"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask recently pushed updates on its mobile app and browser extension to improve load times and optimize the wallet experience.

We hope you enjoy the new experience!</p>\n<p>And if you have any feature requests, let us know <a href=\"https://community.metamask.io/c/feature-requests-ideas/13\">here</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Lo último","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/es/news/page/13/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/security/","/news/institutions/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":48,"categoryId":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","category":"","totalItems":66,"currentPage":13,"totalPages":17,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"no es compatible.
