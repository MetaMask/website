But even with the Seal 911 group of auditors and white-hat hackers that was created last August, are we anywhere close to ready for the carnage that might come with the next bull run? Monahan talks about the dangers of bad actors ranging from \"script-kiddies'' to APTs, and the lack of accountability when protocols get hacked.

The email service provider MailerLite, allegedly hacked, is currently investigating the issue. The phishing emails contained malicious links leading to a multi-chain address. WalletConnect and other Web3 users have been targeted with emails promoting a launchpad launch and a fake Token Terminal beta launch, both containing links to fictitious airdrops. Cybersecurity platform Hudson Rock suggests that a malware program found on a MailerLite employee's computer might have been used to gain access to MailerLite’s servers for data theft and further attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To enhance protection against phishing attacks, users should approach unsolicited emails with caution, regularly update and run antivirus software, and <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/19878220833947-How-to-turn-on-Blockaid-security-alerts\">enable Blockaid security alerts</a> in their MetaMask settings.

This is a common campaign that scammers with a good understanding of Ethereum smart contracts use to spoof Etherscan logs. The scam involves sending airdrops that appear to come from reputable sources to token holders, who are then directed to a fraudulent website where they are tricked into authorizing the attacker to drain their wallets. The scam is sophisticated, utilizing complex smart contract interactions and a proxy contract to obfuscate the true nature of the transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users should approach unsolicited airdrops with caution, scrutinize embedded links in digital assets, and understand the implications of interacting with smart contracts. Users should stay informed about scam tactics, use trusted tools for verifying transactions, and double-check sources of airdrops or transactions. Safe browsing practices and securing assets, such as using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, are recommended. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, education, caution, and skepticism remain key defenses against potential threats.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://securelist.com/new-macos-backdoor-crypto-stealer/111778/\">Cracked Software Loaded with Backdoors to Steal Cryptocurrency</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Kaspersky discovered a sophisticated macOS malware campaign that targets users through cracked apps found on pirating websites. The malware, embedded in repackaged pre-cracked applications, initiates an infection through a Trojan proxy and a post-install script. The malware is capable of running on macOS Ventura 13.6 and later, suggesting a focus on users of newer operating systems. The malware uses a program named \"Activator\" to execute its payload, which includes stealing cryptocurrency wallets. The malware campaign is still a work-in-progress, with the operators frequently updating the malicious scripts. The final payload is a backdoor that can run any scripts with administrator privileges and replace Exodus and Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet applications with infected versions that steal secret recovery phrases.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To safeguard against malware attacks, users should strictly download and install applications from official platforms or trusted third-party app stores, avoiding unverified or pirating websites.

The bridge between HTX and Ethereum was exploited, with large amounts of ether, tether (USDT), and a wrapped version of bitcoin (HBTC) transferred to an unused Ethereum wallet. Blockchain security firms CertiK, Peckshield, and Cyvers suggest the bridge's private key was likely compromised. HTX Global's two hot wallets also lost funds. This incident follows a pattern of security issues in blockchain projects associated with board member Justin Sun, including a recent 100 million exploit at Poloniex, an exchange Sun acquired.

This attack compromised their npm credentials. npm, or Node Package Manager, is a tool for importing open-source software libraries, broadly used across the web development industry, as well as web3.</p>\n<p>This attack allowed a malicious version of the library in question to be published. This library is included in a live-updating manner via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in many web apps in the Ethereum ecosystem. This resulted in malicious code being injected into those web apps.</p>\n<h2>How do we prevent this? LavaMoat.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat\">LavaMoat</a> is a set of tools built specifically to help address the software supply chain security issues web application developers face.</strong></p>\n<p>LavaMoat offers protections against supply chain attacks at three different points in the software development lifecycle: <strong>at the time of dependency install</strong> (when you’re importing all those libraries), <strong>at build time</strong> (when the app is being prepared for serving over the Internet), <strong>and at runtime</strong> (when the built application is running).</p>\n<p>LavaMoat is unique in its <strong>runtime protections</strong>. There are other tools that can be used during development, such as <a href=\"https://snyk.io/\">snyk.io</a>, which only provides warnings of known vulnerabilities, or <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>, which provides more comprehensive code analysis, and does not wait for experts to report findings to a central database. <strong>These scanning tools perform an invaluable role</strong>, and we recommend you use <a href=\"https://socket.dev/\">socket.dev</a>’s GitHub Integration.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>they are unable to provide any runtime guarantees.</strong> For this reason, we find using them alone to be insufficient.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat’s security protections derive from <strong>only delegating specified capabilities</strong> to dependencies of your application.</p>\n<p>What does that mean? Well, read on, and check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Bz0DYga1k&#x26;ab_channel=EthereumFoundation\">Devcon 6 talk</a> for a deeper understanding of how LavaMoat works and how it is used.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5Bz0DYga1k?si=xqyZEWdI7k1arwZf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<h2>An Object Capability primer</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>You can think of a system having <strong>capabilities</strong>: things it can do, like showing information, reading locally stored data, or making requests to other systems like web requests to servers or transaction requests to wallets, and the ability to <strong>delegate</strong> these capabilities to others.</p>\n<p>When delegating a capability, you can provide a limited or restricted version of the capability. This is known as <strong>attenuation</strong>.</p>\n<p>These three components form the basis of the <strong>object capability security model</strong>. By using this model, you can understand who has the ability to do what.</p>\n<h2>Web application security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Browsers do a decent job of sandboxing applications; that is, keeping them separate and preventing them from interfering with your computer or other websites.</p>\n<p>However, they don't provide robust building blocks for web app developers to further sandbox specific portions of their app, which could keep certain components of their app from compromising the whole application.</p>\n<p>For this reason, when importing a library into your application, you are effectively <strong>delegating all capabilities to that library</strong>. This is further complicated by the fact that <strong>most JavaScript libraries bring in not just their own code but a collection of libraries written by various authors.</strong></p>\n<h2>Ledger attack specifics</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>The <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> library is Ledger’s recommended way of integrating with their products. This package is a thin wrapper that loads the latest version of their library from a CDN.</p>\n<p>While this means your app will always have the latest version of the library it also means __you are effectively delegating control of your web app to the Ledger loader library, which in turn delegates it to the code hosted on the CDN. __</p>\n<p>You can model the delegation chain like this:</p>\n<h4><strong>Web App → <code>@ledger/connect-kit-loader</code> → jsDelivr CDN → npm → Ledger → Ledger ex-employee → attacker</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>Even this is a simplification. Zooming in on one component, <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/network/infographic\">such as the jsDeliver CDN</a>, can reveal a dazzling complexity of additional services that are also part of the supplychain and potential footholds for launching an attack.</p>\n<h2>Securing applications with Object Capability Security</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>While browsers themselves don't provide much tooling, as mentioned, for limiting the capabilities of subcomponents of an application, the JavaScript language is actually well suited for the task.</p>\n<p>JavaScript, with some careful effort, allows you to build Compartments, which limit what code is allowed to access. See Agoric’s <a href=\"https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses\">Hardened Javascript</a> effort for an implementation of Compartments.</p>\n<h4><strong>MetaMask’s <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/\">LavaMoat</a> supply chain security system and the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a> plugin system both build on Compartments to achieve confinement.</strong></h4>\n<br /> \n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7nIGWogOGAO7RpDLKoqcyS/f83a7d548ee2e47734c74865becb7d25/lavamoat_mystic_1.png\" style=\"max-width: 70%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0px;\">\n<br />\n<h2>Would LavaMoat have prevented the Ledger supplychain attack?</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Asking if LavaMoat would have prevented it is kinda like asking if the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SYLAi4jwXcs?t=140\">stop-when-touched feature</a> on a table saw would help if you held on to the saw while jumping off a cliff - yes, your fingers would likely remain attached to your hand after the jump.</p>\n<p>In principle, the way <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> works forces the app developer to forgo many of established security best practices. But not all hope is lost.</p>\n<p>The best way to let LavaMoat (and other supply-chain security tools) help you would be to use the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit directly</code>, without handing all control off to the loader.</p>\n<p>LavaMoat was designed to mitigate attacks like the <a href=\"https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-event-stream-incident-45653ecbda99\">Copay wallet hack</a>, also known as “the event-stream incident”, and protects well against it. So, how does LavaMoat fare against this different attack?</p>\n<p>The answer is, unfortunately, the age old “it depends”. LavaMoat is a tool for application developers, not library developers, due to the way it integrates in the app runtime. This means that while some webapps could have protected themselves with LavaMoat, applications without\nLavaMoat would still be vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Additionally, LavaMoat only enforces a policy specified by the developers. <strong>If you specify an unsafe policy, LavaMoat will not be able to protect you.</strong></p>\n<h2>Let's look at how an application with LavaMoat could have been protected from this attack.</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>LavaMoat uses a policy file to determine what capabilities, in the form of global platform APIs, a dependency should get. To make this easier, you can have LavaMoat analyze a package and automatically determine what a package seems to need in order to operate. This is known as <strong>static analysis.</strong></p>\n<p>While static analysis is an imperfect means of understanding what some code is trying to do,  <strong>LavaMoat only uses static analysis for convenience</strong> to help you generate a policy file. It does not use static analysis to enforce its policies at runtime. The generated policies are then reviewed, tweaked, and approved by the developer.</p>\n<p>For the original question, one answer is: <strong>Yes, LavaMoat can protect your app and your users from supply chain attacks</strong>, by preventing packages from having the capability to load new code at runtime. It can protect you if you have configured it correctly and if you used dependencies that don’t demand overly powerful capabilities.</p>\n<p>Another answer is: No. <strong>If you had configured LavaMoat to allow <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to operate normally and <a href=\"https://github.com/LedgerHQ/connect-kit/blob/e4e5f5bb3ca13a28921d7357778f132e22ae4c49/packages/connect-kit-loader/src/index.ts#L98-L107\">inject a script tag</a> running any code it likes</strong> outside of the LavaMoat runtime, <strong>the attack still would have succeeded.</strong> This is part of LavaMoat’s compromise between backwards compatibility and a safer system. LavaMoat is very flexible in order to be maximally compatible, so you can drop it in your app without rewriting it from scratch. The responsibility is still on the app developer to set sensible policies and choose sensible dependencies. LavaMoat allows you to selectively provide global browser APIs, but some global APIs simply contain too much power to safely give to a third party package. We’re researching a few different means of further limiting these powers, but making something that just works for packages that make no effort to limit their control is challenging.</p>\n<p>One of LavaMoat’s features, called <a href=\"https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/blob/main/docs/scuttling.md\">Scuttling</a>, would interfere with both the malicious and the original package as loaded by the <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code>. Scuttling removes access to capabilities for code running outside the LavaMoat sandbox. This would prevent you from using the unsafe <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit-loader</code> to begin with, and push you towards directly using and thus owning the process of updating <code>@ledgerhq/connect-kit</code>, ensuring you maintain full control of the code run in your app.</p>\n<h4>While LavaMoat is not a silver bullet, it gives you control and visibility where you would otherwise have none.

Anytime an exchange is holding your crypto, they have full custody of how it can be handled. Always remember: “Not your keys, not your coins.”</p>\n<p>For developers, admins, and any parties responsible for managing the wallets of other users: It’s important to incorporate the use of multi-signature wallets. In order for an attacker to successfully compromise the multi-signature wallet, every key manager would have to be compromised significantly reducing the risk of an attack.</p>\n<h4><strong>Executives Lured on 'Business Trip' to Montenegro; Abducted and Forced to Empty Wallets.

Your granny, barber, or best friend from high school may be impressed but loose lips dramatically increase your threat profile.</li>\n<li>Diversify when reasonable, keeping different amounts in appropriate places. Connect a hardware wallet to MetaMask to achieve a good security balance for many activities. Then research and consider multisig and/or paper wallets not connected in any way to your identity that are only known by the people you trust most. For multisigs, keep geographic distance and necessary opsec between keyholders.</li>\n<li>Don’t allow direct access to more funds than you need to transact with or can afford to lose on devices you carry on you (laptop/phone). Heading on vacation and don’t plan to use/trade anything from your large cold wallet? Leave absolutely everything needed to access it somewhere safe while you’re gone, and definitely don't bring it on the trip.</li>\n</ul>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"es","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Seguridad","slug":"security"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/es/news/security/page/3/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/security/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":8,"categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","category":"security","totalItems":33,"currentPage":3,"totalPages":9,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"no es compatible.
