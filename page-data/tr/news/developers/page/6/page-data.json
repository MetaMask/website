Okonkwo","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"kingsley-okonkwo"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Connext, the modular interoperability protocol that pioneered Chain Abstraction, is dedicated to streamlining the user experience in the blockchain ecosystem by abstracting away the complexities associated with using multiple blockchains.</p>\n<p>The Connext protocol, built on <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea zk-EVM</a>, achieves this through various initiatives, including the xERC20 token standard and <a href=\"https://docs.connext.network/usecases/chain-abstraction\">chain abstraction toolkit</a> – all geared towards minimizing the need for users to understand or even be aware of the underlying networks they are interacting with. In short, Connext simplifies cross-chain transactions and enhances accessibility to make blockchain technology more approachable for the average user. At the core of <a href=\"https://www.connext.network/\">Connext</a> are two important protocols.</p>\n<p>The first is the underlying messaging layer that reads the state from multiple rollups while bridging and batching them into one combined statement, similar to how rollup sequencers work. This ensures that any information available to any chain is available to other chains.</p>\n<p>The second component is the intent protocol, which allows a Connext user without funds on chain A to complete a transaction using external liquidity from third-party market actors (solvers) on that chain. This way, the Connext user does not need to consider the overhead of bridging their tokens from chain B to chain A but can express intent, and a solver will step in on their behalf to fund the transaction immediately and get repaid by the protocol later.</p>\n<h2>The challenge of bridging tokens across multiple chains in web3</h2>\n<br />\n<p>ERC-20 tokens were never designed to be bridged. Instead, they were intended to reside on a single chain, which is why they don’t have inherent mint or burn functions. When an ERC-20 token is bridged today, behind the scenes, the token is locked into a bridge while the bridge mints an attestation of the locked token on another chain. This means that if the bridge gets hacked and funds are drained, the value of the ERC-20 token will no longer be backed, causing the attestation to lose its value.</p>\n<p>Another challenge involves bridging project-specific ERC-20 tokens, which has been historically challenging due to low adoption and immense liquidity requirements. Users can use a canonical bridge to make tokens interoperable or available across different chains, however, this requires that other bridges acquire the native token of the canonical bridge to interact with r tokens.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, using a third-party bridge would limit users to a single ecosystem and base a project's security entirely on that bridge. All these solutions are not ideal and place limitations on projects.</p>\n<h2>xERC-20 token standard and how it enables interoperability</h2>\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.xerc20.com/\">xERC-20</a> is a standard that solves this problem by providing optionality; instead of locking ERC-20 tokens into a bridge, you lock them into a 'lockbox', which is essentially a wrapper contract. This wrapper contract then mints an xERC-20 token with both a burn and mint function, allowing bridges to manage these actions efficiently. Because these ERC-20 tokens on L1 are locked into a lockbox, on L2, you can have a consistent representation, meaning that irrespective of the L2 you’re using, you will end up with the same token.</p>\n<p>This solution isn’t novel, as it has been technically feasible for some time. However, the issue with this solution lies in the security risks it introduces, where multiple bridges control the minting of your token, exposing it to security issues should one of the bridges get hacked. xERC-20 addresses this security issue by introducing minting limits, where an issuer can assign adjustable limits to the number of tokens a bridge can mint.</p>\n<h2>Get started building in web3 with MetaMask Developer</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Are you a web3 developer building consumer dapps?</p>\n<p>MetaMask Developer suite, comprising the MetaMask Wallet API, SDK, web3 service APIs, and Snaps, offers a comprehensive set of tools for onboarding millions of the web’s most engaged users.

It shines in web applications focused on speed and performance, as well as for developers who prefer a modular and innovative approach to Ethereum interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Benefits and Tradeoffs of Ethers.js and Viem</h2>\n<br />\n<h3>Ethers.js</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broad range of features and strong community support.</li>\n<li>High stability and reliability derived from its maturity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Potentially overwhelming for projects that do not require its extensive feature set.</li>\n<li>Managing dependencies and external providers can add complexity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Viem</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Efficient and lightweight, perfect for performance-sensitive applications.</li>\n<li>Simplifies the development process with its modular design and clear documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less mature than Ethers.js, with a smaller community and fewer resources.</li>\n<li>May require more effort to manage due to its unopinionated, modular nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Technical differences between Ethers.js and Viem</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Below is an enhanced comparison table between Ethers.js and Viem, featuring code examples and brief explanations for various functionalities. This comparison highlights the structural and conceptual differences in how each library approaches interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/gPkqNQLgWilGa72fPIaeJ/9fe91dfbaa53ea86791e55a499f5c2ef/FULL_CHART.png\" alt=\"FULL CHART\"></p>\n<h2>Other things to keep in mind</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Terminology and Conceptual Clarity:</strong>\nThe term \"provider\" is widely used in web3 development but can often lead to confusion due to its overloaded meaning. Viem addresses this by employing the term \"Client,\" categorizing them into Public Client (for blockchain information access), Wallet Client (for transaction signing), and Test Client (for local node testing). This distinction helps developers better navigate the Ethereum interaction landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Bundle Size and Efficiency:</strong>\nViem is designed with a minimalist modular architecture, boasting a bundle size of only 35kB. This contrasts sharply with Ethers.js, which, due to its broader range of built-in functionalities, results in a larger bundle size and potentially impacts web application performance more significantly.</p>\n<p><strong>API Design and Development Experience:</strong>\nViem opts for verbose APIs, prioritizing flexibility and ease of change. This approach stands in contrast to Ethers.js, which may employ more abstracted APIs for some functionalities, potentially making it harder to modify or extend the codebase. Additionally, leveraging TypeScript, Viem provides strongly typed APIs, enhancing the development experience through features like autocomplete, type inference, and static validation. This reduces the chance of runtime errors and makes the API more intuitive.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Each library offers a distinct approach to interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Ethers.js tends to abstract complexities through predefined classes and methods, aiming for an object-oriented experience. In contrast, Viem opts for a more function-driven interface, emphasizing explicitness and perhaps offering a slightly steeper learning curve but greater flexibility in certain contexts.</p>\n<p>Ethers.js is geared towards developers seeking a comprehensive toolkit for complex dApps, offering a rich set of abstractions and functionalities. On the other hand, Viem caters to those who value efficiency, modularity, and a minimalist design, providing a streamlined and innovative approach to Ethereum development. The choice between the two ultimately rests on the developer's or project's specific requirements and preferences.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Geliştiriciler","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"Viem vs. Ethers.js: A Comparison for Web3 Developers","metaDescription":" This blog explores the differences, benefits, and trade-offs between Ethers.js and Viem for building dapps on Ethereum","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"4RICfERXaFar2RGrgBwkpl","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Top Three Libraries for Web3 Developers ","slug":"top-three-libraries-for-web3-developers","subtitle":"This MetaMask Developer blog explores some of the top libraries for Ethereum development and their key features for web3 developers.","image":{"title":"Top Three Libraries for Web3 Developers image","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=webp 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=png 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=png 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7t9AQWheLm0YLt1Qv1OHeK/2f435081b6f7c1e236399a04438739f8/Top_Libraries_for_Web3_Developers.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=png 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"May 13, 2024","authors":[{"name":"Kingsley Okonkwo","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"kingsley-okonkwo"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Web3 libraries are essential for dapp development on Ethereum as they offer tools to interact with Ethereum nodes, manage transactions, and integrate with smart contracts using a few lines of code.

Today, smart contracts can only access public off-chain, real-time, and historical on-chain data. However, the value and importance of users' personal data, such as social security numbers, bank statements, personal identification documents, etc., have been proven in the Internet economy. Yet, these types of private off-chain data are not readily available to smart contracts due to the risks associated with putting them on the public blockchain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://padolabs.org/\">PADO</a> has built the infrastructure and tools that will allow users to securely import their private off-chain data from any internet data source into web3, using Multiparty Computation—Transport Layer Security (MPC-TLS).</p>\n<p>PADO also enables users to safely use this data on third-party dapps in a trustless manner, while providing dapps with the tools to verify the authenticity and validity of users' data without revealing sensitive information or raw details to these dapps. PADO achieves this by employing modern cryptographic technologies like Interactive Zero-Knowledge (IZK) Proofs and Zero-Knowledge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (zkFHE).</p>\n<p>In this blog, we will explore how MetaMask Developer is helping PADO Labs get to market and scale quickly through the <a href=\"https://consensys.io/fellowship\">Consensys Fellowship</a>, a <a href=\"https://linea.mirror.xyz/gNleczm8540Zf_J_jyKymCvPGRdsYn9bJZke6UYU960\">partnership with Linea</a>, and the use of our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">developer tools</a>.</p>\n<h2>How PADO is building a ZK attestation protocol for web3</h2>\n<p>The first step for PADO to successfully onboard users and enable them to own and securely manage their private data in this new system is to assign them an Ethereum account. Since many of these users will be non-web3 natives, PADO needs to emphasize security at all stages of the user onboarding process. According to PADO, the best approach would be to completely own and manage the onboarding and authentication process to better uphold the desired level of security.</p>\n<p>However, considering its current stage, PADO wanted to focus on building cryptographic algorithms to enable users to handle their private data securely instead of building and managing its wallet infrastructure.</p>\n<p><em>“A decision we made very early was that we did not want to invest our time in building the infrastructure to generate and manage users' private keys or custody their tokens in a way that assured users of their safety. We wanted to focus on building tools to handle users' private off-chain data securely.”</em>— Dr. Xiang Xie, Founder of PADO Labs.</p>\n<p>PADO also needed to invest heavily in web3 education as a Go-To-Market strategy since an average web3 user wouldn’t be enthusiastic about sharing their private data on-chain without sufficient education and security guarantees. This also meant that PADO needed to target and tap into an existing and mature web3 user base to get to market fast and scale.</p>\n<p>PADO also faced challenges related to access to funding and partnership opportunities within the ecosystem and mentorship from experienced builders who could provide technical advice.</p>\n<h2>Scaling the PADO protocol faster with MetaMask Developer</h2>\n<p>By integrating with the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/metamask-wallet-api-build-power-dapps-with-web-3-s-leading-wallet/\">MetaMask Wallet API</a>, PADO provided a seamless onboarding experience for its users while leveraging MetaMask's years of industry experience in web3 security and tapping into the expertise of seasoned in-house JavaScript security experts. Additionally, MetaMask’s ethos of being open-source and permissionless, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/what-are-metamask-improvement-proposals-and-how-to-create-them/\">MIP</a> and <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/what-are-metamask-snaps-a-developer-intro/\">Snaps</a>, meant that PADO could easily extend the features of MetaMask by either contributing directly to the Wallet API or by building third-party permissionless Snaps.</p>\n<p><em>“For us, integrating with MetaMask was a no-brainer. We considered how extensive and supportive MetaMask is with Snaps, which made the decision easy. For example, we can build a custom Snap so that PADO users on MetaMask would not need to switch between extensions during the onboarding process but can instead start and finish their interaction on the MetaMask wallet”</em> - Xiang Xie, Founder of PADO Labs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3avx9Mm5p8kGf5ay82bTA5/2d090d0c25b4d617c63f65bd2a377b4c/image2.jpg\" alt=\"PADO architecture\"></p>\n<p>Through the Consensys Fellowship and Linea Voyages, MetaMask Developer was able to help PADO quickly scale and gain 200k users by including them in the Linea Proof of Humanity Voyage and connecting them with MetaMask's large user base.
