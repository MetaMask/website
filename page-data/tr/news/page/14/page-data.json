Activity</a>.</em></p>\n<p>When I talk to people who aren’t “into crypto”, there’s a clear theme: “It’s really complicated; I don’t understand; there’s so much, I wouldn’t know where to start.”</p>\n<p>It’s true, there is a lot of complexity in decentralized ledger technologies. They are a framework through which we can build extremely powerful and fine-tuned collaborative systems, and all that detail and structure is public. Systems this complex exist all around us, and we interact with them every day. But we’re not used to seeing their bones and veins; we’re used to being provided with a simplified version, “the part that concerns us”.</p>\n<h4>Complexity is one thing; the user experience of something being complicated is a completely different matter. It is incumbent upon those building the interactive tools and experiences of any system to take the complex, and make it make sense.</h4>\n<hr>\n<p>The process of understanding enough to even interact with public blockchain networks often requires reading arcane, technical texts and absorbing abstract mathematical concepts. With a learning curve this steep, those of us trying to make this technology make sense to users find ourselves in the position of providing education and training as often as actual technical support. As any teacher can tell you, that’s not easy, and it’s not quick.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a step back, though: these new technologies offer an incredible opportunity from the perspective of support and privacy. We have, already, a database of all the actions a user has taken on any of their accounts, actions which can be recognized and categorized using software, saving countless hours of manual lookup on the part of the Support agent and the customer.</p>\n<p>What’s more, we can have access to this information without the customer ever providing us with their name or their email address; the only thing we need is their public account address.</p>\n<p>With this, we can provide live, contextual support for their specific issue while preserving their anonymity. We have no access to, authority or permissions over their accounts; we get only the information we need, and the power stays with the customer. This is the vision we have of the future of customer support which we have begun to build.</p>\n<h4>A user should not have to sacrifice their privacy simply to have their tech work properly, or to understand how to use it; nor should they sacrifice at the level of user experience. With the tools we have, we can provide contextually-driven information not only on par with traditional infrastructure, but superior to it.</h4>\n<hr>\n<p>The beginning to all this–the first step in this transformation of the power dynamics between customer and provider–is <a href=\"https://activity.metamask.io\">MetaMask Activity</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4X7R7LGEFXM3vcq4LeJvFK/d3ae54e59bba34d412dbbdc5c5edbd0f/MMA_Connect_Wallet.png\" alt=\"connect wallet\"></p>\n<p>All MetaMask Activity needs to work is a public account address, entered either by typing it, copy-pasting it, or authenticating using MetaMask.</p>\n<p>The user is then presented with a readout of the transaction history of the account in question. Going much farther than the standard “ledger-style” account readout, the app categorizes the transaction type and provides the user with information specific to the type of transaction they performed.</p>\n<p>For example, the common DeFi flow of approving a DEX to have access to your tokens, then swapping with that token:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1UxjODH4CT0QSijwmIMTZQ/7c9c2e3e9f03189c5484cd33f4f438a7/MMA_approval_and_swap.png\" alt=\"MMA approval and swap\"></p>\n<p>Or another favorite, minting NFTs:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/ZdV9t911KHfFqGqLlpmn7/71096a97d18b52f82c41ffe54fd8c749/MMA_NFTs.png\" alt=\"MMA NFTs\"></p>\n<p>Notice that failed transaction, showing up in red.</p>\n<p>Off the top of my head, it looks like the user smashed that “mint” button twice in a row, and only one transaction went through. But the user doesn’t have to take my word for it; they can click through to the article, or copy-paste the transaction hash (its unique ID) and search for more details on Etherscan:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5VY4x3lGBwR8JHxvcRp3ra/6befeb087afce1fb798aa7872cdba5cf/MMA_copy_transaction.png\" alt=\"MMA copy transaction\"></p>\n<p>And yes, ERC-1155 tokens are supported:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/ciGksL2x9UcHgyRv2en2B/96e1b797fdf9064979087485e72ce178/MMA_purchase.png\" alt=\"MMA purchase\"></p>\n<p>…as well as a wide variety of ERC-20 tokens:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/571uKAIV0bhGkCsWyDssMc/977fa1d904bc04e81e1f7709bf65f20d/MMA_send_and_receive.png\" alt=\"MMA send and receive\"></p>\n<p>MetaMask Activity has an additional tool which helps users chase down transactions that go wrong. Transactions that fail, get stuck, or are pending for long periods of time:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/jZn6vELjAHgj1YGyeHc3B/4e983ab46b056394662949c8a6bccbb1/MMA_transaction_pending2.png\" alt=\"MMA transaction pending2\"></p>\n<p>This initial version of MetaMask Activity offers this functionality on Ethereum Mainnet, and it sets the stage for functionality that can be built on top of it: address-authenticated, transaction-specific Support chat; multi-chain analysis; the potential for more advanced features like dapp permissions management and assisted account migration tools.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The idea for MetaMask Activity originated in a conversation between a Help Desk team manager, a product manager on our team, and myself, a technical writer. Our Support agents were spending massive amounts of time helping customers find, and understand how to look at, their own transactions on the blockchain; both the customers and the Support teams desperately needed a tool to help them.</p>\n<p>What took this concept to the next level was ConsenSys’ internal hackathon, in the spring of 2022. A team of five volunteered to build it, from all over the world, and all over the company: engineers, a marketer, a project manager, and myself.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a work week, we built not only a functional proof of concept of this application, but were able to communicate the ways that it would improve the working conditions of Support agents, reduce the average time to resolution of Support tickets, and empower users to self-solve and learn about this technology. Additionally, it would be a first-of-its-kind application showing the benefits of open blockchain networks for something as normal and day-to-day as customer support.</p>\n<h4>Our project won that hackathon, and ConsenSys stood by one of its core values of “embracing innovation” by funding the project. A little less than a year later, that same project manager and the team that built the application are delivering this product to MetaMask users.</h4>\n<hr>\n<p>We hope that MetaMask Activity gives you some insight into what’s going on with your accounts and transactions, and how this technology works. We’re very much focused on the long-term potential of this product, and remember: if you get stuck, we’re only a few clicks away.</p>\n<p>Try it out here: <a href=\"https://activity.metamask.io\">activity.metmask.io</a></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"En Yeniler","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"5ZE7ZJtyPw8pj76eTB8Pt8","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Mobile and Extension updates improve wallet experience with more control and transparency","slug":"metamask-mobile-and-extension-updates-improve-wallet-experience-with-more-control-and-transparency","subtitle":"With its latest updates, MetaMask Mobile improves load times, browser navigation, and account connectivity; MetaMask Extension enhances the onboarding experience with more privacy settings to limit data exposure.","image":{"title":"feature improved load times","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=248&h=165&q=80&fm=webp 248w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=496&h=331&q=80&fm=webp 496w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=992&h=662&q=80&fm=webp 992w","sizes":"(min-width: 992px) 992px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=992&h=662&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=248&h=165&q=80&fm=png 248w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=496&h=331&q=80&fm=png 496w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5NZC0INu7EspKd26GYPUld/ce9d4f337c63d49c25f51733ef44f7ee/feature_improved_load_times.png?w=992&h=662&q=80&fm=png 992w","sizes":"(min-width: 992px) 992px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1281}},"publishDate":"March 14, 2023","authors":null,"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MetaMask recently pushed updates on its mobile app and browser extension to improve load times and optimize the wallet experience.

The new mobile permission updates put privacy at the helm as you <strong>reduce unnecessary exposure</strong> to dapps and external services.</p>\n<p>💡 <strong>Pro tip</strong>: Connect to your <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io\">favorite dapp</a> in the mobile browser or learn core crypto concepts with <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Learn</a> on the go. 🤳</p>\n<h3>MetaMask Extension</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>We’ve updated the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask extension</a> to maximize the control you have over your data, and limit the amount of user data sent to third-party services that are required to run the extension.</p>\n<p>The primary changes to the wallet experience are during onboarding and within the “Security and Privacy” settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are prompted to confirm the first three words of your <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-era-of-digital-identity\">Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP)</a> when creating a MetaMask wallet</li>\n<li>You can choose any RPC provider during onboarding and opt out of our default, Infura.</li>\n<li>You can disable certain features that send requests to third-party APIs under the “Advanced configuration” settings, giving you more control over your data. These options are on by default as they are additive to the experience, but can be turned off for any reason:\n<ul>\n<li>Incoming Transactions</li>\n<li>Phishing Detection</li>\n<li>Choosing custom network</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>More Control</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>MetaMask aims to be the standard bearer across crypto wallets for user privacy and security. Data exploitation goes against MetaMask core values. Instead, we believe in equipping our community with the founding principles that guide our development—<strong>true ownership and privacy</strong>.</p>\n<p>We believe that part of the value MetaMask offers is the freedom to exit the product anytime. <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-self-custody-wallet\">Self-custody</a> means you truly control your private key, and can import that private key to any wallet interface that supports the standard Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP).</p>\n<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users so that you will not, and ultimately, cannot be exploited by yet another centralized entity.</p>\n<p>The enhanced MetaMask Mobile UI makes navigating web3 on the go easier, and the evolved MetaMask Extension privacy opt-ins give you more agency over your data. We hope you enjoy the new experience!</p>\n<p>And if you have any feature requests, let us know <a href=\"https://community.metamask.io/c/feature-requests-ideas/13\">here</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"En Yeniler","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"1PelB5Li4ENerfiYqWAz1w","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Bridges Launches Support For L2 Networks Arbitrum and Optimism","slug":"metamask-bridges-launches-support-for-l-2-networks-arbitrum-and-optimism","subtitle":"MetaMask Bridges concludes beta phase in stable production environment with L2 support, increased transfer limits, and fee enablement","image":{"title":"MetaMask Bridges","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=360&h=240&q=80&fm=webp 360w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=720&h=480&q=80&fm=webp 720w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=1440&h=961&q=80&fm=webp 1440w","sizes":"(min-width: 1440px) 1440px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=1440&h=961&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=360&h=240&q=80&fm=png 360w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=720&h=480&q=80&fm=png 720w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/zwYfsgdoDqv9xfG9c8U5S/58dff81e1b43d13c1a04add81b51e0b6/MetaMask_Bridges.png?w=1440&h=961&q=80&fm=png 1440w","sizes":"(min-width: 1440px) 1440px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1281}},"publishDate":"February 22, 2023","authors":[{"name":"MetaMask","createProfilePage":null,"profileUrl":"metamask"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>After three successful months, MetaMask is proud to conclude the bridging beta period and introduce <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge\">MetaMask Bridges in production</a>, with enhanced Layer 2 support.</p>\n<p>This brings the bridge aggregator to six supported networks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Optimism</li>\n<li>Binance Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n<li>Avalanche</li>\n</ol>\n<p>MetaMask Bridges supports bridging of up to $50,000 (previously $10K) per transfer of ETH/WETH, common stablecoins (eg: DAI), and native gas tokens (eg: MATIC).</p>\n<p>Available on <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/\">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, MetaMask Bridges is one of many helpful features that make participating in web3 easily accessible.

Through engaging lessons and interactive simulations, it helps you understand what web3 is, why it matters, and how to get started.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is for you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve been interested in web3 but just don’t know where to start</li>\n<li>You’ve bought some crypto on an exchange but don’t know what to do with it</li>\n<li>You still don’t understand web3 principles because they’ve been too jargon-heavy</li>\n<li>You want to know what the fuss about web3 really is</li>\n<li>You just want to keep up with your friends who babble about this new digital era and its possibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list could go on. But at its core, Learn is designed for anyone who wants to take the leap to explore uncharted waters. At a self-moderated pace, you can jump into any and all lessons that interest you, interact with features in the simulation, and experience those satisfying “ah-ha” moments when you finally grasp important concepts. As you may have heard, crypto wasn’t created to make you rich, it was created to set you free.

As the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, we’ve seen a lot and recognize the steep learning curve when it comes to learning web3 concepts for the first time.</p>\n<p>In Gemini’s 2022 Global State of Crypto <a href=\"https://www.gemini.com/gemini-2022-state-of-crypto-global.pdf\">survey</a>, respondents were nearly twice as likely to say that more educational resources would help them get started with crypto (40%), compared to recommendations from friends (22%).</p>\n<p>If you’ve been looking for a place to send your family and friends to the next time you’re sharing your enthusiasm for web3, have <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> up your sleeve!</p>\n<p>In addition to helping educate more people in the space, we want to help combat scammers who prey on unsuspecting victims by equipping you with the fundamental knowledge to understand self-custody and true ownership.</p>\n<p>If you feel more confident in navigating the web3 waters after MetaMask Learn, we did our job. Pssst, never ever ever share your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) with anyone. Or click on weird links. <em>Just had to get that out there.</em></p>\n<h3>It Takes A Village</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Encompassing moments of delight throughout the experience, we want to thank our partner in this project, <a href=\"https://www.stinkstudios.com/\">Stink Studios</a> for bringing MetaMask Learn to life.</p>\n<p>The amount of successful scamming and phishing attempts reduce significantly when we equip people with knowledge.</p>\n<p>We collaborated with great organizations in the space that will all use MetaMask Learn as one of their go-to web3 onboarding guides.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6csGV1uy43SKECcotf0TjB/13b66ddd871677c0618a180f3e1e6741/MM_Learn_Partners_Feb_2023_Final.png\" alt=\"MM Learn Partners Feb 2023 Final\"></p>\n<p>From celebrating diverse communities and encouraging inclusivity with <em>Women of Web3, Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow, Crypto Tech Women, Women in Tech, the Ukraine Government, and Giving Block</em>…</p>\n<p>To welcoming the next wave of creators, artists, and gamers in the world of NFTs with <em>Animoca, Unity, and Sandbox</em>…</p>\n<p>And overall building more awareness around self-custody with <em>ENS, Moonpay, Transak, Sardine</em>…</p>\n<p>Thank you for the work that you do.</p>\n<p>To the dapp developer, NFT creator, and DAO steward reading this, <strong>add this to your onboarding guide</strong> for a frictionless experience for your new users.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is there to inspire you to learn about the new world we’re in.
