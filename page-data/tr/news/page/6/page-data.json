Security researcher ZachXBT shared a leaked message from an Inferno Drainer Customer group chat. It notified customers that the attacker had updated all customer addresses to the attacker's address. This means customers who performed a successful phishing attack on March 18 had the stolen funds redirected to the attacker's address instead of their customer's address.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Although this was related to an off-chain compromise, the original $2.5M came from victims of phishing attacks. Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">FTX and BlockFi users targeted in Email Phishing Campaign</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6BYDqB0JH0XweutJH4gsUy/3d91e6a33851bb1699815776f5d9f5d9/Screenshot_2024-04-01_at_12.45.45_PM.png\" alt=\"blockfi scam\"></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>FTX and BlockFi users lost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">more than US$ 7 million</a> on the Ethereum mainnet the week of March 18 as they were targeted in a phishing campaign.

Many users signed a malicious signature or interacted with a malicious contract, resulting in their wallets being drained of crypto assets. It’s reported that the email list used in this campaign likely came from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mailerlite-confirms-hack-crypto-phishing-email-3m-attacks\">the Mailerlite compromise</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when receiving emails asking them to connect their wallets and sign transactions. To prevent being scammed by impersonators, it is recommended that users check official communications from the organization. A simple search on BlockFi’s and FTX’s websites would have revealed that no official announcement allowed users to withdraw funds. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio’s MakerDao-Based Contract Exploited for $16M</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On the weekend of March 23rd <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio Ecosystem broke the news</a> that their MakerDao-based smart contracts on Ethereum were exploited. This resulted in a total loss of over $16M in crypto assets. All contracts on Polkadot and the Curio Chain itself remained secure. Curio recently posted its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1772354849029464278\">recovery strategy</a> roadmap, highlighting that 100% of funds will be restored to users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone who was a holder of Curio’s governance token was impacted. Unfortunately, this is a scenario where a user would not have been able to protect themselves from this attack, as it involved a vulnerability within Curios’ smart contracts. For those of you who are protocol developers, you can help prevent these attacks by ensuring your smart contracts are thoroughly audited. It's a best practice to have your smart contracts audited continuously with new releases. After completing an audit, projects should participate in a bug bounty program to incentivize researchers to find vulnerabilities in their contracts before threat actors do.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Güvenlik","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"En Yeniler","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: March 2024","metaDescription":"Lots of exciting activity from ETHDenver and some new snaps additions are covered in this month’s installment.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"6IlBXud5IyKQJ2CiERQucs","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Mobile now integrated with Ledger Nano X","slug":"metamask-mobile-now-integrated-with-ledger-nano-x","subtitle":"The hardware wallet is finally bluetooth compatible with your MetaMask mobile app for a more convenient self-custody experience.","image":{"title":"MetaMask Mobile now integrated with Ledger Nano X","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=webp 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=480&h=270&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=960&h=540&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/25vo4kmfPZeaWrk5u0Ly9m/061317e186b50f178adbd36150339774/MetaMask_Mobile_now_integrated_with_Ledger_Nano_X.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&fl=progressive&q=80&fm=jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"March 7, 2024","authors":[{"name":"Megan Dias","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"megan-dias"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>We know this has been a long time coming so thank you for your patience. <strong>MetaMask Mobile and Ledger are now integrated. 🎉🎉🎉</strong></p>\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2WTaW8nvoZRYbqNabx1bXm/b620cac7d0b14863293f1ca14f131c19/memes_finally_peace.jpeg\" style=\"max-width: 60%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px 0px;\">\n<p>As some of the oldest, most trusted wallets in web3, we’re excited to offer a new and convenient solution for our mobile users.</p>\n<p>The exciting milestone follows efforts in September ‘23 to educate people on the merits of self-custody and security.

This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>.

SEAL represents a joint endeavor by the cybersecurity community to enhance safety within the crypto ecosystem. It has been operating quietly for a while, leading notable efforts such as SEAL 911 (a rapid-response help desk staffed by leading security experts) and SEAL Drills (which offers attack simulation training).</p>\n<p>The alliance has also announced its Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement, which acts as a framework for ethical hackers and MEV bots that intervene in public security incidents. In compliance with all aspects of the agreement, they are permitted to preemptively address exploits, provided that any funds are redirected to a specified location and an active attack is in progress.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://t.me/investigations/94\">22+ LastPass Hack Victims Lose 6.2M in Crypto Assets</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>@Zachxbt and @Tayvano have identified additional victims of the LastPass hack in <a href=\"https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\">December 2022</a>. Between February 19th and 20th, over 22 victims of the LastPass hack suffered losses totaling US$6.2 million. The stolen funds were quickly transferred from EVM chains to Bitcoin.

From September 2023 until January 2024, MetaMask's Monthly Active Users surged by +55%, signifying a crucial phase for web3.</p>\n<p>While it’s a promising sign of growing web3 adoption, we need to ensure that our users are equipped to keep journeying through this burgeoning crypto space because the scammers don’t sleep.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Attack vectors affecting DeFi are sophisticated and diverse, with hackers exploiting both on-chain and off-chain vulnerabilities.

Remember, <strong>when in doubt, just don’t interact.</strong></p>\n<h3>Establishing new security standards</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>A 2023 survey conducted by Morning Consult for Consensys revealed that 76% of participants prioritize security when selecting a wallet. Just as the transition from HTTP to HTTPS introduced a security standard that protected users and built trust in the internet, the web3 ecosystem needs similar protective measures tailored to our unique environment. This involves tools and protocols that alert users to potential security risks associated with certain dapps—Blockaid’s research finds that 1 in 10 dapps are malicious—ensuring that only secure and verified transactions take place.</p>\n<p>For web3 to move beyond this interesting corner of the internet and become mainstream, users need to feel confident that their assets and data are secure.
