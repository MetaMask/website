Security researcher ZachXBT shared a leaked message from an Inferno Drainer Customer group chat. It notified customers that the attacker had updated all customer addresses to the attacker's address. This means customers who performed a successful phishing attack on March 18 had the stolen funds redirected to the attacker's address instead of their customer's address.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Although this was related to an off-chain compromise, the original $2.5M came from victims of phishing attacks. Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">FTX and BlockFi users targeted in Email Phishing Campaign</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6BYDqB0JH0XweutJH4gsUy/3d91e6a33851bb1699815776f5d9f5d9/Screenshot_2024-04-01_at_12.45.45_PM.png\" alt=\"blockfi scam\"></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>FTX and BlockFi users lost <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Plumferno/status/1771346180615577621\">more than US$ 7 million</a> on the Ethereum mainnet the week of March 18 as they were targeted in a phishing campaign. The specific threat actor, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x6C0e83422cD73fFD3A5EC4506638F6A0A8e22b38\">0x6C0e83422cD73fFD3A5EC4506638F6A0A8e22b38</a>, used popular daas (drainer as a service) Pink Drainer to conduct the on-chain portion of the scheme. Many users signed a malicious signature or interacted with a malicious contract, resulting in their wallets being drained of crypto assets. It’s reported that the email list used in this campaign likely came from <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/mailerlite-confirms-hack-crypto-phishing-email-3m-attacks\">the Mailerlite compromise</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when receiving emails asking them to connect their wallets and sign transactions. To prevent being scammed by impersonators, it is recommended that users check official communications from the organization. A simple search on BlockFi’s and FTX’s websites would have revealed that no official announcement allowed users to withdraw funds. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio’s MakerDao-Based Contract Exploited for $16M</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>On the weekend of March 23rd <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1771635979192774674\">Curio Ecosystem broke the news</a> that their MakerDao-based smart contracts on Ethereum were exploited. This resulted in a total loss of over $16M in crypto assets. All contracts on Polkadot and the Curio Chain itself remained secure. Curio recently posted its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1772354849029464278\">recovery strategy</a> roadmap, highlighting that 100% of funds will be restored to users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone who was a holder of Curio’s governance token was impacted. Unfortunately, this is a scenario where a user would not have been able to protect themselves from this attack, as it involved a vulnerability within Curios’ smart contracts. For those of you who are protocol developers, you can help prevent these attacks by ensuring your smart contracts are thoroughly audited.

This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://t.me/investigations/94\">22+ LastPass Hack Victims Lose 6.2M in Crypto Assets</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>@Zachxbt and @Tayvano have identified additional victims of the LastPass hack in <a href=\"https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\">December 2022</a>.

The hacker's conditions, outlined in an on-chain message, include full authority over the company's governance mechanism, KyberDAO, and ownership of all company-related documents and assets. The hacker also promised to double employees' salaries, provide a 12-month severance package, and ensure tokenholders' investments would not be worthless.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment negotiations and law enforcement investigations are still ongoing.

The bridge between HTX and Ethereum was exploited, with large amounts of ether, tether (USDT), and a wrapped version of bitcoin (HBTC) transferred to an unused Ethereum wallet. Blockchain security firms CertiK, Peckshield, and Cyvers suggest the bridge's private key was likely compromised. HTX Global's two hot wallets also lost funds. This incident follows a pattern of security issues in blockchain projects associated with board member Justin Sun, including a recent 100 million exploit at Poloniex, an exchange Sun acquired. It remains unclear if the two incidents are directly related.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Justin Sun <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1727304656622326180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1727304656622326180%7Ctwgr%5Ed12d066ab61e8fbacaa64e1f82e59196c6bc704a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&#x26;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fheco-chain-bridge-hack-86-million-lost\">reported</a>: “HTX will fully compensate for HTX’s hot wallet losses…All funds in HTX are secure and the community can rest assured.”\nProtocol operators are reminded to take wallet security and monitoring seriously.

This initiative, which includes freezing wallets previously added to the SDN List, is part of Tether's ongoing commitment to creating a secure environment for users and working closely with global regulators and law enforcement agencies. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, believes this strategy will strengthen the positive use of stablecoin technology and enhance the safety of the stablecoin ecosystem for all users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>It is recommended to familiarize yourself with the types of on-chain activities that could potentially lead to inclusion on this list.
