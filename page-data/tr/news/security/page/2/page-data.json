So this month, MetaMask unveiled Smart Transactions that can deliver a 99.5% transaction success rate, MEV protection, pre-simulation, and improved gas settings. As our Executive Product Director Gal Eldar put it:</p>\n<p><em>“At MetaMask, we believe that wallets are uniquely positioned—and in many ways responsible—for addressing these user pain points head-on. The creation of Smart Transactions serves as our commitment to take an even more active role in tackling some of these challenges and to continue innovating at new layers of the wallet experience as part of our efforts to make the process of submitting transactions not just easier and safer but also more efficient and predictable for everyone. Democratizing access to decentralized technologies is a long and winding journey, and Smart Transactions are an important and bold step toward this end.”</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/getting-started/user-guide-secret-recovery-phrase-password-and-private-keys/\"><strong>User Guide: Secret Recovery Phrase, Password, and Private Keys</strong></a></p>\n<p>In our continuous quest to educate our users, this recent support article co-authored by Oliver Renwick and Joel Willmore is aimed at teaching newcomers tips to avoid getting themselves rekt.

Check out the X Space he co-hosted with HAPI to discuss how Snaps enables innovation that makes users more secure.</p>\n<p>“One of the most important things is that security is multifaceted and what that means is that there's lots of different stages within your journey as a user in web3 ... where security products are needed. Usually, when people talk about security, they'll talk about one specific area, like 'get a hardware wallet.' A hardware wallet is great but it doesn't protect you if you sign something on a dapp that gives [a bad actor] access to your assets. You can still get drained from a hardware wallet if you interact with a malicious dapp ... At MetaMask we're focused on bringing on security providers and shipping solutions in lots of different areas.”</p>\n<p>The Snaps Directory is growing all the time! <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/\">Click here</a> to see a full list of Security Snaps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/newsletter/archive/podcast-taylor-monahan\"><strong>Taylor Monahan Explains $10M Hack and How to Stay Safe in Crypto in Interview with The Defiant</strong></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7BfHEyiQr8XefMMFkgcAbE/5ad12174182193d4a9db41492050b289/Screenshot_2024-06-06_at_2.38.01_PM.png\" alt=\"taylor monahan\"></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-media-max-width=\"560\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">original interview with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefiantNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DefiantNews</a> is here<br><br>(my opinion on root cause has evolved over time and with add&#39;l investigation but the facts have not changed)<a href=\"https://t.co/cPpcZcEitV\">https://t.co/cPpcZcEitV</a></p>&mdash; Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1788038815682334882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Meanwhile…</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1791291986324103295\">Pink Drainer Shuts Down</a></p>\n<p>Pink Drainer, a notorious crypto wallet drainer, amassed over $85 million by exploiting around 20K victims through sophisticated phishing schemes. Pink Drainer recently announced they are shutting down citing: “We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it's time for us to retire.” Despite Pink Drainer's end, the threat of similar operations looms. Pink Drainer wrote, “It is very likely that our retirement will have no major impact on the scene, people will move on to other drainers just as quickly as they moved to us.”</p>\n<p>Although Pink Drainer is retiring, there are still other popular active wallet drainers. Keeping substantial funds in hardware wallets is highly recommended, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🚨💰 According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zachxbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@zachxbt</a>, Pink Drainer is shutting down after siphoning off over $75M from around 20k victims in just a year. <a href=\"https://t.co/eg1AUjHJwl\">pic.twitter.com/eg1AUjHJwl</a></p>&mdash; Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1791291986324103295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>⚠️ Tales of Caution ⚠️</h3>\n<br /> \n<h4><a href=\"https://mp-weixin-qq-com.translate.goog/s/84lUaNSGo4lhQlpnCVUHfQ?_x_tr_sl=auto&#x26;_x_tr_tl=en&#x26;_x_tr_hl=en&#x26;_x_tr_pto=wapp\">Lazarus(APT-Q-1) Secret Stealing Operation</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Lazarus, an APT group, has been active since 2007, gaining notoriety for its 2014 Sony Pictures attack. Initially focusing on government agencies to steal intelligence, it shifted in 2014 towards targeting global financial institutions and virtual currency trading venues, engaging in the theft of money and assets. The group has employed phishing attacks through fake social accounts that offer bogus job opportunities to individuals in specific industries. Recently, security researchers uncovered a series of attacks involving ZIP files with malicious JS code targeting blockchain developers through job postings on platforms like LinkedIn, Upwork, and Braintrust. These attacks, consistent with Lazarus's \"Contagious Interview\" campaign, involve tricking candidates into running malicious code that steals crypto-related information and implants malware.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against phishing and malware attacks like those executed by groups such as Lazarus, it's crucial to verify the legitimacy of unexpected job offers through independent research and to maintain robust digital hygiene. This includes using up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security, and exercising caution with email attachments and links from unknown sources. Additionally, keeping all software updated is essential to guard against exploitable vulnerabilities. By adopting these practices, individuals can significantly bolster their defenses against sophisticated cyber threats and safeguard their sensitive information</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://x.com/etherscan/status/1788550675993174409\">Address Poisoning Attacks on the Rise, leading a recent victim to a $68M Loss</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Address poisoning is a deceptive tactic where attackers manipulate victims' transaction histories to trick them into sending funds to the wrong address. This method involves creating fake tokens, using 'vanity' addresses that closely resemble the target's, and exploiting the ERC-20 token standard's \"transferFrom()\" function. Attackers employ these strategies to conduct zero-value token transfers and spoofed token transfers, making their fraudulent addresses appear legitimate. These attacks are designed to confuse users into copying the wrong address for their transactions, leading to financial losses. The sophistication of these methods highlights the evolving nature of cyber threats in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>To protect against address poisoning, users should avoid copying addresses directly from their transaction history and instead, copy them from a trusted source.

The attackers utilized CryptoChameleon, a phishing-as-a-service kit focused on cryptocurrency accounts, capable of bypassing multi-factor authentication. The campaign involved tricking users into believing their LastPass account was accessed from a new device, leading them to a phishing site designed to capture their credentials. LastPass has taken action against this threat, which is part of a series of attacks targeting the password manager, including a significant breach disclosed last year.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Always verify the authenticity of any communication claiming to be from a service provider. If you receive a suspicious call, email, or SMS, do not respond directly. Instead, contact the service provider through their official website or customer service number to confirm the communication's legitimacy. You should also be wary of any unsolicited request to provide personal information, click on links, or download attachments, especially if they create a sense of urgency.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/286515/google-sues-two-developers-for-putting-87-fraudulent-crypto-apps-on-google-play-store\">Google Sues Two Developers for Putting 87 Fraudulent Crypto Apps on Google Play Store</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Google has initiated legal action against developers Yunfeng Sun and Hongnam Cheung for distributing 87 fraudulent cryptocurrency apps on the Google Play Store, impacting over 100,000 users, 8,700 of whom are in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, outlines how these apps lured users with the promise of cryptocurrency investments, only to trap them with fees for withdrawing supposed returns. The developers cleverly disguised these apps to mimic legitimate trading platforms, deceiving users into believing they were making genuine investments. Despite Google's efforts to remove these apps, the developers continually evaded detection by altering their identities and network infrastructure, perpetuating their fraudulent scheme on the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>The fraudulent activities of the two scammers, exploiting users' inexperience and employing \"pig butchering\" tactics to entice investments in their apps, underscore the critical importance of due diligence before engaging with any application. To safeguard against such scams, it's essential to thoroughly research and verify an app's legitimacy, including scrutinizing reviews and feedback from other users on social media. Remember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it likely is. These deceptive apps falsely promised returns on investments, highlighting the need for vigilance when investing in crypto.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-deploy-crypto-drainers-on-thousands-of-wordpress-sites/\">Hackers deploy crypto drainers on thousands of WordPress sites</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Nearly 2,000 WordPress sites have been hacked to show fake NFT and discount pop-ups, leading visitors to connect their wallets to crypto drainers that steal funds. Initially, these sites pushed crypto drainers via ads and YouTube, then shifted to brute-forcing admin passwords. Now, they display fraudulent NFT offers, tricking users into connecting wallets to malicious scripts from dynamic-linx[.]com, resulting in theft. Users should only link wallets to trusted platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Keeping substantial funds in hardware wallets is highly recommended, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets.

This resulted in a total loss of over $16M in crypto assets. All contracts on Polkadot and the Curio Chain itself remained secure. Curio recently posted its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curio_invest/status/1772354849029464278\">recovery strategy</a> roadmap, highlighting that 100% of funds will be restored to users.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Everyone who was a holder of Curio’s governance token was impacted. Unfortunately, this is a scenario where a user would not have been able to protect themselves from this attack, as it involved a vulnerability within Curios’ smart contracts. For those of you who are protocol developers, you can help prevent these attacks by ensuring your smart contracts are thoroughly audited. It's a best practice to have your smart contracts audited continuously with new releases. After completing an audit, projects should participate in a bug bounty program to incentivize researchers to find vulnerabilities in their contracts before threat actors do.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Güvenlik","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"En Yeniler","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":"MetaMask Security Monthly: March 2024","metaDescription":"Lots of exciting activity from ETHDenver and some new snaps additions are covered in this month’s installment.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"2LfySp4Gr3OBnWTfRv5034","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"MetaMask Security Monthly: February 2024","slug":"metamask-security-monthly-february-2024","subtitle":"Whether we’re in a true bull market or not, MetaMask is still working hard to protect users, and we have a few exciting announcements!

This update, now automatically enabled for users, addresses the growing concern over malicious transactions in cryptocurrency. The integration comes after phishing attacks that resulted in over $200M lost in 2023, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced security measures. With MetaMask's user base now exceeding 30 million monthly active users, this development is a significant step towards safeguarding digital assets in an increasingly volatile market.</p>\n<p>Even with advancements in user security, individuals navigating the web3 ecosystem must remain vigilant. Adding <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/18377011111579-What-are-Security-Snaps\">MetaMask security snaps</a> would offer an extra layer of protection as transaction insights can show additional details not revealed natively in MetaMask. Phishing attempts targeting private keys and secret recovery phrases are expected to rise, as Blockaid's protections do not extend to preventing social engineering tactics. Users are advised to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest methods used by attackers to safeguard their digital assets effectively.</p>\n<p>Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not install unverified software</li>\n<li>Be wary of customer support impersonators in your direct messages</li>\n<li>Be skeptical of seemingly attractive online personas; they could be scams.</li>\n<li>It is never okay to share your private key or secret recovery phrase with any website or anyone online</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/going-beyond-the-secret-recovery-phrase-in-metamask-with-account-management/\">Going Beyond The Secret Recovery Phrase In MetaMask With Account Management Snaps (Beta)</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p>The unique 12-word secret recovery phrase that every user has historically needed to create a MetaMask wallet can sometimes be difficult to keep secret and safe. There have been a variety of advancements in account management solutions over the past few years. We're happy to announce that with Account Management Snaps, there is now a permissionless path for teams that are creating these solutions to deliver to MetaMask users.</p>\n<p>In February, we introduced the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/concepts/keyring-api/\">Keyring API</a> in the MetaMask Extension, a robust tool that empowers developers to implement their account management concepts into MetaMask, and invited users to try any or all of the first three snaps in our experimental beta: <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/silencelaboratories/silent-shard-snap\">Silent Shard</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/safeheron/mpcsnap\">Safeheron</a>, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/usecapsule/account-snap\">Capsule</a>.

The incident led to about $440,000 USD stolen from users, with significant losses possibly coming from a single victim. The exploiter has begun transferring the stolen funds, leaving approximately $195,000 worth of Ethereum in their address. While the Drainer responsible for this attack has not been identified yet, many security researchers have begun labeling Pink Drainer responsible.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>Users must exercise caution when clicking on links shared on social media platforms, as even accounts perceived as trustworthy have fallen victim to hacks, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/11/691k-stolen-as-hackers-take-over-vitalik-buterins-x-account/\">resulting in significant losses of funds</a>. It is also highly recommended to keep substantial funds in hardware wallets, while wallets used for daily transactions should contain only minimal assets. Taking these steps can help safeguard against the loss of the majority, if not all, of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>\n<p>Users should be aware that account takeover attacks, such as the compromise of MicroStrategy’s official X account can occur. Pausing before clicking a link or signing a transaction could protect users from fund loss incidents. Using different accounts for different transactions based on the level of risk can also mitigate against potential damages.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://t.me/investigations/94\">22+ LastPass Hack Victims Lose 6.2M in Crypto Assets</a></h4>\n<br /> \n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>@Zachxbt and @Tayvano have identified additional victims of the LastPass hack in <a href=\"https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\">December 2022</a>. Between February 19th and 20th, over 22 victims of the LastPass hack suffered losses totaling US$6.2 million. The stolen funds were quickly transferred from EVM chains to Bitcoin.

Since the initial LastPass attack, various crypto community members, including protocol founders, investors, developers, and users who stored their seed phrases on LastPass, have experienced significant financial losses exceeding 10 million.</p>\n<p><strong>How Users Can Protect Themselves</strong></p>\n<p>If you were a LastPass user before the hack in December 2022, your digital assets may be at greater risk of theft due to compromised seed phrases or keys. We recommend transferring your balances to a new wallet. For further security, users with substantial funds should consider cold storage options such as hardware wallets, which require physical access to use their funds.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Güvenlik","slug":"security"},{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"tr","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"En Yeniler","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]}},"pageContext":{"headerId":"6I0knvqLf0DS5PB72DqUlM","footerId":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","seoId":"7k3sOZj8ICP53K0J7jXp7B","modules":["4ZjPczvQn6fYgigGRFSQPf","P9sMsqPrQxPv6xyeMWZvn"],"themeColor":null,"pathBuild":"/tr/news/security/page/2/","isFaqLayout":false,"h2FontSize":"40px","localizedPages":["/","/news/","/download/","/swaps/","/news/latest/powerful-configurable-secure-metamask-is-how-you-show-up-in-web-3/","/news/latest/metamask-portfolio-track-and-manage-your-web-3-everything/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-buy-feature-to-fund-your-wallet/","/news/latest/how-to-use-metamasks-swap-feature-to-get-what-you-want/","/news/latest/how-to-stake-crypto-and-secure-the-network/","/news/latest/bridge-easily-move-tokens-across-chains/","/news/latest/how-to-sell-crypto-for-cash/","/news/latest/dashboard-track-everything-in-one-place/","/news/institutions/","/news/security/","/news/developers/"],"limit":4,"skip":4,"categoryId":"73InEMthwQcFmYQ8Ta61gS","category":"security","totalItems":33,"currentPage":2,"totalPages":9,"sharedCopy":{"browserNotSupported":"desteklenmiyor.
