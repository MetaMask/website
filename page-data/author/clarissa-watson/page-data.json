Launched in 2016, the Fox has come a long way since then, guided by a mission to connect as many people around the world to the decentralized internet as possible. And we know connecting is just the start - much more than that MetaMask enables you to buy, sell, swap, bridge, stake, and beyond, and it all starts in Portfolio.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/?_gl=1*6m17bz*_gcl_au*NTQwNjYzOTcwLjE3MjQ3NzA0Nzc.\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> is where you get a clear, comprehensive view of your accounts and wallets across all networks. It’s also where your web3 journey begins. Whether you’ve been using MetaMask for years or even minutes, here are ten things you can do in Portfolio right now:</p>\n<h3>Ten ways MetaMask Portfolio makes you powerful in web3</h3>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Manage your digital assets and track performance in the dashboard:</strong> Easily view and manage all your digital assets including Ethereum tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all from a single, unified interface. Keep an eye on your portfolio's performance over time, with insights into asset distribution, historical transactions, and overall value trends. Remember you can view the balances of any public Ethereum address or ENS. You can also view which airdrops you’re eligible for by using the claim airdrop feature.</p>\n<p>How to use the Dashboard on MetaMask Portfolio:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWPizSkhFp4?si=vA8sLicm8Dsct7-z\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br> <br></p>\n<p><strong>2. Do your taxes:</strong> Yes, that’s correct – you can do your crypto taxes directly from Portfolio. All you have to do is connect your wallet and you’ll receive 10% off your tax services with recommended providers like CoinTracker, CoinLedger, ZenLedger, Crypto Tax Calculator, and Koinly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4aDE3uJ0OjZgg5Odon5fc0/ed0f8bb99423abb8500b724ab12d5e0b/image1.png\" alt=\" 10 Things You Can Do with MetaMask Portfolio feature image\"></p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>3. Connect to dapps and explore web3:</strong> Access and engage with all the dapps web3 has to offer directly through Portfolio: from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like <a href=\"https://aave.com/\">Aave</a>, <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\">Uniswap</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.renzoprotocol.com/\">Renzo</a>, gaming dapps such as <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">HyperPlay</a> to NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/\">OpenSea</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Swap tokens:</strong> Use the <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/swap\">built-in swap feature</a> to trade tokens directly within Portfolio, leveraging the best available rates across multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9uG6Ra-w54?si=DiRuOeEZh4tUpZnS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><br /> <br></p>\n<p><strong>5.

Eligible users can now make everyday purchases with their crypto anywhere Mastercard is accepted.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask Card pilot gives people more freedom to spend their crypto,” says Lorenzo Santos, Senior Product Manager at Consensys. “MetaMask Card represents a major step to removing the friction that has traditionally existed between the blockchain and real-world commerce. This is a paradigm shift that offers the best of both worlds.”</p>\n<p>In line with this, Chief Commercial Officer at Baanx, Simon Jones says, “We are so delighted to partner with web3’s leading wallet, MetaMask, to power the financial revolution by enabling users to be their own bank.”</p>\n<p>This pilot is available to a limited group of users in the EU and UK only. To find out if you're eligible, simply go to your <a href=\"http://portfolio.metamask.io/card\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> and check if you have a \"Card\" tab in the navigation bar on the left side. Eligible users with the Card tab will be redirected to the Crypto Life platform to set up their account and card.</p>\n<h3>Accelerating Crypto Adoption by Removing Barriers to Spending</h3>\n<p>For too long, the process of spending crypto in the real world has been cumbersome and often requires jumping through several hoops like sending funds to an exchange, transferring it to a bank, and only then being able to spend. This tedious user journey has hindered mainstream adoption of crypto as a practical, real-world currency.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Card upgrades this experience by eliminating the need for a bank to spend your crypto. This not only paves the way for increased adoption, it also aligns with the MetaMask vision of empowering people with self-custody.</p>\n<p>Most traditional crypto cards operate similarly to prepaid cards, where one must transfer funds to a third party before spending them.</p>\n<p>What makes the MetaMask Card unique is that it functions like a debit card. This means card holders can directly use the crypto in their MetaMask wallet for everyday purchases and maintain control over their funds until the exact moment of payment. MetaMask Card utilizes Mastercard's global merchant network, combined with the security of MetaMask and the efficiency of <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a> secured by the Ethereum network. This trio brings a swift, cost-effective, and secure spending experience, whether online or for in store purchases.</p>\n<h3>A Phased Launch to Global Expansion of the MetaMask Card</h3>\n<p>The pilot phase is kicking off in the EU and the UK, offering a few thousand users the chance to sign up for a MetaMask Card, which includes integration with Apple Pay or Google Pay for immediate use. Eligible currencies at launch include USDC, USDT, and WETH on Linea.</p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://portfolio.metamask.io/card\">MetaMask Portfolio</a> and check for the \"Card\" tab to see if you’re eligible. If you are, check out <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/metamask-portfolio/card/getting-started\">Getting Started with MetaMask Card</a> for easy instructions on how to set up and use your card.</p>\n<p>If you are not eligible during the pilot phase, but would like to be notified when you might be in the future, fill out <a href=\"https://consensys-software.typeform.com/to/jj3MGjae\">this form</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, MetaMask Card is set to expand its reach, with plans for geographic expansion into additional regions.

If you get a chance, ask her about the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Izzyalright/status/1598527984239054850\">tablecloth</a>, we heard it was her favorite piece of the night. 😉</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1Bla0o6EvH9sfrfBJApoml/81fc7962d6e2d005b7678250f325a01b/faith_smile.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"all smiles \"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ethereumJoseph\">Joe Lubin</a>, Co-Founder of Ethereum and CEO of ConsenSys kicked off the festivities with a toast to the creators.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4meSUkS56XLRbDJjFy7ejx/465e5cb46a2496c9c79d958a252c10a2/joe_toast.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"toast joe \"></p>\n<p>Besides spoiling the artists with a decadent dinner replete with black truffle pizzetta, sushi platters, woodfired wagyu beef tomahawk, and so much more (they were surprised each time a new course was served), drinks and entertainment were ever-flowing. We even had a designer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taramoves\">Tara Moves</a>, sketch the event in real-time:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/01615Y7gvbFGyGgJiG7EV0/6b0bb54123b7ca42665e5ecb8adfa275/tara_live_sketch.png?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"tara live sketch\"></p>\n<h3>Chatting with the artists</h3>\n<p>We could rave on about the night but you don’t have to take our word for it. We had the pleasure of interviewing some of the creators in attendance: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel</a>. It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need. I don’t need to be run by a bank. I own my keys. I love [MetaMask] security and communication.”</p>\n<p>A strong preference for self-custody is a sentiment we feel will be adopted by more people. This is the silver lining during the recent insolvency of big CeFi players: more people are asking important questions and taking a closer look at the security of their assets to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>Where does one start with their self-custody journey? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1590121718009380867\">Education</a>. Whether you’re an artist, DeFi dabbler, or tech veteran—you can download MetaMask, the wallet that gives you the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=event-recap-miami_content\">freedom to exit</a> anytime, for any reason.</p>\n<p>We closed our conversations out on a fun note, asking each artist to describe the future of NFTs in three words:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7vjwSRJmknuLCpNEQZ1Zr4/4f8fd1ef6025bfe6605c3df6f424ba33/frases.gif?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"3 words only \"></p>\n<p>MetaMask’s inaugural Artist Potluck in Miami hearkened back to ages of old when brilliant minds would come together over dinner and drinks, and talk about their art and what inspires them. Only this time, the medium was enhanced with blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all the artists who showed up and continue sharing their creations with the world. This community wouldn’t be the same without you. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Izzyalright\">Faith Love</a> for hosting and curating such an electric evening. It was an unforgettable night, and we can’t wait to do it all again.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"3dK2fJPEGLwwdB5Otiws8p","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"How to build a user feedback loop into your web3 dapp","slug":"how-to-build-a-user-feedback-loop-into-your-web-3-dapp","subtitle":"Build a user feedback form into your web3 dapp.","image":{"title":"How to build a user feedback loop into your web3 dapp image","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=384&h=216&q=80&fm=webp 384w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=768&h=432&q=80&fm=webp 768w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=1536&h=864&q=80&fm=webp 1536w","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=1536&h=864&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=384&h=216&q=80&fm=png 384w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=768&h=432&q=80&fm=png 768w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/7GikXLVJWAbwY6GC4yeNeB/35098a4562894d750b75587884193916/How_to_build_a_user_feedback_loop_into_your_web3_dapp.png?w=1536&h=864&q=80&fm=png 1536w","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"August 3, 2023","authors":[{"name":"Clarissa Watson","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"clarissa-watson"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Collecting user feedback is one of the most critical steps to achieving product-market-fit and creating a successful application. And it’s even more important in web3, where standards for UX design are still emerging and undefined.</p>\n<p>For web3 developers, the most popular method of collecting user feedback about their dapps continues to be centralized solutions offered by companies like Google and Mailchimp. However, on-chain feedback forms are now available. Let’s look at these web3-native feedback forms, why they’re important to your dapp’s success, and how to use them.</p>\n<p>In a previous <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/integrate-a-feedback-form-into-your-dapp-collect-user-data-at-scale/\">post</a>, we introduced <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/Form-XChange\">Form-xChange</a>: a new open-source, decentralized web3 form built by <a href=\"https://consensys.io/\">Consensys</a>, and showed you how to integrate it into your dapp using the MetaMask SDK.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial,  we’ll build on these steps by showing you how to deploy a feedback form to your frontend and create a new form for users to share their input about your dapp. But first, a quick reminder on the importance of collecting user feedback for product development and management.</p>\n<h2>Web3 user feedback forms to help mass adoption</h2>\n<br /> \n<p>Native, decentralized feedback forms are desperately needed in web3. Why?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>They cut costs dramatically:</strong> The only (and one-time) cost associated with creating a form is during the deployment of a smart contract. And if deployed on an L2 like <a href=\"https://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, the cost is usually not more than a few dollars.</li>\n<li><strong>They have near-infinite customization possibilities:</strong> You can design your form to collect any kind of feedback you wish (text, reactions, links, etc.). Additionally, you can customize your frontend as needed as it is completely distinct from the contract.</li>\n<li><strong>You pay only for what you use:</strong> With decentralized forms, there are no payment tiers based on the number of responses. Theoretically, you can record as many responses as you want.  \\</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you’re adopting a model where customers pay gas, you won’t incur any cost beyond contract deployment. <br>\nIf you choose to pay the bill on behalf of your customers, again the cost is a few cents when you’re operating on a cost-efficient network.\n4. <strong>You can implement token gating:</strong> Using decentralized forms, you can gate access to who can respond to your form questions. Therefore, you could theoretically limit access to wallets who own NFTs from your collection, wallets that have a certain non-zero balance of ETH, or an ERC-20 token of your choice.</p>\n<h2>A tutorial: creating your own decentralized user feedback form</h2>\n<br /> \n<h3>Step 1: Install MetaMask</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>We will be deploying and interacting with our contracts on Linea. In order to do this, we will require a crypto wallet that is configured with the Linea network and has a small balance of LineaETH.</p>\n<p>You first need a web3 wallet. In this tutorial we’ll use MetaMask — a free, easy to use wallet that comes automatically configured with Linea. You can install MetaMask <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">as an extension for your browser here</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: For this tutorial, we recommend using a browser other than Brave (for example, Edge, Chrome, Safari, etc.). At the time of writing, Form-xChange has known issues running on the Brave browser.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve added the extension, MetaMask will prompt you to complete a series of steps, including giving you your wallet recovery phrase. <em>Store this phrase carefully</em>. If lost, you can’t recover it. If stolen, someone else will have access to your funds.</p>\n<p>Once your wallet is set up, navigate to the network drop-down in the top left of the MetaMask extension and toggle <em>show test networks</em> on. From the new drop-down, select the <em>Linea Goerli</em> network. If all goes well, your wallet should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3IS7mG7vg4heLtUzP9brDe/772b05c1494f799ced5d9abefe5926f5/image2.png\" alt=\"Image 2\"></p>\n<h3>Step 2: Acquire LineaETH from a faucet</h3>\n<p>If this is your first time working with Linea, your wallet will (obviously) have a balance of 0 LineaETH.</p>\n<p>Let’s change that. <a href=\"https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea\">Infura has a faucet</a> that gives you access to free 0.5 LineaETH every day. In order to access this faucet, you may be prompted to create a free Infura account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6L9FXQnXv0WpF0ZB9LWX0X/e453b6ac40dcd15fc7ed2d60b55514cd/image1.png\" alt=\"Image 1\"></p>\n<p>Once the top up is done, you should see a small LineaETH balance:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5q16JJyRsQVUV9FSApE5AI/077cb25ea8046c040052875930247076/image3.png\" alt=\"Image 3\"></p>\n<h3>Step 3: Acquire a Linea RPC endpoint</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Sign into <a href=\"https://app.infura.io/dashboard\">Infura</a> again using the account you created in the previous step. You will automatically be redirected to the main dashboard.</p>\n<p>Here, create a new project by creating a new API key on the top right.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/38acGFUjtpXMMVpqYfvdib/9e3ccd4c9fb1f3b15b6104c965122484/image8.png\" alt=\"Image 4\"></p>\n<p>For network, choose web3 API. You can name the key anything you want.</p>\n<p>Once your key is created, you will be redirected once again to a project dashboard containing a collection of endpoints. From here, take note of the endpoint associated with Linea testnet. We will require this in a later step to deploy our Form-xChange contracts.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Install node and npm</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>The Form-xChange solution runs on a stack of Infura, Next.js, Truffle, and the Dapp API. In order to install and use these technologies, we’ll need node and npm on our local machine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm\">You can download both for your operating system here</a>.</p>\n<p>Once done, check that it has been installed correctly by checking their version numbers on your terminal.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ node -v\n$ npm -v\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Step 5: Clone the Form-xChange repository</h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Form-xChange is an open-source repository whose source code is publicly <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/Form-XChange\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s clone this repository and install all required packages using the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ git clone https://github.com/Consensys/Form-XChange\n$ cd Form-XChange\n$ npm install\n</code></pre>\n<p>Open the Form-xChange repository in your favorite code editor (e.g. VS Code). This is a turn-key project, so we won’t need to write much code apart from configuring a few environment variables.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Deploy the feedback form</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Navigate to the sub-folder containing the Truffle project and the form smart contracts:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cd packages/form-XChange\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this folder, you will see a <em>contracts</em> sub-folder that contains two main contracts: a FeedbackForm and a FeedbackFormFactory.</p>\n<p>The former implements an individual form that is capable of storing a list of questions and responses made to those questions.</p>\n<p>The latter is a <em>factory</em> contract that can be used to deploy customized versions of the former.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at the source code and make modifications according to the kind of form that you want to create. For this tutorial, we’ll stick to the default configuration.</p>\n<p>In this step, we are going to deploy the FeedbackFormFactory contract. This will allow us, the creator, to create forms from our Next frontend.</p>\n<p>In order to do this, create a file named <em>.env</em> and add the following information:</p>\n<pre><code>MNEMONIC = \"&#x3C; YOUR WALLET RECOVERY PHRASE >\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, in the <em>truffle-config.js</em> file, replace the generic RPC endpoint with the Infura endpoint you generated in Step 3. The final config file should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">require(\"dotenv\").config();\nconst mnemonic = process.env[\"MNEMONIC\"];\n\nconst HDWalletProvider = require(\"@truffle/hdwallet-provider\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  networks: {\n    development: {\n      host: \"127.0.0.1\", // Localhost\n      port: 9545,\n      network_id: \"5777\",\n      chain_id: 1337,\n    },\n    linea: {\n      provider: () =>\n        new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `&#x3C; INFURA LINEA ENDPOINT >`),\n      network_id: 59140,\n      chain_id: 59140,\n    },\n  },\n  mocha: {\n    timeout: 100000,\n  },\n  compilers: {\n    solc: {\n      version: \"0.8.13\",\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’re all set! Deploy the feedback form factory contract by running the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm run linea\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well you should see output that looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">> form-xchange@0.0.0 linea\n> npm run compile &#x26;&#x26; npm run generate-types &#x26;&#x26; npm run migrate:linea\n\n> form-xchange@0.0.0 compile\n> truffle compile\n\nCompiling your contracts...\n===========================\n> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.\n\n> form-xchange@0.0.0 generate-types\n> typechain --target=truffle-v5 'build/contracts/*.json'\n\nSuccessfully generated 5 typings!\n\n> form-xchange@0.0.0 migrate:linea\n> truffle migrate --network linea\n\nCompiling your contracts...\n===========================\n> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.\n\nStarting migrations...\n======================\n> Network name:    'linea'\n> Network id:      59140\n> Block gas limit: 61000000 (0x3a2c940)\n\n1_deploy_contracts.js\n=====================\n\n   Replacing 'FeedbackFormFactory'\n   -------------------------------\n   > transaction hash:    0x50ba2c362cb463d0b763ba5f092e3f1a8591dd9cd358f2feda035438ce02cee0\n   > Blocks: 2            Seconds: 21\n   > contract address:    0xBDAb1F857dC80968022784cc1C868820BFD2F7c5\n   > block number:        1099121\n   > block timestamp:     1688991002\n   > account:             0xc361Fc33b99F88612257ac8cC2d852A5CEe0E217\n   > balance:             0.62878173171592041\n   > gas used:            2636875 (0x283c4b)\n   > gas price:           2.500000007 gwei\n   > value sent:          0 ETH\n   > total cost:          0.006592187518458125 ETH\n\n   > Saving artifacts\n   -------------------------------------\n   > Total cost:     0.006592187518458125 ETH\n\nSummary\n=======\n> Total deployments:   1\n> Final cost:          0.006592187518458125 ETH\n</code></pre>\n<p>Take note of the contract address. We’ll need this in a later step.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Deploy the Next frontend factory</h3>\n<p>With our feedback form factory contract live, let’s shift our attention to the Next frontend. Navigate to the Next app project by running the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cd ../../apps/web\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’ll need to connect our app with the contract we deployed in the previous step. We can do so by opening the <em>lib/contract.ts/config.ts</em> file and adding the contract address.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const FEEDBACK_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = \"&#x3C; FEEDBACK FORM FACTORY CONTRACT ADDRESS >\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the apps/web folder, create another <em>.env</em> file and this time, add the Infura key associated with your project from Step 3.</p>\n<pre><code>INFURA_KEY=&#x3C; YOUR INFURA API KEY >\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’re all set! Let’s now deploy the app to localhost:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ npm run dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can now check out the app on localhost:3000. It should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/792UlrKfIZDzDJyfAKnCVC/84a1f80de120aedbd3c0a60e3a3ec811/image4.png\" alt=\"Image 5\"></p>\n<p>Let’s go ahead and create a new form!</p>\n<p>Connect your MetaMask wallet using the functionality available in the top-right corner of the app. Once this is done, the app automatically recognizes that you were the one who deployed the factory contract and hence, you are the creator of the app too.</p>\n<p>This will allow you to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/create-form\">create new forms from the UI here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6Rfg1sJDfPB3A8iwbimUuc/4c304e924d438b2e5cc999d2daad9ddf/image7.png\" alt=\"Image 6\"></p>\n<p>Add a form title, description, and at least one question, and click on Create Form.</p>\n<p>This will prompt MetaMask to approve a transaction. Remember that you’re being asked to do this because creation of a form effectively means the creation of a new FeedbackForm contract.</p>\n<p>Head back to the home page, and you should see your form there. You can now submit responses on your form!</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/4t2rVLLjK0kHQfssqU3FCc/aee3129273fbffe4f30009083e94f58d/image6.png\" alt=\"Image 7\"></p>\n<p>Note that you will be required to pay a small amount of gas in order to record this response (via MetaMask).</p>\n<h2>Keep building with the web3 stack: Infura, Linea, and MetaMask</h2>\n<p>And there you have it! Without writing almost any code, we have deployed an entire decentralized form solution for our dapp and gained the ability to not just capture user feedback, but to capture it in a decentralized, web3-native form. Projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/Form-XChange\">Form-xChange</a> will be a big step towards bringing web2 UX design to web3 applications. Feel free to modify the look and feel of your Next frontend as well as the functionality offered by the smart contracts. You are free (and in fact, encouraged) to make this your own.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false}]},"heroBg":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2DkHpHReuWGy3rlFwsseg9/f0814f115710a6ffa477c575a2215f89/News_Hero.png"}},"heroBgDark":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/RjpEbmeL6vLPeiSjePDpy/2f287d7a85aecbb7657d3bbd0b28b8ed/Auto_Layout_Vertical-dark.png"}},"bgImage":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3hGSTCAVrdhSMmLJHSHOWT/94799532e03716ceb32ad39268bef4b0/news-detail-bg.png"}},"bgImageDark":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2StKLJf0XE38EyT9GlzQuO/ed29f2ebdc6b99f7ff32175a192133c3/news-detail-dark-bg.png"}},"footer":{"contentful_id":"75bFgEllkMxpVsY8wWlroX","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulLayoutFooter"},"logo":{"contentful_id":"6fkPzzTMo3IoMKGMshuSVD","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulLogo"},"title":"MetaMask
