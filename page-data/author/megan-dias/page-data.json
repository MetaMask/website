Just as the transition from HTTP to HTTPS introduced a security standard that protected users and built trust in the internet, the web3 ecosystem needs similar protective measures tailored to our unique environment. This involves tools and protocols that alert users to potential security risks associated with certain dapps—Blockaid’s research finds that 1 in 10 dapps are malicious—ensuring that only secure and verified transactions take place.</p>\n<p>For web3 to move beyond this interesting corner of the internet and become mainstream, users need to feel confident that their assets and data are secure.

We had the pleasure of interviewing some of the creators in attendance: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel</a>. It was refreshing to hear their thoughts about art, technology, community, and the future of NFTs.</p>\n<p>They all chose to become NFT artists for a variety of reasons, including the potential for royalties and perpetual income, the ability to connect with other artists, and the desire for more control and freedom in their work.</p>\n<p>“For artists, it’s a whole new revenue stream that’s emerged. I have friends through Twitter that are artists who were previously not working full time that are now because of the NFTs,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a>, a filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist.</p>\n<p>Many of them cited the potential for NFTs to allow them to support themselves through their art and invest in other artists' creative journeys. Overall, the decision to become an NFT artist seems to be driven by a combination of financial and artistic considerations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> is a digital artist that specializes in animation and cartoon art. “To me, NFT offers a closer connection to the artist. When you collect a piece of art from Art Basel you might not have a personal connection with that artist, you might have bought it from a gallery. With NFTs, you’re able to talk directly to the artist, have a connection, and be invested in their journey and growth. You can watch them flourish in this space, which you can do with traditional art to an extent, but it’s not as easy to do on a massive scale like it is with NFTs…. Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p>While artist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>— photographer, visual artist, and self-proclaimed realistic surrealist—said, “Everything about [NFTs] is exciting. Whether it’s photographers, painters, music artists, people are taking more control over what they create and what they put out into the world. Cutting out the middleman and making it about the art again. That’s important because artists now are shining in ways they may not have.”</p>\n<p>It hit closer to home for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OrganicStonez\">Stonez</a>, a musician and digital artist who addressed the key reasons that drew him to the space: being able to protect yourself as an artist, having your family be able to reap the benefits of your art, and how the blockchain protects that.</p>\n<p>“In a traditional art world there are too many instances where an artist doesn’t get their recognition till after they die, but also their family isn’t able to reap the benefits of that because there's no trace, but on-chain—with splits and royalties—your family can [benefit] forever [from] your creations.”</p>\n<p>Besides <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask\">MetaMask</a> being their favorite wallet, it was interesting to observe how these artists shared a similar sentiment when it came to their favorite part about minting an NFT—the excitement, joy of sharing it with the world, and the ensuing butterflies once live.</p>\n<p>Their favorite part about owning an NFT was supporting other artists—friends and internet strangers alike—and they quickly declared how rewarding it is to cheer on other creators as a buyer: to invest in their growth and watch them flourish. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman\">Bryan Brinkman</a> put it, “Connecting with this community is the most fun part of this space.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3MXMkoghcknR7B5ehI717u/4fb8722473798986993e3cf05156b648/beautiful_community.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"beautiful community\"></p>\n<p>Much of the creative process involves being in the flow, or “in the zone,” a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and focused on the action of making art. When asked about his creative process, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronricketts_\">Aaron Ricketts</a>, explained it’s more about just living in the flow and reaching his nirvana in the day-to-day. Instead of forcing it, Aaron places an emphasis on observing the world.</p>\n<p>“Part of that is practicing abundance mentality and understanding things are okay even when they may not be okay. Understanding when it comes to creativity and doing things, it’s not really something you have to do. It's something that happens and naturally occurs.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllAroundArtsy\">Kira Bursky</a> felt similar when she noted, “Everything I create is very subconscious and I let it happen. I'm along for the ride. I don’t know where it’s going to take me, but it generally stems from some core feeling in my body, a sensation, and I just see what metaphor is going to play out from that visually.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2BphCE3uIO5b5WoBK66nah/f5da8f3c31876def04d55942f0529f19/table_talk.jpeg?q=55&#x26;fm=webp\" alt=\"table talk\"></p>\n<p>The group of artists was very diverse with music, canvas, digital, motion, and poetry as their respective mediums, having something to say to the world, and themselves.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ang_Ramm\">Angel’s</a> art, “It’s telling people to be happy,” stemming from her own personal struggles with mental health.</p>\n<h3>True ownership and the future of NFTs</h3>\n<p>It sometimes feels like NFT artists are overlooked when it comes to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/07/money-crypto-versus-tech-crypto/\">“tech side”</a> of crypto, but more often than not, they are deep proponents of core web3 principles like true ownership and security. Artists, more than degen traders, seem to realize the importance of self-custody.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Antpantone\">Ant Pantone</a>—an artist with both analog and digital approaches—was asked about this, he didn’t hesitate to repeat the mantra, not your keys, not your coins.</p>\n<p>“MetaMask gives me the financial independence that I need. I don’t need to be run by a bank. I own my keys. I love [MetaMask] security and communication.”</p>\n<p>A strong preference for self-custody is a sentiment we feel will be adopted by more people.

They are quick learners who adapt well through observation, play, and trial and error. As a web3 dabbler, I can find a lot in common with them.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of curiosity and learning, many teams within ConsenSys gathered together to bring <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> to life. It’s been a labor of love, and one we hope inspires the curious fox in all who come across it. We’re excited to finally share it with you today.</p>\n<h3>What is MetaMask Learn?</h3>\n<br />\n<p>MetaMask Learn is a free-to-use educational platform available in 10 languages for anyone interested in learning about web3. Through engaging lessons and interactive simulations, it helps you understand what web3 is, why it matters, and how to get started.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is for you if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve been interested in web3 but just don’t know where to start</li>\n<li>You’ve bought some crypto on an exchange but don’t know what to do with it</li>\n<li>You still don’t understand web3 principles because they’ve been too jargon-heavy</li>\n<li>You want to know what the fuss about web3 really is</li>\n<li>You just want to keep up with your friends who babble about this new digital era and its possibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list could go on. But at its core, Learn is designed for anyone who wants to take the leap to explore uncharted waters. At a self-moderated pace, you can jump into any and all lessons that interest you, interact with features in the simulation, and experience those satisfying “ah-ha” moments when you finally grasp important concepts. As you may have heard, crypto wasn’t created to make you rich, it was created to set you free. And we like to think freedom is fun.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Learn syllabus will guide you through 8 initial topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-web3?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is Web3?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-crypto-wallet?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is a Crypto Wallet?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-era-of-digital-identity?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">The Era of Digital Identity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/what-is-a-self-custody-wallet?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">What is Self-Custody?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-advent-of-digital-ownership?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">The Advent of Digital Ownership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">NFTs and Creators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/finance-decentralized?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">Finance, Decentralized</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/the-age-of-communities?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">Age of Communities</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 10 languages: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Tagalog (Philippines), Bahasa\n(Indonesia), Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish.

As the world’s leading self-custodial wallet, we’ve seen a lot and recognize the steep learning curve when it comes to learning web3 concepts for the first time.</p>\n<p>In Gemini’s 2022 Global State of Crypto <a href=\"https://www.gemini.com/gemini-2022-state-of-crypto-global.pdf\">survey</a>, respondents were nearly twice as likely to say that more educational resources would help them get started with crypto (40%), compared to recommendations from friends (22%).</p>\n<p>If you’ve been looking for a place to send your family and friends to the next time you’re sharing your enthusiasm for web3, have <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">MetaMask Learn</a> up your sleeve!</p>\n<p>In addition to helping educate more people in the space, we want to help combat scammers who prey on unsuspecting victims by equipping you with the fundamental knowledge to understand self-custody and true ownership.</p>\n<p>If you feel more confident in navigating the web3 waters after MetaMask Learn, we did our job. Pssst, never ever ever share your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) with anyone. Or click on weird links. <em>Just had to get that out there.</em></p>\n<h3>It Takes A Village</h3>\n<br />\n<p>Encompassing moments of delight throughout the experience, we want to thank our partner in this project, <a href=\"https://www.stinkstudios.com/\">Stink Studios</a> for bringing MetaMask Learn to life.</p>\n<p>The amount of successful scamming and phishing attempts reduce significantly when we equip people with knowledge.</p>\n<p>We collaborated with great organizations in the space that will all use MetaMask Learn as one of their go-to web3 onboarding guides.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/6csGV1uy43SKECcotf0TjB/13b66ddd871677c0618a180f3e1e6741/MM_Learn_Partners_Feb_2023_Final.png\" alt=\"MM Learn Partners Feb 2023 Final\"></p>\n<p>From celebrating diverse communities and encouraging inclusivity with <em>Women of Web3, Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow, Crypto Tech Women, Women in Tech, the Ukraine Government, and Giving Block</em>…</p>\n<p>To welcoming the next wave of creators, artists, and gamers in the world of NFTs with <em>Animoca, Unity, and Sandbox</em>…</p>\n<p>And overall building more awareness around self-custody with <em>ENS, Moonpay, Transak, Sardine</em>…</p>\n<p>Thank you for the work that you do.</p>\n<p>To the dapp developer, NFT creator, and DAO steward reading this, <strong>add this to your onboarding guide</strong> for a frictionless experience for your new users.</p>\n<p>MetaMask Learn is there to inspire you to learn about the new world we’re in. It’s not enough to just stay on the sidelines and only take notice when crypto exchange billionaires steal user funds, <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=mml_organic&#x26;utm_content=\">you should know exactly where to go to learn more about web3</a>.</p>\n<p>And even if you’re a self-proclaimed expert in web3, I’m sure you know someone who would benefit from this—a friend, a family member, that random person on the sidewalk passing you by proclaiming how much they don’t understand “that crypto stuff.” Maybe now they will.</p>\n<h3>Stay Curious</h3>\n<br />\n<p>We hope you enjoy MetaMask Learn as it pops its head out of its den to say hello to the world.

This feature helped protect over $100k worth of assets from being stolen.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@VitalikButerin</a>&#39;s X account got hacked, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blockaid_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Blockaid_</a> was able to detect the malicious site &gt;24h before it was uploaded to his page.<br><br>MetaMask + Blockaid are working to mitigate these situations and make web3 safer for everyone. <a href=\"https://t.co/yiRDXoRoS8\">pic.twitter.com/yiRDXoRoS8</a></p>&mdash; MetaMask 🦊🫰 (@MetaMask) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1702678994565382402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Similarly, when Uniswap founder Hayden Adam’s Twitter account got hacked, this technology was able to <a href=\"https://www.blockaid.io/post/wallet-drainers-vitalik-metamask\">detect the dapp</a> and flag it as malicious in MetaMask and Blockaid’s joint Opensea experimental feature.</p>\n<p>While we hope there won’t be a next time in terms of phishing and scams to this extent—with Blockaid estimating 1 in 10 dapps created are malicious—there will be.</p>\n<p>Unintended transaction outcomes have ranked among the most common causes of fund loss incidents within MetaMask—approving transactions that do something you didn’t intend to. Examples include transferring all your ETH to someone, selling a valuable NFT for nothing, and allowing someone to withdraw all your funds.</p>\n<p>In April 2023 we introduced an experimental opt-in Opensea alert that <strong>helped secure $500M of assets</strong> that could have been compromised. Due to the success of this experiment, we suspect that this evolved privacy-preserving security alert from MetaMask and Blockaid will help prevent billions of dollars worth of assets from being pillaged.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/106vc8sDaEmbDxrJpXiPPC/67a27974fbf5de6114950c746b92eb54/image__39_.png\" alt=\"image (39)\"></p>\n<p>We’re thrilled to share this feature directly in MetaMask to help protect our users’ assets and prevent unintended transaction outcomes.</p>\n<h3>Defense in depth: Snaps, phishing detection, triage, and education</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>With security being a top priority at MetaMask, we take a multi-pronged approach to our defense strategy. Last month saw the monumental release of MetaMask Snaps with a whole trove of community-built features designed to provide <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/latest/how-to-keep-your-metamask-account-safe-with-security-snaps/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">transaction insights</a>. These features are built by community developers to extend MetaMask’s capabilities and shield your wallet, complementing MetaMask’s underlying infrastructure and new security features.</p>\n<p>By providing you with critical information before confirming transactions, <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">Snaps</a> add extra layers of protection to your wallet instead of relying on one single functionality.</p>\n<p>In addition to Snaps, we’re working to expand the coverage of the <a href=\"https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/4428045875483--Deceptive-site-ahead-when-trying-to-connect-to-a-site?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">MetaMask Phishing Detect</a> list. This list flags malicious dapps before you even try to connect your wallet, and our team is constantly researching new types of scam activity and working with our partners to address them.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MetaMaskSupport?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">MetaMask Support</a> team is closely working with a selection of tools and other partners to help triage issues reported by users and quickly respond when someone has lost their assets.</p>\n<p>Finally, we believe education is important to avoid scams. Initiatives like MetaMask Learn help provide a free educational platform to those new or interested in web3 with short, engaging lessons like this <a href=\"https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/security-in-web3?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">Security</a> module that helps detect bad actors and reinforces the principle of never sharing your SRP with anyone. Our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/security/?utm_source=metamask&#x26;utm_medium=blog&#x26;utm_campaign=blockaid_security_alert_announcement\">monthly security reports</a> also provide comprehensive updates from our team that keep up with the evolving security landscape day in and day out.</p>\n<h3>Prioritizing innovation, privacy, and security with multiple layers</h3>\n<br > \n<p>Whether it’s privacy-preserving alerts, threat detection, or novel trust paradigms, we’re continuously working with web3 partners to examine new opportunities, angles, and approaches to security. We’re committed to providing a breadth of choice for you to shield your wallet. Protecting MetaMask users is a guiding principle and we’re excited to keep working with the entire web3 ecosystem to make this space safe while staying true to our core ethos of decentralization, privacy, and security.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the new security alert that helps you detect malicious dapps. <strong>Toggle it on in Settings under the “Experimental” tab to start validating your transactions!</strong></p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"3tE0tpmPMGsXezpOhKyWGO","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Latest","slug":"latest"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"3ZvAWcbDsRRhUJ6g1PjZjB","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Track your crypto exchange and wallet balances easily with MetaMask Portfolio ","slug":"track-your-crypto-exchange-and-wallet-balances","subtitle":"The dapp’s newest integration with Mesh allows you to pull balances from Binance and Coinbase exchange for a comprehensive view of your accounts.
