Here are five key insights drawn from his talk.</p>\n<h2>1. Ethereum was designed from day one with Account Abstraction in mind</h2>\n<p>Vitalik described Account Abstraction as a significant evolution for Ethereum, calling it “a culmination of a 10-year journey.” He noted that efforts to implement Account Abstraction actually started back in 2015 with EIP 86. He explained, “There was a plan to try to make the default wallet that users use be a smart contract wallet,” which was also one reason why logs didn’t initially cover ETH transfers between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).</p>\n<p>At its heart, Account Abstraction is all about separating the account validation logic from the execution logic. This separation enables more flexible and secure account management and paves the way for smart contract wallets that can adopt various security models, like multisig.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, users have had to juggle multiple Ethereum addresses for different purposes, which often led to confusion and security concerns. However, with Account Abstraction, individuals can manage everything through a single smart contract wallet. This simplification is particularly crucial for attracting non-technical users, as it lowers the barriers to entry and makes blockchain technology much more accessible to everyone.</p>\n<h2>2. Security and usability are critical to meet web3 users’ needs</h2>\n<p>In discussing the motivation behind ERC-4337, Vitalik also emphasized the need to balance security and usability in the Ethereum ecosystem. He highlighted three ways Ethereum is currently approaching user security, some of which include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Multisig wallets</strong>: Implementing multisig wallets is essential for enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access. By requiring multiple signatures for a transaction, these wallets provide an extra layer of protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Simple key rotation</strong>: Regularly rotating keys is a fundamental practice in mainstream computer security that helps mitigate the risk of key leakage.</li>\n<li><strong>Quantum upgrade strategy</strong>: Vitalik stressed the importance of preparing for quantum computing, noting that future quantum computers could potentially break existing cryptographic methods like ECDSA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While these security measure are great and helps form a flexible and secure account management framework that can adapt to the evolving security landscape of blockchain technology, it is increasingly important for users to navigate the blockchain easily and intuitively, ensuring that security measures do not hinder usability.</p>\n<h2>3. The Ethereum ecosystem must solve for interoperability after L2 boom</h2>\n<p>With the rise of L2 and various other blockchain ecosystems, the risk of sending transactions to the wrong chain has significantly increased. This complexity of navigating different networks can lead to costly mistakes, such as losing funds by sending them to an incompatible address.</p>\n<p>Vitalik emphasized the importance of interoperability in the Ethereum ecosystem, stating, “The whole concept of sending to the right address on the wrong chain is not something that should even be possible anymore”.</p>\n<p>Although cross-chain bridges exist to facilitate interactions between different chains, these bridges come with their own risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities that can expose users to potential losses. To tackle these challenges, Vitalik proposed implementing chain-specific addresses. This means that the address format would include both the account ID and the associated chain, ensuring that transactions become inherently safer and more user-friendly, reducing the chances of errors and improving the overall experience for users.</p>\n<h2>4. L2 teams and the web3 developer community must collaborate to scale Ethereum effectively</h2>\n<p>L2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups work by bundling multiple transactions into a single transaction. This process dramatically reduces gas fees and increases transaction throughput, allowing users to execute transactions without incurring high costs.</p>\n<p>Vitalik highlighted the critical role of L2 solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem, stating that they are designed to enhance scalability by enabling faster transactions at lower costs, which is crucial for addressing one of Ethereum's most significant challenges: network congestion.</p>\n<p>He also underscored the importance of community involvement in this process, as engaging with the community ensures that technological advancements not only meet user expectations but also foster a sense of ownership and participation in the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>5. As smart contract wallets gain popularity, dapps must rethink user authentication and permissions</h2>\n<p>Finally, Vitalik highlighted a significant shift in the way dapps will need to function in relation to smart contract wallets. Currently, many dapps operate under the assumption that ownership is directly tied to a public key associated with an Externally Owned Account (EOA). However, with the rise of smart contract wallets, users can manage multiple keys and recovery options, complicating the traditional verification process.</p>\n<p>For example, a user might employ a smart contract wallet that allows them to set different rules for transaction approvals, manage permissions for various keys, or even implement social recovery mechanisms. This flexibility introduces a need for dapps to re-evaluate how they authenticate users and manage permissions effectively.</p>\n<p>To address these changes, new standards such as ERC-1271 have emerged, designed to facilitate verification for smart contract wallets. ERC-1271 allows dapps to confirm signatures generated by smart contract wallets, ensuring that ownership and permission verification remain secure even in this new environment.</p>\n<h2>Join us at Builder Nights during DEVCON 2024</h2>\n<p>Vitalik's keynote at Builder Nights offered valuable insights into Ethereum's future, and you can catch the <a href=\"http://h_d36mel_TI\">full video on YouTube</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/all-you-need-to-know-about-builder-nights/\">Builder Nights</a> is an event series aimed at driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and strengthening community ties within the web3 and blockchain development ecosystem.

One method to collect user feedback is to integrate a  feedback or survey form into dapps. Feedback forms bridge the communication gap between users and developers and provide real-time feedback at scale to improve applications. They also foster an environment of active participation and collective decision-making.</p>\n<p>From Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) employing feedback forms for on-chain governance, to businesses leveraging them to gauge employee sentiment, the utility of feedback forms is infinite.</p>\n<p>This blog provides a step-by-step tutorial to integrate a feedback form into your application backend and start collecting user feedback. For this, we will use a feedback form we built in-house using the MetaMask SDK and other Consensys tools called, Form xChange.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/pFaNvxTSN7V4XX1EUsc6g/f0d4056dc33dcfd5f850c28bf3ce9e89/image3.png\" alt=\"image3\">\n<em><a href=\"http://form-x-change.vercel.app\">Form xChange</a></em></p>\n<p>Whether you're looking to improve your dapp’s UX, collect post-conference feedback, or a DAO member aiming to democratize decision-making, this tutorial will show you how to integrate a feedback form and open a new channel of communication within your application.</p>\n<h3>What is Form xChange and how does it work?</h3>\n<br /> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ConsenSys/Form-XChange\">Form xChange</a> is an open-sourced tool, developed for the creation and utilization of feedback forms on the blockchain. While the smart contract for Form xChange is currently deployed on <a href=\"http://linea.build/\">Linea</a>, its adaptable architecture allows for deployment on any EVM-compatible network.</p>\n<p>The platform enables participants to cast anonymous votes on the proposals incorporated within these forms and provides both participants and form creators access to view the results, reflecting the transparency ethos of web3.</p>\n<p>Form xChange utilizes a user-friendly interface built with Next.js and operates using two smart contracts, both written in Solidity: the <strong>FeedbackForm</strong> contract and the <strong>FeedbackFormFactory</strong> contract. The process is straightforward—every time a new form is created, a new FeedbackForm contract is deployed, a task handled efficiently by the FeedbackFormFactory contract.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/5sXAlyRmpNTTZvcVyx2kf6/f80225e34395661e84b225fa8d5c8fdd/image1.png\" alt=\"image1\"></p>\n<p>To utilize Form xChange, users must first connect and sign into the application using their MetaMask wallet. Some of the supported roles and responsibilities are:</p>\n<p><strong>Form Author</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to create new forms containing multiple questions for feedback collection.</li>\n<li>Ability to view an average score derived from user responses to each section post-feedback collection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Participant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to submit responses to forms or proposals while preserving anonymity.</li>\n<li>Access to view the results post-response submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Integrate a feedback form into your dapp for user feedback at scale</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>Users with less sophisticated use cases can simply rely on the already <a href=\"https://form-x-change.vercel.app/\">deployed instance</a> of Form xChange but if you have a unique use case and would like to host your own instance or control what the user interface looks like, then this part of the blog is for you.</p>\n<p>We’ll go through how to clone the repository to your local machine and get the backend running, we’ll deploy a new instance of the Form  xChange backend to Linea and finally, we’ll touch on the MetaMask SDK and how it makes it easy to connect users' MetaMask wallet clients from any platform.</p>\n<p>We’ll not be building out a user interface as it is beyond the scope of this tutorial but feel free to check out this <a href=\"https://github.com/ConsenSys/Form-XChange/tree/a63a3f482157d4d8325d1ca64852486a808086f1/apps/web\">repository</a> to get an idea of how you can approach building out your own user interface.</p>\n<h3>How to clone the Form xChange backend</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>This section assumes that you have node.js v16 or above installed on your computer, as well as the <a href=\"https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/\">Truffle development environment</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Clone the repository:\n<code>git clone git@github.com:ConsenSys/Form-XChange.git</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the contract directory:\n<code>cd Form-XChange/packages/form-XChange</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compile contract:\n<code>truffle compile</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run test:\n<code>truffle test</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to deploy your own instance of the Form xChange backend to Linea</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>What is Linea and why deploy on Linea? Well, <a href=\"https://docs.linea.build/users\">Linea</a> is a type 2 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) that replicates the Ethereum environment as a rollup, allowing developers to build on it with the experience and security of Ethereum but with lower transaction costs.</p>\n<p>Linea offers advantages like faster finality, compatibility with all development tools, default integration with MetaMask, and high throughput among other things, which makes it an excellent choice for deploying Form xChange backend.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand what Linea is and why it is a great choice, let's delve into how one can deploy to Linea. To follow through with this section, ensure you have the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/download/\">MetaMask wallet extension</a> installed as well as some Linea Eth. See <a href=\"https://docs.linea.build/users/move-funds/fund#linea-sepolia\">documentation</a> for more information on how to get some Linea Eth.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Run the Truffle dashboard: <code>truffle dashboard</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head to <code>localhost:24012</code> in your browser and connect your MetaMask wallet, then select Linea from the networks dropdown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Run <code>truffle migrate --network dashboard</code> in a separate terminal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head back to <code>localhost:24012</code> and click confirm on the prompt asking you to confirm the deployment.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it, you should see the newly deployed contract address on the terminal window you ran the <code>truffle migrate --network dashboard command</code>. You can verify successful deployment by visiting the <a href=\"https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/\">Linea block explorer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Use MetaMask SDK to seamlessly connect your dapp to users’ wallets</h3>\n<br /> \n<p>With the Form XChange backend deployed to Linea, we want to make sure that users are not faced with any difficulties when they interact with our dapps. In other words, we want to make it seamless for users to connect their wallet client to our dapp without any hassle.</p>\n<p>MetaMask presents the most effective method to connect to any dapp deployed on Linea, as the MetaMask wallet extension now includes a Linea network option by default. Furthermore, to simplify the process for developers to add MetaMask support to their dapps, MetaMask recently released the MetaMask <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">SDK</a> that can be used with JavaScript, Mobile and Gaming platforms.</p>\n<p>To use the MetaMask SDK in your React frontend code base, here are some steps you can follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the MetaMask SDK using Yarn or NPM:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>yarn add @metamask/sdk or npm install @metamask sdk</code></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Import the MetaMask SDK into your React project:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>import { MetaMaskSDK } from '@metamask/sdk';</code></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Instantiate the MetaMask SDK using these options</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code> const sdk = new MetaMaskSDK(options);\n sdk.getProvider(); \n\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Access the MetaMask SDK anywhere in your React codebase:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts', params: [] });</code></p>\n<p>Calling <code>eth_requestAccounts</code> using <code>ethereum.request()</code> prompts the installation or connection popup to appear so it is advisable to always call this function first.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">MetaMask SDK documentation</a> for more information on how you can use the MetaMask SDK with Node.js, IOS, Unity and more.</p>\n<p>Form xChange enhances your dapp by facilitating valuable feedback collection and promoting increased user input and participatory decision-making. And its ability to run on any EVM-compatible network and user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to integrate.</p>\n<p>This tutorial provides the steps  to integrate a feedback form into your  dapp. From preparing the backend and deploying it on Linea, to establishing a connection with MetaMask using the MetaMask SDK for a better user experience, you're well-prepared to foster an engaging and democratic environment within your dapp. Never forget, the potency of web3 lies within your grasp!</p>\n<p>To learn more about the MetaMask SDK, check out <a href=\"https://metamask.io/sdk/\">metamask.io/sdk/</a>.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"35qw8kZBgW901bx0VZlayB","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":"Ethereum Dapp Development: Conceptual Foundations for Web3 Beginners","slug":"ethereum-dapp-development-conceptual-foundations-for-web3-beginners","subtitle":"This blog explores how web3 changes development with decentralized networks and smart contracts, providing essential insights and tools for getting started on Ethereum.","image":{"title":"Ethereum Dapp Development: Conceptual Foundations for Web3 Beginners","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=webp 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=png 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=png 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1y1CkgvKVyIukcmYJGmmtT/7f702b93e4d2ec66030724d20f140662/Ethereum_Dapp_Development__Conceptual_Foundations_for_Web3_Beginners.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=png 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"August 29, 2024","authors":[{"name":"Chinthaka Weerakkody","createProfilePage":false,"profileUrl":"chinthaka-weerakkody"},{"name":"Kingsley Okonkwo","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"kingsley-okonkwo"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Imagine a world where online interactions are driven by a decentralized network that ensures transparency, security, and user control—this is what web3, powered by blockchain technology, promises. In this article, we'll explore the foundational concepts and tools necessary to understand development on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>To explain how the client-server architecture works in web2, people often use \"the kitchen analogy.\" In this analogy, the server is like a kitchen, and the client (user) sends a request, similar to placing a food order. The server processes this request and returns the data, akin to serving a cooked meal. The API acts as the waiter, taking your order to the kitchen and bringing back your meal, facilitating communication between the client and the server, even if they don't speak the same language.</p>\n<p>We can extend this kitchen analogy to explain web3, with some key differences such as: multiple identical kitchens (nodes) exist, one of which is chosen at random, and you must pay a cooking fee upfront before receiving your meal.</p>\n<p>Let’s use these analogies to understand what happens behind the scenes when a user interacts with a dapp. While analogies are imperfect, they can help create a mental model for starting your development journey on Ethereum.</p>\n<h2>Decentralized nodes and smart contracts - multiple kitchens</h2>\n<p>In the decentralized world, there are no traditional \"servers.\" Instead, decentralized nodes are spread across the globe, working together to achieve incredible results. These nodes collectively maintain a shared, immutable ledger called the blockchain, which ensures that every transaction is secure and transparent. Any node can process your transaction or execute your smart contract code.</p>\n<h4>What are nodes in blockchain?</h4>\n<p>A blockchain node is any computer that runs the software for a blockchain protocol and connects to its network. These nodes are the backbone of a decentralized network, serving as key stakeholders that maintain the blockchain's infrastructure. They act as storage points, so whenever a user accesses data on the blockchain, they are interacting with a node. Nodes are transparent and accessible to anyone in the network.</p>\n<p>Since blockchains operate without a central authority, control is distributed across a network of nodes, which collectively handle tasks like validating transactions and executing governance protocols. All tokens and smart contracts on a blockchain reside within nodes, making them essential to the blockchain's functionality. Without nodes, the foundational structure of blockchains would not exist.</p>\n<h4>What is a smart contract?</h4>\n<p>A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain, with the terms of the agreement directly encoded into it. When certain conditions are met, the contract automatically enforces and executes the agreed-upon terms, eliminating the need for intermediaries.</p>\n<p>However, a significant challenge in this decentralized network is ensuring that nodes act honestly and process user requests correctly, given the lack of a centralized authority. This is where the concept of “consensus” comes into play.</p>\n<p>Consensus mechanisms ensure that all transactions are verified and agreed upon by nodes, preventing fraud and double-spending, while maintaining the blockchain's integrity. To extend our kitchen analogy: after the chosen kitchen prepares your order, it shares the completed dish and recipe with other kitchens. These kitchens then follow the same recipe, compare the results, and collectively confirm that the order was prepared correctly, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the network.</p>\n<h4>Tools for smart contract lifecycle management</h4>\n<p>Unlike in web2, where you need to manage infrastructure for deploying servers, web3 shifts much of the backend logic to smart contracts on the blockchain. Below are some development environments that streamline the entire lifecycle of smart contract development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://hardhat.org/\">Hardhat</a>:</strong> A comprehensive development environment that includes components for editing, compiling, debugging, and deploying smart contracts and apps. It’s ideal if you’re proficient in JavaScript and need extensive integration with web technologies.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://book.getfoundry.sh/\">Foundry</a>:</strong> A fast, efficient option that keeps everything within the Solidity ecosystem, enhancing productivity through its speed and native support for Solidity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a detailed comparison of Hardhat and Foundry, check out our guide, <em><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/hardhat-vs-foundry-choosing-the-right-ethereum-development-tool/\">Choosing the Right Ethereum Development Tool</a></em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org\">Remix</a>:</strong> An online IDE with preloaded plugins for essential operations, perfect for quickly testing code without needing to install anything locally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developers can use various high-level programming languages to write smart contracts, which are then compiled into low-level bytecode. The two most popular languages are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://soliditylang.org/\">Solidity</a>:</strong> Known for its JavaScript-like syntax, making it accessible for many developers.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/\">Vyper</a>:</strong> Designed for enhanced security and readability, with Python-like syntax.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other languages include <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html\">Yul</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cairo-lang.org/\">Cairo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>., offering additional options depending on your development needs.</p>\n<h2>JSON-RPC API - waiters</h2>\n<p>How does your food order get from your table to the kitchen, and how does the completed order return to your table? Through waiters, of course!</p>\n<p>In web2, REST APIs serve as the 'waiters,' facilitating communication between your application and the backend server where the business logic resides. To interact with this backend, you need a URL and specific endpoints for various operations.</p>\n<p>In web3, interaction with the blockchain node happens via a JSON-RPC API. This API enables multiple dapps to interact with the same URL by specifying the contract containing the business logic within the JSON-RPC call body. Though you might be less familiar with JSON-RPC APIs, they function similarly to typical HTTP requests, as shown here:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">curl  -X POST \\\\\n  '&#x3C;https://linea-goerli.infura.io/v3/2QBbceinBF3CvQvRwe9uaHLsOe>' \\\\\n  --header 'Accept: */*' \\\\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\\\n  --data-raw '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Look closely at what’s in the data object of the request's body:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It includes the JSON-RPC version, a method for the desired action (e.g., retrieving the latest block number), optional parameters, and an ID to track the request. This format standardizes communication with Ethereum nodes, whether for data retrieval or executing blockchain actions.</p>\n<p>The URL in the request points to Infura, a node provider that spares us the complexity and resource demands of setting up and maintaining our own Ethereum node. This URL serves as a gateway to the blockchain.</p>\n<p>Remember the earlier point about paying a cooking fee upfront? In web3, executing transactions incurs a cost known as the 'Gas fee,' which depends on the complexity of the transaction and the network congestion at the time. However, reading data from the blockchain is free of charge.</p>\n<p>To ensure your transaction is correctly understood and executed, a standardized way to describe it is needed. This is where the <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/abi-spec.html\">ABI</a> (Application Binary Interface) comes in—it acts like a menu, defining how to interact with the smart contract's functions, specifying the required parameters, and how the function should be executed.</p>\n<p>So, how does your dapp communicate with deployed smart contracts? As we've discussed, this requires using the JSON-RPC API, but to simplify this process, several libraries can help. In JavaScript, options include Ethers.js or <a href=\"https://viem.sh/\">Viem</a>, and for React-based front ends, wagmi—a React Hooks library for Ethereum—is especially useful. These libraries wrap your JSON-RPC calls, making interactions with the blockchain and your deployed contracts more manageable.</p>\n<p>Viem, and by extension <a href=\"https://wagmi.sh/\">Wagmi</a> (which uses viem under the hood), provides strongly typed APIs, enhancing the developer experience with autocomplete, type inference, and static validation. By supplying an ABI, viem offers autocomplete and catches type errors before they affect users.</p>\n<p>Not sure whether to choose ethers.js or viem? <em><a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/viem-vs-ethers-js-a-detailed-comparison-for-web-3-developers/\">Check out this Detailed Comparison for Web3 Developers</a></em>.</p>\n<h2>Web3 dapp frontend development – dining</h2>\n<p>There are multiple ways to interact with smart contracts, but let's explore the most popular method: through a dapp, which is a decentralized web or mobile app designed to interact with the blockchain.</p>\n<p>So, what sets a dapp apart from a typical web app? Visually, there's often no significant difference. Developers can use familiar web frameworks from web2 in web3, like React, Next.js, or even vanilla JavaScript, and deploy dapps in much the same way. However, there are decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or SWARM that are commonly used in web3.</p>\n<p>A distinctive feature in most web3 apps is the “Connect Wallet” functionality. When you click \"Connect Wallet\" in a dapp, you're authorizing the application to interact with your wallet, allowing it to read your public address and request transactions on your behalf. Transactions need to be authenticated to verify that the user is eligible to perform the action. This is achieved through signing, a process that uses your private key—a unique identifier proving your ownership of an Ethereum account, securely stored in your wallet.</p>\n<p>Let's dive deeper into wallets: Wallets come in various forms, including browser extensions, mobile apps, and even physical devices, with MetaMask being one of the most popular. Just as real-world restaurants accept multiple payment methods, you might need to support multiple wallets in your dapp.</p>\n<p>To implement the connect wallet feature easily and support various wallet types, consider using tools like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://metamask.io/sdk/\">MetaMask SDK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://web3modal.com/\">Web3Modal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.rainbowkit.com/\">RainbowKit</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools can streamline the integration process, ensuring a seamless connection between your dapp and the user's wallet.</p>\n<h2>Ready to dive deeper into web3 development?</h2>\n<p>Web3 development changes the way apps work by using smart contracts on the blockchain, making them permanent and moving backend tasks away from centralized servers. This shift requires developers to get familiar with things like transaction signing, handling gas fees, and using JSON-RPC APIs, setting it apart from traditional web2 development. While this can be challenging, it also opens up new and exciting possibilities.</p>\n<p>To learn more about web3 development and stay updated on the latest tools and best practices, visit the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/\">MetaMask blog</a> for developer-focused insights and guides.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"Ethereum Dapp Development: Conceptual Foundations","metaDescription":"This blog explores how web3 changes development with decentralized networks and smart contracts, providing essential insights and tools for getting started.","canonicalUrl":null,"isPrivate":false},{"contentful_id":"7cXnDSyRbiIesdAeTXV2Cw","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNews"},"title":" 3 Ways the Wallet Guard Integration Makes MetaMask More Secure","slug":"3-ways-the-wallet-guard-integration-makes-metamask-more-secure","subtitle":"Learn how MetaMask enhances security by integrating Wallet Guard to protect users from scams and hacks as the web3 ecosystem grows, offering stronger security and increased user confidence.","image":{"title":"Wallet Guard blog image","description":"","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png"},"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=webp 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=webp 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=webp 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=png","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=480&h=270&q=80&fm=png 480w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=960&h=540&q=80&fm=png 960w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/1ibvmpe2BZxmFCiYcKv0Kn/7bdb2cc9cd1bb46ad51099e658bee6c5/static.png?w=1920&h=1080&q=80&fm=png 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1920,"height":1080}},"publishDate":"August 22, 2024","authors":[{"name":"Kingsley Okonkwo","createProfilePage":true,"profileUrl":"kingsley-okonkwo"},{"name":"Ryan Jones","createProfilePage":false,"profileUrl":"ryan-jones"},{"name":"Martin Peko","createProfilePage":false,"profileUrl":"martin-peko"}],"content":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>According to the 2024 Crime Report by Chainalysis, over $1.7 billion worth of crypto was stolen from users through scams in 2023 alone.

The toolkit is designed to solve significant UX problems that prevent mainstream web3 adoption &#x26; offers tools to unlock new social coordination use-cases. The Red Balloon was a social strategy game played at the EthCC conference in Brussels from July 7th to 9th, 2024. Participants experienced instant onboarding, cost-effective gas sponsorship, and multi-hop delegations for the first time in a web3 game.</p>\n<p>The goal of the challenge was to find 10 balloons scattered throughout the conference venue and win 5 ETH as the prize. However, due to the geographical and temporal distribution of the balloons, it was impossible for a single player to find all 10 balloons independently. This game was inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Network_Challenge\">DARPA Network challenge</a> and simulates a difficult large-scope problem that requires decentralized collaboration to solve.</p>\n<p>The first person to collect all 10 balloons and claim the win took home the prize money minus any commissions for people whose balloons were used for the win.</p>\n<p>This case study discusses how the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/introducing-the-delegation-toolkit-metamask-smart-contract-account-offering/\">MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</a> made each feature of the Red Balloon game possible.</p>\n<h2>Scan to play: featuring instant web3 onboarding</h2>\n<p>One of the main features of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is the ability for users to bypass the typical web3 wallet connection flow, eliminating the need to install a traditional wallet or worry about seed phrases.</p>\n<p>For Red Balloon, players onboard the game by scanning a QR code from either a physical balloon or another player who has already onboarded the game. This generates a counterfactual (free and instant) embedded smart account for them in the game web app, after which they can get straight to playing without thinking of creating or connecting a wallet, on-ramping, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/30xLTWrV2sNdQPKan4CIhd/d488393d44f93179dff3941af84136ec/image3.gif\" alt=\"Game UI GIF\"></p>\n<h2>Collect and share balloons: featuring off-chain delegations</h2>\n<p>Each balloon in the game was represented by a unique NFT smart contract assigned to a delegator account. This delegator account could issue delegations to players who discovered the corresponding physical balloon, allowing them to assign themselves as holders to claim a win. Here are the two types of delegations we implemented:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delegations from the delegator account</strong>: This allowed a player to receive a special delegation from the delegator account when they found a physical balloon. This delegation then granted the player permission to assign themselves as the balloon holder, which was required to call the win function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delegations from peers</strong>: Players could also create offers to other players, specifying the balloons they had access to and the commission they required for another player to use that balloon to claim a win. These were off-chain offers, allowing them to be free and instant.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the delegator account is entirely embedded within the game experience, playing the game did not require players to review any confirmations, making this an interruption-free experience.</p>\n<h2>Claim to win: featuring gas-sponsored batched transactions</h2>\n<p>To win the game, a player needed to be assigned all 10 balloons either by peers or directly from the delegator account before they could call the win function. The first player to achieve this condition was declared the winner and received the prize money, minus any commissions owed to other players who shared their balloon access with the winner.</p>\n<p>The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit ensured that the off-chain agreements between players were programmatically enforced. When a player accepted an offer and used the shared balloons to win the game, the commissions were automatically distributed to the respective balloon owners in an atomically batched transaction.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this was at no cost to the winner and owners of the balloons, as the game featured gas sponsorship. The only time gas costs incurred were for the batched transaction<a href=\"https://lineascan.build/tx/0x04b4f192c6404ea6660f5ea47e7171472254ca42037ce25236ab9445a098fd6a\"> (transaction hash) </a>of claim win, which included the deployment of the winner’s smart account &#x26; transfers to those who won commissions. For a game that engaged <strong>621 players</strong>, we had to pay only <strong>57 cents in gas sponsorship,</strong> which delivered a gas-free end-to-end experience for all users. This feature provides a growth strategy for developers who want a cost-effective way to sponsor gas fees for their users, ensuring a seamless experience without worrying about transaction costs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//downloads.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/C7ozKpT2JT6qQ9a7YYPVf/47ab6c89c691c6e76c688ad313345a4d/image1.gif\" alt=\"image1\"></p>\n<h2>Building better UX in web3</h2>\n<p>Through the innovative design and practical use of the Delegation Toolkit, the Red Balloon game brings a complex concept to life, allowing players to experience the potential of decentralized coordination and programmatically enforced agreements while offering a seamless onboarding and gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>This demonstration not only highlights the unique capabilities of the Delegation Toolkit but also offers EthCC participants a glimpse into the future of web3 UX.

There are too many steps a developer must consider for their users before launching a dapp or a protocol. For example, users must first download a browser extension or mobile wallet, generate a wallet address, and write down seed phrases before connecting to a dapp. Additionally, to make a simple transaction such as buying a token, users must confirm pop-ups for every interaction, figure out how to pay for gas fees, and ensure they’re signing the correct transaction. This user experience is simply not streamlined enough for the average person.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine abstracting all this friction and complexity away and enabling users to get started to use dapps with only a few clicks and no installations. This is exactly what the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit enables.</p>\n<h2>Introducing the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Today, the team is excited to announce the gated alpha launch of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit, our smart contract account offering powered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/metamask/delegation-framework\">Delegation Framework</a>. Built upon years of research within MetaMask, the Delegation Toolkit offers an innovative approach to building embedded wallet experiences directly into your dapp.</p>\n<p>The toolkit leverages the power of delegations to empower dapps and protocols to offer more user-friendly experiences in web3 through permission settings and capability sharing. The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is currently available on any EVM chain supported by a User Operation Bundler, including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Linea, Optimism, and Polygon.</p>\n<h2>Unique features of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The Delegation Toolkit stands out from existing smart wallet offerings because of our permissions-first, consent-based communication approach between dapps and wallets, enabled by the <a href=\"https://github.com/metamask/delegation-framework/\">Delegation Framework</a>. The Delegation Framework, unique to the Delegation Toolkit, is a set of comprehensively audited, open source and extensible smart contracts that collectively manage the delegation lifecycle, from delegator account creation to caveat enforcement, delegation storage, and redemption.</p>\n<p>Delegation, in this context, refers to the ability of an account owner (the delegator) to grant permission to another smart contract account or externally owned account (the delegate) to perform specific actions on the delegator's behalf. The delegator can apply rules and restrictions, also known as caveats, to delegations, describing what actions the delegate can perform and to what extent. For example, Alice delegates the ability to spend her USDC to Bob, limiting the amount of spendable USDC to 100. Bob can also redelegate permissions that have been delegated to him, creating a chain of delegations across trusted parties.</p>\n<p>This approach emphasizes permissions over confirmations, allowing users to craft customizable and modular permissions that enable dapps to streamline routine web3 operations like signing confirmations or reducing the number of dapp to wallet switches with an entirely embedded web3 experience. These permissions can also be used by dapps to carry out operations on the user’s behalf, even when the user is not connected to the dapp.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/X3XdMDJiHHDE6K3TL1hCX/03a33c66d0b7da6e1c1017baafd4e3b9/Introducing_the_Delegation_Toolkit-_MetaMask_Smart_Account_Offering_2__1_.png\" alt=\"Image red ballon\"></p>\n<h2>How the Delegation Toolkit improves common web3 activities</h2>\n<br />\n<p>MetaMask Delegation Toolkit allows developers to build seamless, elegant web3 experiences and create innovative use cases never seen before. Here are some ways it improves common day-to-day web3 activities for users and developers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Simplified onboarding process</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit allows developers to build a user flow that bypasses the typical web3 wallet connection flow, meaning no extension wallet or mobile app is required. Users will not have to worry about seed phrases or confirmation screens when they get started out in web3. Dapps can now offer flexible authentication methods such as passkeys, EOA signers, social logins, and email logins to quickly onboard users according to their security preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Unlock new web3 experiences</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit enables new capabilities previously unattainable in web3 by enabling large-scale peer-to-peer social coordination with incentive structures that do not require users to connect their accounts to your dapp. This open-sourced, modular, and backward-compatible toolkit allows you to customize and enhance your dapp for viral growth, enabling new user experiences such as recurring subscription payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal in-dapp user interruptions</strong>: The Delegation Toolkit allows developers to eliminate repetitive confirmations, pop-ups, and dapp-to-wallet switches.

In 9 months since the launch, we’ve seen 55 Snaps developed by 3rd party developers, listed in our <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/explore/\">official directory</a>, and over 900k installs across all Snaps.</p>\n<p>As we continue to find ways to make building Snaps and extending MetaMask more seamless for developers, we’ve identified 2 key areas and have shipped some important new updates, which we’ll discuss further in this blog post.</p>\n<h2>1. Reduced audit requirements for allow-listing in the Snaps directory</h2>\n<br />\nPublishing a third-party Snap just got simpler. Before now, developers needed to complete an audit before submitting any Snap to the allowlist to be included in the Snaps registry. Today, we’re relaxing this rule so that Snaps that do not do key management( [entropy API](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip32entropy)) can now be submitted to the allowlist without a security audit and distributed through our channel.  \n<p>It is important to note that we will still require third-party security audits for Snaps that do key management. Key management or entropy APIs are those APIs that are used to manage blockchain accounts on the user’s behalf. Such APIs includes <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip32entropy\">snap_getBip32Entropy</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getbip44entropy\">snap_getBip44Entropy</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/snaps-api/#snap_getentropy\">snap_getEntropy</a>. If you use these APIs and want to learn how to prepare your Snap for a third-party security audit, check out this blog on <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/5-security-audit-tips-from-msq-snap-and-consensys-diligence/\">5 Security Audit Tips from MSQ Snap and Consensys Diligence</a>.</p>\n<p>As of today, allow-listing is still a manual process. We check if a Snap needs an audit when submitted for the allowlist, and if not, we will proceed with submitting it to the registry. All Snaps require two approvals from the Snaps team before they can be allowed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a subset of third-party Snaps can now be installed by anyone without inclusion on our allowlist permissionlessly. Snaps that rely only on “open” permissions from the following list do not need to be allow-listed before they can be installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>endowment:cronjob</li>\n<li>endowment:ethereum-provider</li>\n<li>endowment:lifecycle-hooks</li>\n<li>endowment:page-home</li>\n<li>endowment:signature-insight</li>\n<li>endowment:transaction-insight</li>\n<li>snap_dialog</li>\n<li>snap_getLocale</li>\n<li>snap_manageState</li>\n<li>Snap_notify</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We still encourage developers to get third-party security audits for their Snaps even if not required for allowlisting. Also, allow-listing is still required for Snaps to appear in the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io\">Snaps Directory</a>.</p>\n<h2>2. Seamless auto-connection for selected dapps</h2>\n<br />\nDevelopers can now specify a list of dapps with auto-connection privileges with their Snap. This means that for specific dapps, when the dapp calls `wallet_requestSnaps`, users would no longer need to confirm a connection manually, and the dapp can check if the Snap is installed seamlessly. This is especially useful for Snaps that are used by multiple dapps as it allows for the following UX flow:\n<ul>\n<li>You build a Snap for use by one or more dapps and authorize an automatic connection to your Snap's companion dapp by listing it in the <code>initialConnections</code> configuration option.</li>\n<li>A user installs your Snap while interacting with a dapp that uses it.</li>\n<li>The user lands on your Snap's companion dapp.</li>\n<li>Your companion dapp can immediately identify that the Snap has already been installed.</li>\n<li>The user can interact with the companion dapp without connecting to the Snap manually.</li>\n<li>This can be extended to your trusted known dapps of choice that integrates your Snap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Consensys/linea-voyager-snap\">Linea Voyager Snap</a> currently uses this feature, and you can see the seamless connection by installing the Linea Voyager Snap from the <a href=\"https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/consensys/linea-voyager/\">Snaps Directory</a> and visiting the <a href=\"https://voyager-snap.linea.build/\">Linea Voyager companion dapp</a>. Unlike most companion dapps, this one automatically connects to the Snap, even though you did not install it or connect it manually from the dapp. See the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/how-to/allow-automatic-connections/\">Snaps documentation</a> for detailed information on how to use this feature.</p>\n<h2>Keep building with MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<br />\nAs we continue to build the permissionless future for web3 wallets, we’re constantly working on improving the experience, and these two new updates are some of what we have in the pipeline. \n<p>If you’re currently building with Snaps, we’d like to know what you think, so <a href=\"https://survey.usabilla.com/live/s/64f99fe2b12d6940df7c0357?utm_source=ownedmedia&#x26;utm_medium=landing-page&#x26;utm_campaign=2023_Sep_snaps-launch_awareness_content\">leave us feedback </a>as it helps us build a better wallet for tomorrow.

Unlike in the early days of Ethereum, when one could run a node on any computer, technical requirements have changed and running a node to support your  dapp requires a lot of resources.</p>\n<p>Node providers like Infura solve this problem by running and managing blockchain nodes while providing end-users access over an API endpoint, often utilizing blockchain RPC technology. RPC providers act as a bridge between dapps and the blockchain, allowing developers to interact with the blockchain without the need to run a node themselves. Most of the industry players, including prominent ones, trust and leverage the services of node providers to power their applications.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the key factors to consider when choosing an RPC provider for your web3 dapp.</p>\n<h2>Key factors to consider</h2>\n<br />\n<p><strong>1. Reliability and uptime</strong></p>\n<p>A provider with high reliability and uptime ensures that your application is available and functional for users at all times, helping you provide the best user experience possible. A commonly used benchmark for measuring uptime is the percentage of time that a system is operational, often measured using the number of nines (9s) from 99% — 99.9999%. <a href=\"https://www.infura.io/platform/infrastructure\">Infura</a> meets this requirement by supporting top blockchain projects with 99.9% reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Scalability</strong></p>\n<p>The ability to handle high volumes of traffic and deliver swift response times is important in the growth of your dapp. You want to consider a provider that can ensure optimal performance and user experience regardless of where your users are based. Infura’s Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN) ensures scalability through it’s various partners located all over the world. More on that <a href=\"https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Security</strong></p>\n<p>The importance of security and privacy measures cannot be overstated, as these directly impact the safety and protection of sensitive data and users’ trust in your application. Infura uses private API keys to grant developers greater control over the security of their dapps. With unique identifiers associated with a specific user or application, these keys can be used to authenticate or restrict API requests from specific users or applications. Additionally, to ensure the security of the DIN network, Infura screens partners to ensure they meet the expected standards of service for privacy and security.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Cost</strong></p>\n<p>The cost of using an RPC provider can vary significantly. Compare the pricing models of different providers and select one that offers the best value for your budget and requirements. Also consider the amount of usage your applications will require and whether the pricing structure is scalable to accommodate future growth. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.infura.io/pricing\">Infura's pricing page</a> for more information on how Infura is priced.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Chain compatibility</strong></p>\n<p>A provider that supports multiple blockchain networks can greatly improve your developer experience by ensuring the seamless integration of dapps across different chains and ecosystems. Through DIN, Infura is able to support a wide range of networks and their testnets, ensuring reduced complexity with managing multiple blockchain integrations.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Support and documentation</strong></p>\n<p>As you scale up your project, you may start to face challenges that require a high level of expertise and experience to overcome. This is where support will be invaluable in navigating complexities and ensuring your project’s success. The availability and quality of developer resources and documentation also play a part in enhancing your development experience and speeding up the time it takes to integrate with your application.</p>\n<h2>Next steps for web3 developers</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Choosing the right Ethereum API RPC provider is a crucial decision that can greatly influence the success of your project.

We will walk through setting up your development environment, writing the token contract, and deploying it on the Linea layer 2 network.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Set up your development environment with Hardhat</h2>\n<br />\nBefore you start developing your Ethereum token, you'll need to set up your development environment. In this blog, we will be using Hardhat. Follow the steps below:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Install Node.js and npm</strong>: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, and npm is its package manager. Download and install them from the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">official Node.js website</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create a new Hardhat project</strong>: Open your terminal, create a new directory for your project, and navigate into it. Then, run:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\nmkdir my-token\n\ncd my-token\n\nnpm init -y\n\nnpm install --save-dev hardhat\n\nnpx hardhat\n\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Install necessary Hardhat plugins and OpenZeppelin contracts</strong>:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\nnpm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts\n\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 2: Create your Ethereum token</h2>\n<br />\nFollow these steps to create a simple ERC-20 token:\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a token contract</strong>: In your Hardhat project, navigate to the contracts directory and create a new file named MyToken.sol. Open this file and define your token contract:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-solidity\">\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\n\ncontract MyToken is ERC20 {\n\n    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\") {\n\n        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This smart contract creates an ERC-20 token named \"MyToken\" with the symbol \"MTK\" using OpenZeppelin's library. When deployed, it mints an initial supply of tokens specified by the deployer and assigns them to the deployer's address.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Write a deployment script</strong>: In the scripts directory, create a new file named deploy.js and add the following code to deploy your contract:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nasync function main() {\n\n  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();\n\n  console.log(\"Deploying contracts with the account:\", deployer.address);\n\n  const MyToken = await ethers.getContractFactory(\"MyToken\");\n\n  const myToken = await MyToken.deploy(1000000);\n\n  console.log(\"MyToken deployed to:\", myToken.address);\n\n}\n\nmain()\n\n  .then(() => process.exit(0))\n\n  .catch((error) => {\n\n    console.error(error);\n\n    process.exit(1);\n\n  });\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above script deploys the \"MyToken\" smart contract using Hardhat and ethers.js, initializing it with a supply of 1,000,000 tokens. It retrieves the deployer's address and deploys the contract.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Compile and deploy your contract locally</strong>: In your terminal, compile and deploy your contract to a local blockchain provided by Hardhat:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\nnpx hardhat compile\n\nnpx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost\n\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 3: Deploy your token contract to Linea testnet</h2>\n<br />\nNow that we have developed and deployed our ERC-20 token locally, it's time to deploy it to the Linea testnet using Infura and MetaMask. Follow these steps to get your token live on the Linea testnet.\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set up an Infura account</strong>: Infura provides easy access to the various blockchain networks and their testnets. Create a new project, select Linea Sepolia testnet from the menu of supported networks, and copy out the project ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configure MetaMask</strong>: Open your MetaMask wallet and navigate to the network section. In the dropdown menu, ensure that “show test networks” is toggled on. Then select Linea Sepolia testnet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get Linea Sepolia ETH</strong>: When deploying your contract, you need Linea Sepolia ETH to pay for gas fees. You can get some Linea ETH by visiting the <a href=\"https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea\">official Linea Sepolia faucet</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Update Hardhat configuration</strong>: In your Hardhat project, update your hardhat.config.js to include the Linea testnet configuration:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nrequire(\"@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers\");\n\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config();\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  solidity: \"0.8.0\",\n\n  networks: {\n\n    lineaTestnet: {\n\n      url: `https://linea-sepolia.infura.io/v3/${process.env.INFURA_PROJECT_ID}`,\n\n      accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`],\n\n      chainId: 59141\n\n    }\n\n  }\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ensure your .env file contains the necessary environment variables:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\nINFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id\n\nPRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Deploy your contract to Linea Sepolia testnet</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, to deploy your token contract to the Linea testnet, run this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\nnpx hardhat compile\n\nnpx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network lineaTestnet\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>This script will deploy your ERC-20 token contract to the Linea testnet using the account connected to MetaMask.</p>\n<h2>Advance your web3 dapp development with MetaMask Developer</h2>\n<br />\nBy mastering the basics of Ethereum token development, setting up your development environment, and adhering to best practices, you can successfully develop and deploy your own Ethereum token.

In short, Connext simplifies cross-chain transactions and enhances accessibility to make blockchain technology more approachable for the average user. At the core of <a href=\"https://www.connext.network/\">Connext</a> are two important protocols.</p>\n<p>The first is the underlying messaging layer that reads the state from multiple rollups while bridging and batching them into one combined statement, similar to how rollup sequencers work. This ensures that any information available to any chain is available to other chains.</p>\n<p>The second component is the intent protocol, which allows a Connext user without funds on chain A to complete a transaction using external liquidity from third-party market actors (solvers) on that chain. This way, the Connext user does not need to consider the overhead of bridging their tokens from chain B to chain A but can express intent, and a solver will step in on their behalf to fund the transaction immediately and get repaid by the protocol later.</p>\n<h2>The challenge of bridging tokens across multiple chains in web3</h2>\n<br />\n<p>ERC-20 tokens were never designed to be bridged. Instead, they were intended to reside on a single chain, which is why they don’t have inherent mint or burn functions. When an ERC-20 token is bridged today, behind the scenes, the token is locked into a bridge while the bridge mints an attestation of the locked token on another chain. This means that if the bridge gets hacked and funds are drained, the value of the ERC-20 token will no longer be backed, causing the attestation to lose its value.</p>\n<p>Another challenge involves bridging project-specific ERC-20 tokens, which has been historically challenging due to low adoption and immense liquidity requirements. Users can use a canonical bridge to make tokens interoperable or available across different chains, however, this requires that other bridges acquire the native token of the canonical bridge to interact with r tokens.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, using a third-party bridge would limit users to a single ecosystem and base a project's security entirely on that bridge. All these solutions are not ideal and place limitations on projects.</p>\n<h2>xERC-20 token standard and how it enables interoperability</h2>\n<br />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.xerc20.com/\">xERC-20</a> is a standard that solves this problem by providing optionality; instead of locking ERC-20 tokens into a bridge, you lock them into a 'lockbox', which is essentially a wrapper contract. This wrapper contract then mints an xERC-20 token with both a burn and mint function, allowing bridges to manage these actions efficiently. Because these ERC-20 tokens on L1 are locked into a lockbox, on L2, you can have a consistent representation, meaning that irrespective of the L2 you’re using, you will end up with the same token.</p>\n<p>This solution isn’t novel, as it has been technically feasible for some time. However, the issue with this solution lies in the security risks it introduces, where multiple bridges control the minting of your token, exposing it to security issues should one of the bridges get hacked. xERC-20 addresses this security issue by introducing minting limits, where an issuer can assign adjustable limits to the number of tokens a bridge can mint.</p>\n<h2>Get started building in web3 with MetaMask Developer</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Are you a web3 developer building consumer dapps?</p>\n<p>MetaMask Developer suite, comprising the MetaMask Wallet API, SDK, web3 service APIs, and Snaps, offers a comprehensive set of tools for onboarding millions of the web’s most engaged users.

Before that, the common practice was for wallets to expose an EIP-1193 provider via the <code>window.ethereum</code> global object in web browsers. This technique worked well in the early days when users typically owned and connected to one wallet.</p>\n<p>As the ecosystem grew and users started utilizing multiple wallets at a time, it became difficult for dapp developers to properly manage the process of detecting what wallet a user was connected to or give users the option of selecting which wallet to use when many were installed.</p>\n<p>In October 2023, this standard, now known as <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963\">EIP-6963 or Multi-Wallet Injected Provider Discovery</a>, was accepted. Since then, wallet developers have started introducing EIP-6963 as the default way of discovering wallet providers. <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/improving-the-multi-wallet-user-experience-with-eip-6963/\">MetaMask is no exception</a>, as we’ve ensured that this standard is supported by the MetaMask wallet API and MetaMask SDK.</p>\n<p>Additionally, dapps that rely on <code>window.ethereum</code> are assured continued support. However, we encourage implementing EIP-6963 support into all dapps as the preferred provider discovery mechanism. The easiest way to do this is by integrating with third-party libraries supporting EIP-6963. Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/detect-wallet/multiple-wallets/#use-third-party-libraries\">MetaMask documentation</a> for a growing list of available libraries.</p>\n<p>This tutorial will walk you through the basic steps to implementing EIP-6963 support in your dapp if you decide not to use the available third-party libraries. It uses React and TypeScript however, any JavaScript developer should be able to follow through and implement this in their framework of choice.</p>\n<h2>Define the Supported Interfaces and Types for Web3 Wallets</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The first step to supporting multi-wallet discovery in your dapp is to define all the supported interfaces and types as outlined in the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963\">improvement proposal</a>. These interfaces and types provide a structured and standardized way to handle Ethereum wallet providers, facilitating the integration and discovery of multiple Ethereum wallets.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// EthereumProviderTypes.d.ts\n\n// Interface for provider information following EIP-6963.\ninterface EIP6963ProviderInfo {\n  walletId: string; // Unique identifier for the wallet e.g io.metamask, io.metamask.flask \n  uuid: string; // Globally unique ID to differentiate between provider sessions for the lifetime of the page\n  name: string; // Human-readable name of the wallet\n  icon: string; // URL to the wallet's icon\n}\n\n// Interface for Ethereum providers based on the EIP-1193 standard.\ninterface EIP1193Provider {\n  isStatus?: boolean; // Optional: Indicates the status of the provider\n  host?: string; // Optional: Host URL of the Ethereum node\n  path?: string; // Optional: Path to a specific endpoint or service on the host\n  sendAsync?: (request: { method: string, params?: Array&#x3C;unknown> }, callback: (error: Error | null, response: unknown) => void) => void; // For sending asynchronous requests\n  send?: (request: { method: string, params?: Array&#x3C;unknown> }, callback: (error: Error | null, response: unknown) => void) => void; // For sending synchronous requests\n  request: (request: { method: string, params?: Array&#x3C;unknown> }) => Promise&#x3C;unknown>; // Standard method for sending requests per EIP-1193\n}\n\n// Interface detailing the structure of provider information and its Ethereum provider.\ninterface EIP6963ProviderDetail {\n  info: EIP6963ProviderInfo; // The provider's info\n  provider: EIP1193Provider; // The EIP-1193 compatible provider\n}\n\n// Type representing the event structure for announcing a provider based on EIP-6963.\ntype EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent = {\n  detail: {\n    info: EIP6963ProviderInfo; // The provider's info\n    provider: EIP1193Provider; // The EIP-1193 compatible provider\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I’ve added comments to help you understand what each interface and type represents. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963\">improvement proposal</a> for a more detailed explanation.</p>\n<h2>Subscribe to Events and Get Notified of New Connections</h2>\n<br />\n<p>The next step is to establish a way to alert your dapp when new wallet connections are detected. Remember, the purpose of EIP-6963 is to enable seamless connection and switching between multiple wallets. In React, we can achieve this with the sample code below.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// store.tsx\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface WindowEventMap {\n    \"eip6963:announceProvider\": CustomEvent&#x3C;EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent>;\n  }\n}\n\nlet providers: EIP6963ProviderDetail[] = [];\n\nexport const store = {\n  value: () => providers,\n\n  subscribe: (callback: () => void) => {\n    function onAnnouncement(event: EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent) {\n      // Prevent adding a provider if it already exists in the list based on its uuid.\n      if (providers.some(p => p.info.uuid === event.detail.info.uuid)) return;\n\n      // Add the new provider to the list and call the provided callback function.\n      providers = [...providers, event.detail];\n      callback();\n    }\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"eip6963:announceProvider\", onAnnouncement as EventListener);\n    window.dispatchEvent(new Event(\"eip6963:requestProvider\"));\n\n    return () => window.removeEventListener(\"eip6963:announceProvider\", onAnnouncement as EventListener);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of the above code sample:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We extend the <code>WindowEventMap</code> with a custom event named \"eip6963:announceProvider,\" thereby establishing a global event type for announcing the availability of new Ethereum wallet providers.</li>\n<li>We initialize an external store, represented by an array of named providers, which is used to keep track of all detected wallet providers. This array stores objects conforming to the <code>EIP6963ProviderDetail</code> interface, which includes information about the wallet provider and its corresponding Ethereum provider.</li>\n<li>We introduce a subscription mechanism through the <code>subscribe</code> function within the store object. This function listens for the \"eip6963:announceProvider\" event and updates the external store with the details of any newly announced providers. It ensures that providers are only added if not in the store, avoiding duplicate entries.</li>\n<li>The store object provides two key functionalities:\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>value</code> function allows for retrieving the current state of the external store, i.e., the list of detected wallet providers.</li>\n<li>The <code>subscribe</code> function enables components or other parts of the application to subscribe to changes in the store. When a new provider is announced and added to the store, subscribed entities are notified via a callback mechanism, allowing them to react to the updated list of providers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, let’s define a <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> hook to synchronize the local state with the external store defined in store.tsx above:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// useSyncProviders.tsx\n\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from \"react\";\nimport { store } from \"./store\";\n\nexport const useSyncProviders = ()=> useSyncExternalStore(store.subscribe, store.value, store.value)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Dynamically Display Buttons for each Detected Web3 Wallet Provider</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Let’s define a React component that uses the <code>useSyncProviders</code> hook to render a button for each detected wallet provider dynamically:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useState } from 'react';\nimport { useSyncProviders } from '../hooks/useSyncProviders';\nimport { formatAddress } from '~/utils';\n\nexport const DiscoverWalletProviders = () => {\n  const [selectedWallet, setSelectedWallet] = useState&#x3C;EIP6963ProviderDetail | undefined>();\n  const [userAccount, setUserAccount] = useState&#x3C;string>('');\n  const providers = useSyncProviders();\n\n  const handleConnect = async (providerWithInfo: EIP6963ProviderDetail) => {\n    const accounts = await providerWithInfo.provider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' }).catch(console.error);\n\n    if (accounts &#x26;&#x26; accounts[0]) {\n      setSelectedWallet(providerWithInfo);\n      setUserAccount(accounts[0]);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &#x3C;>\n      &#x3C;h2>Wallets Detected:&#x3C;/h2>\n      &#x3C;div>\n        {providers.length > 0 ? (\n          providers.map((provider) => (\n            &#x3C;button key={provider.info.uuid} onClick={() => handleConnect(provider)}>\n              &#x3C;img src={provider.info.icon} alt={provider.info.name} />\n              &#x3C;div>{provider.info.name}&#x3C;/div>\n            &#x3C;/button>\n          ))\n        ) : (\n          &#x3C;div>There are no announced providers.&#x3C;/div>\n        )}\n      &#x3C;/div>\n      &#x3C;hr />\n      &#x3C;h2>{userAccount ? 'Wallet Selected' : 'No Wallet Selected'}&#x3C;/h2>\n      {userAccount &#x26;&#x26; (\n        &#x3C;div>\n          &#x3C;img src={selectedWallet!.info.icon} alt={selectedWallet!.info.name} />\n          &#x3C;div>{selectedWallet!.info.name}&#x3C;/div>\n          &#x3C;div>({formatAddress(userAccount)})&#x3C;/div>\n        &#x3C;/div>\n      )}\n    &#x3C;/>\n  );\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of the above React component:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use two state hooks, <code>selectedWallet,</code> and <code>userAccount</code>, to keep track of the currently selected Ethereum wallet provider and the user's account address, respectively.</li>\n<li>We use the <code>useSyncProviders</code> hook to detect each available Ethereum wallet provider dynamically. This hook returns an array of providers, each conforming to the EIP6963ProviderDetail interface that includes the provider's information and Ethereum provider object.</li>\n<li>We define the <code>handleConnect</code> function that is invoked when a wallet provider button is clicked. This function uses the provider's <code>request</code> method with the <code>eth_requestAccounts</code> method to prompt the user for account access. If access is granted, the first account address is stored in <code>userAccount</code>, and the provider's details are stored in <code>selectedWallet</code>.</li>\n<li>Finally, we render a list of buttons for each detected wallet provider, displaying the provider's name and icon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With our component defined, the last step is to render this component.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import './App.css'\nimport { DiscoverWalletProviders } from './components/DiscoverWalletProviders'\n\nfunction App() {\n\n  return (\n    &#x3C;>\n      &#x3C;DiscoverWalletProviders/>\n    &#x3C;/>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these few steps, we’ve successfully implemented EIP-6963 support in our dapp on a fundamental level. See below for a visual representation of the functionality we just built.

Their mission is to enhance the web3 gaming user experience by integrating interoperability of digital assets, on-chain reputation, and seamless wallet integration into web3 gaming. Currently, HyperPlay has a collection of 67 games in their store, featuring titles from renowned gaming studios such as Square Enix, Animoca, and others. HyperPlay’s store also includes the entire games library from Epic Games and GOG.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hyperplay.xyz/\">platform</a> is cross-chain and supports games built on Ethereum and every EVM chain, Cosmos, Solana, Starkware, and Sui, with plans to expand support to additional blockchains. Additionally, HyperPlay is cross-platform compatible, offering support for operating systems including Windows, Steam Deck, MacOS, and Linux. Native Windows games can also be launched on MacOS, Linux, or SteamDeck using HyperPlay’s integration of gaming compatibility libraries.</p>\n<p>This case study explores how the MetaMask Developer suite empowers HyperPlay to achieve its mission of bringing immersive gaming experience to web3 players.</p>\n<h2>The challenge: Enable seamless web3 wallet support for game developers and immersive gameplay for users</h2>\n<p>To meet their objective of immersive gameplay and interoperability in web3 gaming, HyperPlay recognizes the necessity for players to use the same wallets across different games and not be forced to create a new wallet for each game that they play. Moreover, to streamline new player onboarding, wallets must be configured so that players aren't forced to exit the game to a separate website to access the web3 aspects of the game.</p>\n<p>A common approach in the current web3 gaming landscape to address this issue involves the use of embedded proprietary wallets. Here, game developers are tasked with creating their own single-game siloed wallets to provide a seamless in-game experience. However, this poses a significant challenge for developers and players, as these wallets increase the friction for playing the game for players who already have a wallet, and they also undermine the interoperability between games because it is difficult to use the assets in these wallets outside of the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/2fbSb1kAPlSO8YisT3HxvW/abe9c2b3bc9cc65a1131a21c8c65a172/image__1_.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay image 1\"></p>\n<p>Furthermore, game developers prefer to spend time designing games rather than developing custom wallets and infrastructure with multiple SDK and wallet integrations to ensure cross-chain support for their games.</p>\n<h2>The solution: Improved UX and interoperability with the MetaMask Wallet API and SDK</h2>\n<p>By integrating with the MetaMask Wallet API and SDK, HyperPlay is building a seamless onboarding experience for players. When players encounter their first on-chain transaction without a wallet, they will be able to sign up and onboard a MetaMask wallet in-game. An overlay is displayed on top of the game, and the MetaMask onboarding flow is streamed to the user using graphical libraries like OpenGL, DirectX, or Vulkan. User interactions are streamed back, leading to calls to the HyperPlay wallet API, which are then directed to the MetaMask Wallet API.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3ZIJiLFgbzZDArIxOxTIVi/e3ff6920c115a28667120fb4285ad161/image__1_.png\" alt=\"HyperPlay image 2\"></p>\n<p>Developers don’t need to embed an SDK or include any sort of code or package inside their game either. All they need to do is call the HyperPlay API, which then routes these calls to the MetaMask Wallet API, serving as a communication library for MetaMask.</p>\n<p>HyperPlay was also able to leverage MetaMask Wallet API for authentication and sign-in processes, facilitating transactions in games’ marketplaces for buying and selling gaming items, and offering game developers access to a vast user base with significant liquidity—all without the burden of game developers having to manage the wallet integration on their own.</p>\n<h2>Building new onboarding experiences for web3 users with MetaMask Snaps</h2>\n<p>HyperPlay recently introduced <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">Snaps</a> to their game store, with the next step focused on Snaps adoption by game developers. The Snaps integration aims to further enhance the user and developer experience on HyperPlay as the games can prompt users to use specific Snaps beneficial to their gameplay.</p>\n<p>The first use of Snaps on HyperPlay involves non-EVM Snaps that enable players to interact with games on non-EVM blockchains through MetaMask. This feature helps developers of games on non-EVM blockchains to access MetaMask’s vast user base of web3 natives and the liquidity in their wallets. It is also beneficial for players who want to play games available on non-EVM chains but lack knowledge of those blockchains. If the player does not have the required Snap installed, the game can prompt the Snap installation and allow the player to continue the game.</p>\n<p>Another area HyperPlay is investigating is Account Abstraction and Contract Account Allowances. This focus is especially relevant for games generating a high volume of transaction requests daily. Implementing Contract Account Allowances can be beneficial as conducting numerous transactions in-game can negatively impact user experience and security.</p>\n<p>An Account Abstraction Snap can offer a solution by allowing players to deposit a specific amount into a contract account, this account can then use session keys to grant and revoke auto-spendable allowances to particular games, up to a user-defined threshold.</p>\n<h2>Get started with MetaMask Developer today</h2>\n<p>Are you a developer building consumer dapps?</p>\n<p>MetaMask Developer suite, comprising the MetaMask Wallet API, SDK, Web3 service APIs, and Snaps, offers a comprehensive set of tools for onboarding millions of the web’s most engaged users.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">developer portal</a> to learn more about our offerings.</p>"}},"categories":[{"contentful_id":"Jc9ZQ937JgPbuV2Xap2l7","node_locale":"en-US","internal":{"type":"ContentfulNewsCategory"},"name":"Developers","slug":"developers"}],"metaTitle":"How MetaMask Developer Suite Powers HyperPlay's Game Store","metaDescription":"Learn how the MetaMask Developer suite was used to build HyperPlay’s web3 game store.

Today, smart contracts can only access public off-chain, real-time, and historical on-chain data. However, the value and importance of users' personal data, such as social security numbers, bank statements, personal identification documents, etc., have been proven in the Internet economy. Yet, these types of private off-chain data are not readily available to smart contracts due to the risks associated with putting them on the public blockchain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://padolabs.org/\">PADO</a> has built the infrastructure and tools that will allow users to securely import their private off-chain data from any internet data source into web3, using Multiparty Computation—Transport Layer Security (MPC-TLS).</p>\n<p>PADO also enables users to safely use this data on third-party dapps in a trustless manner, while providing dapps with the tools to verify the authenticity and validity of users' data without revealing sensitive information or raw details to these dapps. PADO achieves this by employing modern cryptographic technologies like Interactive Zero-Knowledge (IZK) Proofs and Zero-Knowledge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (zkFHE).</p>\n<p>In this blog, we will explore how MetaMask Developer is helping PADO Labs get to market and scale quickly through the <a href=\"https://consensys.io/fellowship\">Consensys Fellowship</a>, a <a href=\"https://linea.mirror.xyz/gNleczm8540Zf_J_jyKymCvPGRdsYn9bJZke6UYU960\">partnership with Linea</a>, and the use of our <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">developer tools</a>.</p>\n<h2>How PADO is building a ZK attestation protocol for web3</h2>\n<p>The first step for PADO to successfully onboard users and enable them to own and securely manage their private data in this new system is to assign them an Ethereum account. Since many of these users will be non-web3 natives, PADO needs to emphasize security at all stages of the user onboarding process. According to PADO, the best approach would be to completely own and manage the onboarding and authentication process to better uphold the desired level of security.</p>\n<p>However, considering its current stage, PADO wanted to focus on building cryptographic algorithms to enable users to handle their private data securely instead of building and managing its wallet infrastructure.</p>\n<p><em>“A decision we made very early was that we did not want to invest our time in building the infrastructure to generate and manage users' private keys or custody their tokens in a way that assured users of their safety. We wanted to focus on building tools to handle users' private off-chain data securely.”</em>— Dr. Xiang Xie, Founder of PADO Labs.</p>\n<p>PADO also needed to invest heavily in web3 education as a Go-To-Market strategy since an average web3 user wouldn’t be enthusiastic about sharing their private data on-chain without sufficient education and security guarantees. This also meant that PADO needed to target and tap into an existing and mature web3 user base to get to market fast and scale.</p>\n<p>PADO also faced challenges related to access to funding and partnership opportunities within the ecosystem and mentorship from experienced builders who could provide technical advice.</p>\n<h2>Scaling the PADO protocol faster with MetaMask Developer</h2>\n<p>By integrating with the <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/metamask-wallet-api-build-power-dapps-with-web-3-s-leading-wallet/\">MetaMask Wallet API</a>, PADO provided a seamless onboarding experience for its users while leveraging MetaMask's years of industry experience in web3 security and tapping into the expertise of seasoned in-house JavaScript security experts. Additionally, MetaMask’s ethos of being open-source and permissionless, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/what-are-metamask-improvement-proposals-and-how-to-create-them/\">MIP</a> and <a href=\"https://metamask.io/news/developers/what-are-metamask-snaps-a-developer-intro/\">Snaps</a>, meant that PADO could easily extend the features of MetaMask by either contributing directly to the Wallet API or by building third-party permissionless Snaps.</p>\n<p><em>“For us, integrating with MetaMask was a no-brainer. We considered how extensive and supportive MetaMask is with Snaps, which made the decision easy. For example, we can build a custom Snap so that PADO users on MetaMask would not need to switch between extensions during the onboarding process but can instead start and finish their interaction on the MetaMask wallet”</em> - Xiang Xie, Founder of PADO Labs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/9sy2a0egs6zh/3avx9Mm5p8kGf5ay82bTA5/2d090d0c25b4d617c63f65bd2a377b4c/image2.jpg\" alt=\"PADO architecture\"></p>\n<p>Through the Consensys Fellowship and Linea Voyages, MetaMask Developer was able to help PADO quickly scale and gain 200k users by including them in the Linea Proof of Humanity Voyage and connecting them with MetaMask's large user base.

For example, a medical patient looking to move to a new provider would need help porting existing medical records due to how this data is stored - using centralized databases. This practice is not specific to healthcare providers, it is common in traditional finance, social media, and government.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://spruceid.com/\">SpruceID</a> recognizes that this can easily be solved by moving to a Data Vault Architecture where, instead of users’ data being stored and managed by third-party services, it resides in a secure, encrypted personal vault that the user operates.</p>\n<p>However, for this to work, an authentication standard that enables users to grant or revoke access to their data at any time is required. This standard would also need to be extensible enough to support consent-based sharing so that users have granular control over what data to share or not share on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is ensuring this authentication standard is recognized and adopted within the ecosystem among dapp developers. Additionally, specific security issues associated with this authentication method can only be solved at the wallet level. For example, if a website wants a user to sign a transaction, ensuring that the address in the user’s address bar is correct and that the request is being served over a secure network are complex security checks to implement at the dapp level. However, a wallet can easily enforce these.</p>\n<h2>MetaMask Developer implements EIP-4361 in collaboration with SpruceID</h2>\n<br />\n<p>Through authoring the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361\">(SIWE) standard</a>, the Spruce ID team created a user-controlled authentication method based on cryptography and users' public and private keys. With these keys, users can sign digital signatures that machines can’t spoof. Users can also sign permission slips for dapps to access their data vault. SIWE also offers granular control, allowing users to specify which resources in their data vault are involved in an interaction.</p>\n<p>To facilitate wider ecosystem adoption, particularly among dapp developers, SpruceID collaborated with MetaMask Developer to integrate SIWE into the MetaMask wallet as a feature. This collaboration helped address multiple security issues at the wallet level, leveraging the expertise of MetaMask's in-house JavaScript security experts. As a result, developers no longer need to handle these issues at the dapp level.</p>\n<p><em>\"Reflecting on our experience collaborating with the MetaMask Developer team, the two words that come to mind are <strong>'extremely responsive'</strong> and <strong>'thorough'</strong>. There were many iterations as we went back and forth, seeking the best outcome for users. We're grateful that the MetaMask Developer team recognized the potential to keep users safe\". - <strong>Wayne Chang, Founder, SpruceID</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>Additionally, through this collaboration, MetaMask Developer established a process for projects like SpruceID to propose new features and suggest changes to MetaMask Wallet API.

The MetaMask Community Calls allow us to engage with members and gather feedback while encouraging the community to raise specific concerns and suggest improvements using GitHub Issues. This approach has been effective in fixing bugs and improving documentation. However, to ensure community involvement in making significant changes to MetaMask Wallet API, a consistent, transparent, and controlled process is necessary, and that’s precisely what <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxIgYWK9294\">MetaMask Improvement Proposals</a> (MIPs) are.</p>\n<p>Inspired by aspects of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and React RFCs, MIPs provide a structured way for the developer community to propose new features, collect technical input on issues, and document the design changes to MetaMask Wallet API over time. While minor changes can be implemented and reviewed through the usual GitHub Issues and Pull Request workflow, additions and significant modifications to the MetaMask Wallet API, require a more careful approach due to the large number of developers and diverse applications reliant on these interfaces.</p>\n<p>Through MIPs, we aim to balance developer preferences for API designs and behaviors with considerations for user experience, privacy, and security while ensuring backward compatibility.</p>\n<h2>Who can submit a MetaMask Improvement Proposal?</h2>\n<br />\n<p>To ensure inclusivity while staying true to MetaMask's unique design principles, we have divided contributors into two distinct groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>MetaMask API maintainers:</strong> This group oversees the MetaMask Wallet API and reviews and approves MIPs submitted by the community. MIPs from this group can be seen as a \"request for comments\" because extensive design, discussion, and experimentation have already taken place internally. Submitting these MIPs allows the community to preview the design and provide valuable feedback. You can find the list of <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-improvement-proposals/blob/main/PROCESS-GUIDE.md#metamask-api-maintainers\">current MetaMask API maintainers here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>MetaMask community:</strong> This category encompasses everyone in the MetaMask community, including developers and end-users. MIPs submitted by this group are expected to initiate design discussions and are reviewed and approved by MetaMask API maintainers. While the MIP process can be thorough and time-consuming, we encourage community members to consider <a href=\"https://metamask.io/snaps/\">MetaMask Snaps</a> as an initial option for extending the MetaMask Wallet API capabilities since it offers a permissionless approach without needing a review process.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How the builder community  benefits from MetaMask Improvement Proposals</h2>\n<p><strong>Benefit for developers:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A structured approach to innovation: The MIP process provides a clear and organized mechanism for proposing, discussing, and implementing changes to the MetaMask Wallet API. This structure encourages developers to contribute innovative ideas and improvements, knowing maintainers will give all MIPs, comments, and feedback equal attention and consideration.</li>\n<li>A single source of truth through our API definitions in OpenRPC: Relatively unique in the industry, MIPs include API definitions in OpenRPC, ensuring that developers can effectively build against the API specifications, without the usual trial and error inherent in most APIs. Additionally, developers can create tooling around these specifications, similar to our auto-generated <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/json-rpc-api/\">interactive API reference</a>.</li>\n<li>A transparent and predictable roadmap for the MetaMask Wallet API: All proposals go through a defined lifecycle through the MIP process, from draft to implementation. This transparency ensures that developers clearly understand the status of different proposals and the future roadmap of the MetaMask Wallet API. With this visibility, developers can fully support and invest time in implementing changes.</li>\n<li>Prioritized feedback from developers integrating with MetaMask Wallet API: During the \"request for comments\" stage, proposals invite input from the broader developer community, particularly those actively integrating with MetaMask. This collaborative review process allows proposal authors to gain insights and perspectives from diverse developers. We can refine and create more effective API changes by incorporating this feedback.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Benefits for end-users:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Emphasis on privacy and security: The proposal evaluation process prioritizes privacy and security. This ensures users benefit from a secure MetaMask Wallet API that respects their data. Maintaining trust in the MetaMask ecosystem is crucial, and privacy and security considerations are significant in achieving that goal.</li>\n<li>Community-driven enhancements: By including community feedback in the MIP process, we ensure that changes to the MetaMask Wallet API align with our user base's actual needs and preferences.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to submit a MetaMask Improvement Proposal</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>If you're eager to contribute to shaping the future of the MetaMask Wallet API, the MIP process offers a clear and structured path to follow. Every proposal undergoes a <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-improvement-proposals/blob/main/PROCESS-GUIDE.md#proposal-lifecycle\">consistent lifecycle</a>, from drafting to implementation.

MetaMask processes 100M transactions monthly through more than 17,000  web3 dapps. This positions MetaMask as the preferred choice for developers who build dapps that attract web3 power users across networks and ecosystems.</p>\n<p>We created <a href=\"https://metamask.io/developer/\">MetaMask Developer</a>: to provide a comprehensive set of tools, APIs, and SDKs for onboarding millions of the web3’s most engaged users, built on the trusted and secure foundations of MetaMask and Infura.</p>\n<p>The first step to achieving this goal is to ensure that integrating with MetaMask is as seamless as possible. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193\">EIP-1193</a> focuses on establishing a uniform JavaScript Ethereum Provider API across clients and applications. This sets an industry standard for connecting to Ethereum wallets, which MetaMask supports through its Wallet API.</p>\n<h2>What is the MetaMask Wallet API</h2>\n<p>The MetaMask Wallet API is a global JavaScript API that can be connected to websites visited by users who have the MetaMask wallet installed via the <code>window.ethereum</code> provider object. Adhering to the EIP-1193 specification, the API enables Ethereum accounts to read blockchain data, suggest signing messages and transactions, and more.</p>\n<p>The Wallet API leverages the <code>window.ethereum.request(args)</code> function from the provider API to offer a suite of JSON-RPC APIs. This suite expands upon the standard Ethereum methods by incorporating MetaMask-specific enhancements, providing a comprehensive and versatile toolset for developers. The methods supported by the Wallet API are organized into several related  categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ethereum API</strong>: This category encompasses the standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API methods as defined by EIP 1193, the foundation for Ethereum blockchain interactions.</li>\n<li><strong>MetaMask</strong>: These are MetaMask-specific methods that provide functionality not necessarily supported by other wallets, offering unique features available only to MetaMask users.</li>\n<li><strong>Snaps</strong>: This category includes methods specific to the Snaps feature, allowing for a broader range of interactions within the MetaMask ecosystem.</li>\n<li><strong>Restricted</strong>: Methods under this category require explicit permission from the MetaMask user, obtained through the <code>wallet_requestPermissions</code> call, ensuring a secure and user-consented experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile</strong>: This category is dedicated to mobile-specific methods that are not supported by the desktop extension, tailoring the user experience for mobile users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a comprehensive overview of all methods supported by the MetaMask Wallet API, including their parameters, expected responses, and the categories they belong to, please refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/json-rpc-api/\">interactive API reference</a>.</p>\n<p>While developers have the option to integrate with MetaMask directly through the API, we recommend utilizing the <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-sdk/\">MetaMask SDK</a> for an enhanced and seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>Building upon the MetaMask API, the SDK is a comprehensive library designed to facilitate a reliable, secure, and smooth connection between your dapp and both the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile. This SDK allows for a variety of <a href=\"https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/concepts/sdk/#benefits-of-metamask-sdk\">connection methods to MetaMask</a> across different dapp platforms, eliminating the dependency on third-party libraries for integration.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the MetaMask SDK enhances the development experience by enabling automatic detection of the MetaMask wallet through EIP-6963. This eliminates the need for manual configuration or detection methods, thereby simplifying the initial setup process for developers and users alike.</p>\n<h2>Reasons to use the MetaMask Wallet API</h2>\n<p>Using the MetaMask Wallet API offers five key advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access to MetaMask-specific methods</strong>: The Wallet API provides developers with several MetaMask-specific, battle-tested methods that enable tracking of specific tokens and assets, permission requests, redirection of onboarded users back to your dapp, and simplification of the connect &#x26; sign experience, among others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access to an established power user base</strong>: Developers gain access to MetaMask's extensive user base, which includes over 100M installs and 30M monthly active users, and processes 100M monthly transactions through more than 17,000 connected web3 dapps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cross-chain support</strong>: MetaMask supports all EVM chains and can be extended to support other chains through MetaMask Snaps, which facilitates transactions and dapps on networks such as Sui, Solana, Bitcoin, Algorand, Cosmos, Tezos, and Polkadot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unified, cross-platform support</strong>: The MetaMask SDK supports dapps across JavaScript, iOS, Android, and game engines, allowing developers to integrate with MetaMask using just a few lines of code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integration with popular libraries</strong>: The MetaMask SDK integrates with popular web3 connection libraries like Wagmi, web3onboard, web3 react, ethers.js, web3 auth, WalletConnect, and other wallet-agnostic connection libraries, fitting seamlessly into existing workflows.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Build with the MetaMask Wallet API to onboard millions of web3 power users to your dapp</h2>\n<p>Connecting with the MetaMask Wallet API offers an unparalleled opportunity to tap into a vast network of web3 enthusiasts and power users.
