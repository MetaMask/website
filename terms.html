      <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
        <p>ConsenSys Software Inc. (“<strong>ConsenSys</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) is the leading blockchain software development company. With a focus on utilizing decentralized technologies, such as Ethereum, our software is powering a revolution in commerce and finance and helping to optimize business processes. ConsenSys hosts a top level domain website, www.consensys.net, that serves information regarding ConsenSys and our offerings, as well as sub-domains for our product offerings (the “<strong>Sites</strong>”), which include text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information. </p>
        <p>These Terms of Use (the “<strong>Terms</strong>,” “<strong>Terms of Use</strong>” or “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Services (as defined below) provided by us and is an agreement between us and you or the entity you represent (“<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>your</strong>”). Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using the Site or Services. By using the Site, or clicking a button or checkbox to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available or, completing an order form for Services, or,  if earlier, using or otherwise accessing the Services (the “<strong>Effective Date</strong>”), you (1) accept and agree to these Terms and any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation issued by ConsenSys from time to time and (2) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our <a href="https://consensys.net/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy.</a> If you do not agree to the Terms, then you may not access or use the Services. </p>
        <p>You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 16 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.</p>
        <p>In addition, you represent to us that you and your financial institutions, or any party that owns or controls you or your financial institutions, are (1) not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. Government (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Entity List of the U.S. Department of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable government authority and (2) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any sanctions.</p>
        <h4>1. The Services.</h4>
        <p>1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Service Offerings.</p>
        <p>1.2 Offerings and Access. ConsenSys offers a number of products (each a “<strong>Service</strong>”) under the ConsenSys brand or brands owned by us. These include Codefi, PegaSys, Quorum, Infura, MetaMask and others. Services are accessed through the Site, unless otherwise agreed in writing or otherwise offered. Some Services may require you to create an Account, enter a valid form of payment, and select a paid plan (a “<strong>Plan</strong>”), or initiate an Order for a Plan or Service. </p>
        <p>1.3 Third-Party Content. In certain Services, Third-Party Content may be used by you at your election. Third-Party Content is governed by this Agreement and, if applicable, separate terms and conditions accompanying such Third-Party Content, which terms and conditions may include separate fees and charges.</p>
        <p>1.4 Third-Party Services. When you use our Services, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties. Your use of these third party services may be subject to the separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties.</p>
        <h4>2. Changes.</h4>
        <p>2.1 To the Services. We may change or discontinue any or all of the Services or change or remove functionality of any or all of the Services from time to time. We will notify you of any material change to or discontinuation of the Services. If you are on a Plan, you will be notified of any material changes to the Service at least 30 days in advance of such change. For any discontinuation of or material change to a Service, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the previous version of the Service for three months after the change or discontinuation (except if doing so (a) would pose a security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would cause us to violate the law or requests of governmental entities).</p>
        <p>2.2 To this Agreement. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement (including any Policies) at any time. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Services following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
        <h4>3. Your Responsibilities.</h4>
        <p>3.1 Your Accounts. Except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your Account.</p>
        <p>3.2 Your Use. You will ensure that Your Use of the Services does not violate any applicable law. You are solely responsible for Your Use of the Services. </p>
        <p>3.3 Your Security and Backup. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your Accounts and Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption.</p>
        <p>3.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys. To the extent we provide you with log-in credentials and API authentication generated by the Services, such log-in credentials and API authentication are for your internal use only and you will not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.</p>
        <h4>4. Fees and Payment.</h4>
        <p>4.1 Publicly Available Services. Some Services, including paid Services up to a certain use threshold, may be offered to the public and licensed on a royalty free basis. </p>
        <p>4.2 Service Fees. Unless otherwise specified in an Order form for Services, to the extent a Service incurs fees, we calculate and bill fees and charges monthly according to your Plan or as otherwise advertised and charged on the Service (the “<strong>On Use Fees</strong>”). On Use Fees are charged contemporaneously with your use of the Services. For Services under a Plan, on the first day of each billing period, you will pay us the applicable fees (the “<strong>Base Fees</strong>”) and any applicable taxes based on the Services in the plan that you selected (the “<strong>Selected Plan</strong>”). In addition, we may, for particular Services as defined in your Order, issue an invoice to you for all charges above the applicable threshold for your Selected Plan (the “<strong>Applicable Threshold</strong>”) based on your use of the Services during the previous billing period (the “<strong>Overage Fees</strong>” and, together with the Base Fees, the “<strong>Fees</strong>”) as those Overage Fees are defined in your Plan. If you make any other changes to the Services during a billing period (e.g. upgrading or downgrading your Selected Plan), we will apply any additional charges or credits to the next billing period. We may bill you more frequently for Fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the Fees for use of the Service Offerings in U.S. dollars unless otherwise agreed to in writing. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we communicate updated fees and charges to you, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.</p>
        <p>4.3 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All Fees payable by you are exclusive taxes unless otherwise noted. We reserve the right to withhold taxes where required.</p>
        <h4>5. Temporary Suspension; Limiting API Requests.</h4>
        <p>5.1 Generally. We may suspend Your right to access or use any portion or all of the Services immediately upon notice to you if we determine:</p>
        <p>(a) your use of the Services (i) poses a security risk to the Services or any third party, (ii) could adversely impact our systems, the Services or the systems of any other user, (iii) could subject us, our affiliates, or any third party to liability, or (iv) could be fraudulent;</p>
        <p>(b) you are, or any End User is, in breach of this Agreement;</p>
        <p>(c) you are in breach of your payment obligations under Section 4 and such breach continues for 30 days or longer; or</p>
        <p>(d) for entities, you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of your assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.</p>
        <p>5.2 Effect of Suspension. If we suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of the Services:</p>
        <p>(a) you remain responsible for all Fees and charges you incur during the period of suspension; and</p>
        <p>(b) you will not be entitled to any service credits for any period of suspension.</p>
        <p>5.3 Limiting API Requests. If applicable to a particular Service, we retain sole discretion to limit your usage of the Services (including without limitation by limiting the number of API requests you may submit (“<strong>API Requests</strong>”)) at any time if your usage of the Services exceeds the applicable Threshold for your Selected Plan of Service.</p>
        <h4>6. Term; Termination.</h4>
        <p>6.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated under this Section 6. Any notice of termination of this Agreement by either party to the other must include a Termination Date that complies with the notice periods in Section 6.2.</p>
        <p>6.2 Termination.</p>
        <p>(a) Termination for Convenience. You may terminate this Agreement for any reason by, in the case of Plan’s not requiring an Account, ceasing use of the service. In the case of paid Plan(s) or Plan(s) requiring an account, only in accordance with your Order. In the case of Plan’s not requiring an Account, we may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing you at least 30 days’ written notice.

        <p>(b) Termination for Cause.</p>

        <p>(ii) By Us. We may also terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to you (A) for cause if we have the right to suspend under Section 5, (B) if our relationship with a third-party partner who provides software or other technology we use to provide the Services expires, terminates or requires us to change the way we provide the software or other technology as part of the Services, or (C) in order to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities.</p>
        <p>6.3 Effect of Termination. Upon the Termination Date:</p>
        <p>(i) all your rights under this Agreement immediately terminate;</p>
        <p>(ii) each party remains responsible for all fees and charges it has incurred through the Termination Date and are responsible for any fees and charges it incurs during the post-termination period;</p>
        <p>(iii) Sections 3, 4, 6.3, 7 (except the license granted to you in Section 7.2), 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14 will continue to apply in accordance with their terms.</p>
        <p>For any use of the Services after the Termination Date, the terms of this Agreement will again apply and, if your use is for a paid Plan, you will pay the applicable fees at the rates under Section 4.</p>

Any dispute, claim or controversy (“<strong>Claim</strong>”) relating in any way to this Agreement, the Site, or your use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this Section 11, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>
        <p>11.1.1 If you are located in the United States: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New York state court located in New York County, New York. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable.  If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. </p>
        <p>11.1.2 If you are located in the United Kingdom: This agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Services, your use of the Services, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be London.</p>
        <p>11.1.3 If you are located in any territory that is not specifically enumerated in Sections 11.1.1 or 11.1.2, you may elect for either of Section 11.1.1 or 11.1.2 to apply to you, otherwise this agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of Ireland. Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Services, your use of the Services, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the LCIA Mediation Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. If the dispute is not settled by mediation within 14 days of the commencement of the mediation, or such further period as the parties shall agree in writing, the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be Dublin, Ireland.</p>
        <p>11.2 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
        <p>11.3 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: via email at notices@consensys.net with subject line LEGAL OPT OUT. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Services, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we will also not be bound by them.</p>
