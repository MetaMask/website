        <h4><strong>5.1. Warranty disclaimer</strong></h4>
        <p>You expressly understand and agree that your use of the Services is at your sole risk. The Services (including the Site, the App and the Content) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. You acknowledge that MetaMask has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding: which users gain access to or use the Services; what effects the Content may have on you; how you may interpret or use the Content; or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content. You release MetaMask from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. MetaMask makes no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and MetaMask will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.</p>
        <p>We do not represent or warrant that access to the Services will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely or secure. You acknowledge and accept that the Services (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of data and (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or without notice to you.</p>

        <h4><strong>5.2 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems</strong></h4>
        <p>By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Content or platform in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens such as Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow an Ethereum token standard (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20">https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20</a>), and blockchain-based software systems.</p>
        <h4><strong>5.3 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</strong></h4>
        <p>MetaMask and any supported cryptographic token and blockchain could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of MetaMask to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services or the underlying blockchain network.</p>
        <h4><strong>5.4 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography</strong></h4>
        <p>You acknowledge and understand that Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and Services of Content, which could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent possible, MetaMask intends to update the protocol underlying Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using the Services or accessing Content, you acknowledge these inherent risks.</p>
        <h4><strong>5.5 Volatility of Cryptocurrencies</strong></h4>
        <p>You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and associated cryptographic tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the blockchain network. You acknowledge these risks and agree that MetaMask cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.</p>
        <h4><strong>5.6 Application Security</strong></h4>
        <p>You further acknowledge that blockchain applications are code subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Services or Content and the trustworthiness of any third-party websites, products, smart-contracts, or Content you access or use through the Services.

It interacts with, and relies on, a third party application, including the underlying payment channel network. You accept that there are risks with using Instapay, including without limitation, inability to access any digital assets that are locked in the payment channel or its smart contract, which may be caused by communication failures, unavailability of the third party network or software bugs or errors in the App or the third party application or network or any other reason. You agree that MetaMask is not responsible for any loss in your digital assets or delay in accessing such digital assets. We may cap the maximum amount of digital assets that you may deposit into Instapay and we may increase or decrease this cap in our sole discretion without notice to you. We may disable Instapay at our sole discretion, including as part of any planned upgrades of Instapay or any other part of the Services.

        <p>You acknowledge that the Swaps functionality is experimental in nature. Swaps interacts with, and relies on, third party applications.

        <h3><strong>13. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></h3>
        <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT<strong><br></strong></p>
        <h4><strong>13.1 Initial Dispute Resolution<br></strong></h4>
        <p>The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.<strong><br></strong></p>
        <h4><strong>13.2 Binding Arbitration<br></strong></h4>
        <p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “<strong>AAA</strong>”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.<strong><br></strong></p>
        <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<strong><br></strong></p>
        <p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.<strong><br></strong></p>
        <h3><strong>13.3 Location<br></strong></h3>
        <p>Binding arbitration shall take place in New York.

        <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND METAMASK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
