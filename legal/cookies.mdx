This Cookies Policy describes how Consensys Software Inc. (“**Company**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) collects, uses, shares, and stores cookies in relation to our top level domain website, consensys.io, as well as sub-domains for our products or services (the top level domain with the sub-domains collectively referred to as the “**Sites**”). This Policy applies to the Sites, applications, products and services (collectively, “**Services**”) on or in which it is posted, linked, or referenced.

We understand that your privacy is important to you and are committed to being transparent about the technologies we use. In the spirit of transparency, this Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Sites.

<br/>

**_Do we use Cookies?_**

Yes. We and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use cookies, web beacons, or pixels and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Sites has the best possible experience.

<br/>

**_What is a Cookie?_**

A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the Sites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.

<br/>

**_Why do we use Cookies?_**

We generally use Cookies for the following purposes:

- To recognize new or past customers.
- To store your password if you are registered on our Sites.
- To improve our Sites and to better understand your visits on our platforms and Sites.
- To serve you with interest-based marketing.
- To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
- To better understand the interests of our customers and visitors to our Sites.

Some Cookies are necessary for certain uses of the Sites, and without such Cookies, we would not be able to provide many services that you need to properly use the Sites. These Cookies, for example, allow us to operate our Sites so you may access it as you have requested and let us recognize that you have created an account and have logged into that account to access content on our Sites. They also include Cookies that enable us to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.  

We also use functional Cookies and Cookies from third parties for analysis and marketing purposes.  Functional Cookies enable certain parts of the Sites to work properly and your user preferences to remain known.  Analysis Cookies, among other things, collect information on how visitors use our Sites, the content and products that users view most frequently, and the effectiveness of our third party advertising. Advertising Cookies assist in delivering ads to relevant audiences and having our ads appear at the top of search results. Cookies are either “session” Cookies which are deleted when you end your browser session, or “persistent,” which remain until their deletion by you (discussed below) or the party who served the cookie.  Full details on all of the Cookies used on the Sites are available at our Cookie Disclosure table below.

#### LOCAL STORAGE POLICY

Local Storage, including Javascript-enabled localStorage, is a typical way for a website to store a small file of letters and numbers in your browser. We use Local Storage in some of our Services in order to assign you a unique user ID for purposes of communication with you. Local Storage is deleted when the website that stored them deletes them. You can also delete Local Storage from your browser at any time you like by visiting your web browser settings.

How to Clear Local Storage from Your Browser:

- In Firefox, localStorage is cleared when the following conditions are met: (a) user clears recent history, (b) cookies are selected to be cleared, and (c) time range is “Everything.”
- In Chrome, localStorage is cleared when the following conditions are met: (a) clear browsing data, (b) “cookies and other site data” is selected, and (c) timeframe is “from beginning of time.” In Chrome, it is also now possible to delete localStorage for one specific site.
- In IE, to clear localStorage: (a) click on Tools–Internet Options, (b) General tab, (c) delete browsing history on exit, (d) ensure “Cookies and website data” (or “temporary internet files and website files”) is selected, and (e) consider unchecking “Preserve Favorites website data” at the top.
- In Safari, (a) Click Safari, (b) Preferences, (c) Select the Privacy tab, (d) Click Remove all website data and (e) Click Remove Now
