## CONSENSYS SOFTWARE INC. GLOBAL PRIVACY NOTICE

Date of Last Revision: 20 Sep 2024
<br />
Effective: 18 June 2024

Consensys Software Inc. is the leading blockchain and web3 software company which provides services to users, creators and developers under brands such as MetaMask, MetaMask Institutional, MetaMask Developer, Infura, Diligence, Linea, Consensys Staking, Teku, Besu and Phosphor.

Consensys Software Inc. (“Consensys,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) knows your personal information is important. As a result, we process your personal information responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

We appreciate the trust you place in us when you use our products and services, and when you visit our websites, https://consensys.io/, https://metamask.io/, https://metamask.io/institutions/, https://metamask.io/developer/, https://infura.io/, https://consensys.io/diligence/, https://linea.build/, https://consensys.io/staking, https://consensys.io/teku, https://besu.hyperledger.org and https://phosphor.xyz (“Sites”). This Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) applies to the Sites (including subdomains), applications, products and services (collectively, “Services”) on or in which it is posted, linked, or referenced.

This Privacy Notice describes how we process the personal information collected when you access the Services. When you leave the Services, this Privacy Notice no longer applies. Any subsequent website, application, or service you access is subject to its own terms of service and privacy notice (if any) and not this Privacy Notice.

This Privacy Notice tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your personal information, including how you can contact us if you have any questions or concerns. In this Privacy Notice “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural living individual.

<u>Please read this Privacy Notice carefully.</u> If you do not agree with this Privacy Notice or any
part thereof, you should not access or use any part of the Services. If you change your mind in the future,
you must stop using the Services. You may exercise your rights in relation to your Personal Information
as set out in this Privacy Notice and you may contact us at any time regarding those rights using the
methods described in the “Contact Us” section below.

> MetaMask privacy tl;dr
>
> MetaMask users - what does this mean for you?
>
> We take great care to protect the safety, security and privacy of MetaMask users, and to give users the ability to control and configure their wallet to meet their personal needs. We provide a detailed overview of the settings that we allow users to configure based on their individual experience and privacy preferences. This overview can be found at our MetaMask News site ([here](https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask)).
>
> We have updated our Privacy Notice to continue providing transparency on our processing activities. In summary, for MetaMask users this means that we:
>
> - do not collect your private keys.
> - do not sell your Personal Information.
> - do not collect or retain Personal Information unless necessary to provide you the Services and a great user experience (see below for details).
> - for IP addresses in particular, we may temporarily process your IP address only where required for some of our Services (depending on your MetaMask settings) to provide the best possible experience for MetaMask users. This includes, for example, the prevention of DDoS attacks (see below for more details).
> - do not collect financial payment or banking information, however, when you use our on- or off-ramp features these services may necessitate you submitting this information to third-party providers.
>
> We may temporarily process IP addresses, only where necessary and to provide the best possible experience for MetaMask users. This includes the following purposes:
>
> - for the basic functionality of our Services where you make requests from your device in relation to the Services. This is a necessary feature of offering our Services on the internet;
> - to run third-party requests through proxy infrastructure, thereby eliminating your individual device details and IP address from the request that is ultimately received by third-parties. For example, instead of MetaMask sending traffic directly from your device to multiple third-party services, we may run the request through a proxy to improve performance and/or privacy for you;
> - for providing you with the best experience when using the Services (e.g. to measure latency, volume of requests per region and to route your requests to servers close to your region to improve your experience of the Services) or where interactions with Third Party Platforms are required (depending on your MetaMask settings);
> - where we are required to do so to comply with our legal obligations (e.g. to help us avoid providing services to regions prohibited by sanctions laws); and
> - to ensure the safety, security and integrity of the Services (e.g. for the prevention of DDoS attacks).
>
> If users wish to further limit the collection of their device and usage information, users could consider the use of virtual private networks, or ‘VPNs’.
>
> We do not collect other Personal Information that we do not need. Personal Information that we may process is set out below at Section 2 (including information that you may provide to us and information that is collected automatically). For MetaMask users, this includes:
>
> - Wallet related information, including your wallet address which is temporarily processed as part of API requests (in URL parameters or bodies) when making API calls required to support the user experience. Please note that this applies where you utilise MetaMask’s default settings and configurations, which you may disable or opt-out of at any time.
> - Your MetaMask preferences and settings, only as necessary to provide the Service. Generally this information is stored locally on your device. To the extent that we process this information to facilitate cross-device functionality, it is encrypted such that it can only be decrypted by you on your device(s).
> - Feedback and survey responses, where you choose to provide this information.
> - User event information, where you opt-in to analytics data collection (also known as MetaMetrics), to support continued improvement of the product experience. We store this data pseudonymously and we do not link it to other Personal Information unless you ask us to do so. You may disable this feature at any time.
> - Marketing related information, where you opt-in to share this information (like information from cookies). This helps us to learn how you interact with our marketing communications and personalize what we share with you, such as latest developments and product features. You may disable this feature at any time.
> - Device related information, where you opt-in to receive notifications from your MetaMask wallet. For example, if you opt-in and ask us to provide push notifications to your mobile device, we will retain your device identifier to facilitate such notifications for as long as you remain opted-in. You may disable this feature at any time.
>
> Please note that the use of data described above applies when you utilise MetaMask’s default settings and configurations (which you may disable or opt-out of at any time), such as using Infura as the default Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provider. See a detailed overview of the settings that we allow users to configure based on their individual experience and privacy preferences at our MetaMask News site ([here](https://metamask.io/news/latest/product-spotlight-privacy-preserving-features-in-metamask)).

In the last 12 months, we have allowed third party ad providers to collect Personal Information from visitors to certain Services (for example, our websites) for the purposes of advertising and analytics. This practice may constitute the “sharing” (which is a term used to address the sharing of information for advertising purposes) of Personal Information.
To the extent that our practices constitute the sharing of your Personal Information, you have the right to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Information with the third parties in this Privacy Notice by contacting us using the methods described at Section 16 of the [_Global Privacy Notice_](https://consensys.io/privacy-notice). You can also opt-out by enabling Global Privacy Control (see Section 2 above).

#### 4. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information

You have the right to know whether your Personal Information is being sold. We do not sell your Personal Information. Your personal information is “sold” when it is provided to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration for a purpose that is not a “business purpose” as set forth in the CCPA or other U.S. state data privacy laws. Please note a “sale” does not include when we disclose your personal information at your direction, or when otherwise permitted under law.

#### 5. Right to Opt-out of Sharing

We do not sell your Personal Information, so we do not offer an opt out. We may “share” personal information with third parties for personalized advertising purposes as described above. You may indicate your choice to opt-out of the sharing of your personal data with third parties for personalized advertising on third party sites by contacting us using the methods described at Section 16 of the [_Global Privacy Notice_](https://consensys.io/privacy-notice). You can also opt-out by enabling Global Privacy Control (see Section 2 above).

Even if you turn off “sharing,” you may still see personalized ads based on information other companies and ad networks have collected about you, if you have not opted out of sharing with them.

#### 6. Non-Discrimination

U.S. state privacy laws prohibit businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Discrimination may include denying services, providing a different level or quality of service, or charging different prices. We do not discriminate.
