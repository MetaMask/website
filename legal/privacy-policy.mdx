#### WHAT WE COLLECT

We get information about you in a range of ways. 

**Information You Give Us**. Information we collect from you may include:

- Identity information, such as your first name, last name, username or similar identifier, title, date of birth and gender;
- Contact information, such as your postal address, email address and telephone number;
- Profile information, such as your username and password, interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses;
- Feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide in your responses to surveys, when you participate in market research activities, report a problem with Service, receive customer support or otherwise correspond with us;
- Financial information, such as your credit card or other payment card details;

**Information collected by Infura when you use Infura as your default RPC provider in MetaMask.** https://metamask.io/ (**“MetaMask”**) and https://infura.io/ (**“Infura”**) are both products offered by the Company and Infura is the default Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provider in MetaMask. When you use Infura as your default RPC provider in MetaMask, Infura will collect your IP address and your Ethereum wallet address when you send a transaction. However, if you’re using your own Ethereum node or a third party RPC provider with MetaMask, then neither Infura nor MetaMask will collect your IP address or Ethereum wallet address (but you should be aware your information will be subject to whatever information collection performed by the RPC provider you are using and their terms regarding such collection).

**Further Information You Give Us In Relation to the Codefi Site and Codefi Services.** Further information we collect from you in relation to https://consensys.io/staking/ (the “Codefi Site”) and Codefi Services may include:

- Further identity information, such as your country of birth, nationality, social security number, place of birth, employer and occupation;

- Information required to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements (such as nationality and place of birth);
- Source of funds for participating in token launches; and
- Information that you give us in relation to your purchased token holdings, such as earnings received from staking, and the number of tokens in your wallet.

**Information We Get From Others.** We may get information about you from other third party sources and we may add this to information we get from your use of the Services. Such information may include:

- Registration using Single Sign-On Account: When registering some user accounts (e.g. with the Codefi Site), you also have the option of using a single sign-on account (“SSO”). With an SSO, you can sign up for various different services and platforms with a single account. Some of our Sites currently offer you the opportunity to use the SSO services offered by  Google, LLC, Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply to the registration and use of the Google SSO service, see https://policies.google.com/privacy/. Please note that the registration for and the use of SSO services are subject to the Google privacy policy and terms of use, which are beyond our control.

**Information Automatically Collected.** We may automatically record certain information about how you use our Sites (we refer to this information as “Log Data“). Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device and browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Sites to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, the frequency with which the Sites are used by a user, search terms, the links on our Sites that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Service and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Service by expanding its features and functionality and tailoring it to our users’ needs and preferences.

We may use cookies, local storage or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movements around the Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies and local storage at the individual browser level. For more information, please see our [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies/).

We also may use Google Analytics to help us offer you an optimized user experience.  You can find more information about Google Analytics’ use of your personal data here: https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Please note that Metamask does not use Google Analytics in its wallet.

We also use Mixpanel in some of our Services in order to better understand how you are using the Sites. You can find more information about Mixpanel’s use of your personal data here: https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/.

We use Hotjar in some of our Services in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices (in particular device’s IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our Sites). Hotjar stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user. For further details, please see Hotjar’s privacy policy by clicking on this [link](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy/). Please note that Metamask does not use Hotjar.
